Kate Springer,What will the national security law mean for travelers -- and Hong Kong's tourism recovery?,"Hong Kong (CNN) — When it comes to desirable post-pandemic travel destinations, Hong Kong would be an obvious choice thanks to its capable handling of Covid-19 outbreaks, which has so far limited infections to just 1,300 cases in the city of 7.5 million.

But now, some travelers may be worried about visiting for a totally different reason.

On June 30, the Chinese government introduced a national security law in Hong Kong that outlaws ""acts of secession, subversion of state power, terrorist activities and collusion with foreign or external forces to endanger national security.""

Hong Kong authorities insist the law will ""only target an extremely small minority of people ,"" yet its broad language and global scope raise questions about what it means for foreign travelers -- and the city's tourism recovery -- once Covid-19 travel restrictions ease.

The new law's Article 34 states that foreigners in Hong Kong could be ""subject to deportation"" if they contravene the law, even if they are not prosecuted. Meanwhile, Article 38 asserts that the law applies to offenses committed ""outside the region"" by foreigners who are not residents of Hong Kong or China.

This language has spurred discussions in countries such as the United States, Canada, Australia and the UK, prompting them to revise their respective travel advisories, warning citizens of increased risks and ""surveillance,"" ""detention"" and ""deportation"" under the new law, which details a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.

""Combined with Covid-19 and the protests, the national security law has created lots of uncertainty about the upcoming recovery,"" Herbert Yum, a Hong Kong research manager at market research provider Euromonitor International , tells CNN Travel.

""We can expect that visitors from the US and UK will decrease significantly (after Covid-19 restrictions relax) because both governments have expressed lots of concern about the safety and stability of Hong Kong. However, tourists from mainland China, which make up approximately 70% of Hong Kong's total (overnight) tourism arrivals, could feel safer and more willing to come to Hong Kong.""

Will the law impact travelers?

According to a Hong Kong government spokesperson, the national security law should not affect the ""vast majority of Hong Kong people including tourists and investors... who abide by the law and do not participate in acts or activities that undermine national security.""

When asked for specific examples of what types of ""acts or activities"" would impact foreigners visiting Hong Kong, the spokesperson did not elaborate.

However, a Hong Kong Tourism Board spokesperson offered reassurances: ""It's difficult to ascertain the impact of the national security law on Hong Kong tourism at the moment, but it is highly unlikely that bona fide tourists will be affected at all.""

Even so, many foreign governments have expressed concerns about the law. Following its implementation last week, the US State Department revised its travel advisory for Hong Kong

Designated a Level 2 (out of 4) risk level, meaning US citizens should ""exercise increased caution,"" the advisory warns: ""US citizens traveling or residing in Hong Kong may be subject to increased levels of surveillance, as well as arbitrary enforcement of laws and detention for purposes other than maintaining law and order (as a result of the national security law).""

Australia made a similar move, updating its travel advisory to read: ""(The national security law) could be interpreted broadly. You can break the law without intending to. The maximum penalty under this law in Hong Kong is life imprisonment.""

In Canada, authorities warn travelers that they ""may be at increased risk of arbitrary detention on national security grounds and possible extradition to mainland China.""

And in the UK, the Foreign & Commonwealth Office states: ""Mainland authorities could under certain circumstances detain individuals under the terms of this law, with a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. There is therefore an increased risk of detention, and deportation for a non-permanent resident, who commits an offense under the law.""

Professor Xin He, a Chinese law expert at the University of Hong Kong's Department of Law, calls these travel warnings ""overblown.""

""Tourists are extremely unlikely to offend those serious crimes specified by the law,"" he tells CNN Travel, noting that neighboring Macao, which is also a special administrative region of China, has similar laws.

""The law is trying to stabilize Hong Kong's situation and attract more tourists.""

Sharing this sentiment, Hong Kong Tourism Board chairman Pang Yiu-kai told the South China Morning Post , a Hong Kong-based, English-language publication, that he didn't think the law would scare away travelers since foreigners still visit mainland China, which also has a national security law.

However, Benjamin Iaquinto, an assistant professor and tourism geographer at the University of Hong Kong, questions such comparisons.

""Yes, tourists still go to China (despite the local laws), they still go see the Great Wall and the Forbidden City and all that,"" Iaquinto tells CNN Travel.

""But those places are so remarkable that you're always going to get tourists to visit them no matter what. Hong Kong doesn't have places like the Great Wall or the Forbidden City, which might be a problem for the tourism industry.""

'Tourists don't like risk'

Senior tourism lecturer Denis Tolkach, who recently transitioned from the School of Hotel and Tourism Management at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University to James Cook University in Australia, says experts are still wrapping their heads around the law.

""There was no draft available until it had passed through the legislature, so we only saw the text on July 1,"" says Tolkach.

""Most legal scholars are still trying to understand what the language means and what repercussions it will have -- that creates uncertainty. Tourists don't like risk and they don't like uncertainty.""

A silver lining, he says, is that no one is heading to Hong Kong right now.

""You could say it's a good thing that currently there is no travel due to the coronavirus anyway. People have the time to decide whether they want to travel to Hong Kong or not, as they watch the situation unfold.""

If no incidents involving tourists occur under the national security law after the borders reopen, he says the perceived risk will likely diminish.

""If you see that other people are traveling without any problems, people will be more relaxed,"" adds Tolkach.

""But you need to be informed about the place you are traveling to and respect the local customs, whether those are cultural or legal. So be informed.""

Running afoul of the law

The enactment of Hong Kong national security law has sparked wide concerns and fears in Hong Kong. In a latest move, the city's Education Bureau ordered schools to remove books that could violate the law. Speaking to CNN's Ivan Watson , pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong reacts to the controversial bill.

As experts grapple with what's illegal under the new legislation, Professor He says that common concerns such as ""criticizing the leaders of China"" on social media would not ""fall into any of the crimes specified in the law.""

He also says it would be ""extremely unlikely or almost impossible"" for tourists to be detained or extradited to mainland China.

However, providing ""donations and other support to those criminals specified in the NSL (national security law) may be problematic.""

Antony Dapiran, a Hong Kong-based lawyer, photographer and writer who is the author of ""City on Fire: The Fight for Hong Kong,"" agrees that ""ordinary people who have no political involvement or exposure and no public profile"" would not be impacted.

Foreigners or members of the Hong Kong diaspora could be at risk if they ""engaged in anti-government activism abroad,"" particularly if that activism was ""directed towards either secession -- Hong Kong independence or, for that matter, other independence causes such as Taiwan, Tibet or Xinjiang -- or subversion of the Chinese government.""

If business or leisure travelers have ""engaged with foreign governments or organizations in furtherance of those causes,"" he says they could be considered criminals.

""Those who have an elevated risk profile -- such as people involved in anti-China activism abroad, or business travelers in industries and sectors which have an elevated risk exposure -- would no doubt consider their travel plans in light of the new law,"" says Dapiran.

Entering recovery mode

While the law may concern travelers from Western countries, experts agree that it could have the opposite effect on visitors from mainland China -- by far the city's largest and most important tourism market.

""In mainland China, people are not very used to seeing protests -- and this kind of social unrest makes people feel at risk,"" explains Tolkach.

""So if we look at the mainland Chinese visitors, the national security law is supposed to ensure the safety and security of Hong Kong -- (it's) something to be viewed positively by Chinese tourists, to reassure them.""

The city welcomed roughly 51 million tourists from mainland China in 2018 -- or roughly 78% of the 65.1 million total arrivals in 2018, according to data from the Hong Kong Tourism Board , which includes both overnight and same-day visits.

""The major protests started in June (of 2019), but travel was not really affected until about August when the protests and the police response became more intense,"" says Tolkach.

""In November, because of the occupation of the universities -- including Hong Kong Polytechnic University and the Chinese University of Hong Kong -- arrivals dropped by about 50% ... it was most significant for the mainland Chinese market.""

He says a lot of the fear stems from media coverage in mainland China.

""Media outlets in mainland China were portraying the protests very negatively, so it created a lot of uncertainty and Hong Kong felt like a risky destination.""

By the end of last year, total arrivals had decreased 14.2% from 65.1 million in 2018 to 55.9 million in 2019.

This year, the industry has been hit even harder. Due to Covid-19 travel restrictions, the city saw just 3.5 million arrivals between January and May 2020, compared with 29.7 million in the same period last year.

Currently, only Hong Kong residents and some visitors from mainland China, Macao and Taiwan can enter the city. All arrivals must take a compulsory Covid-19 test and quarantine for 14 days.

In the coming months, Euromonitor researcher Yum predicts that Hong Kong tourism will see a sharp recovery once the government finalizes ""travel bubble"" agreements, which may allow quarantine-exempt travel between destinations like Thailand, Japan and mainland China.

""When Hong Kong reopens its borders, visitors from the Asia-Pacific region may rebound quickly,"" adds Yum.

However, the long-term impacts remain unclear.

Hong Kong's evolving image

Tourists rarely make decisions based on politics when it comes to choosing travel destinations, says Iaquinto, pointing to examples like Thailand and Sri Lanka -- two nearby destinations that have maintained successful tourism industries despite long-term political unrest.

However, Hong Kong's image is rooted in its reputation as an open, free and transparent city -- unique selling points that set it apart from some of its neighbors.

""One of the things that makes Hong Kong thrive as a tourism destination is its openness,"" says Iaquinto.

""You have very favorable visa entry requirements for a lot of different passport holders. It has a major airport, which is a massive hub for global air travel.

""If you look at Shenzhen, right across the border, it is like night and day. It is very different.""

Depending on how the law is implemented, Tolkach believes it could also make it challenging for Hong Kong to separate its image from China.

""Hong Kong has a strong brand legacy, and leisure tourists generally are not that political. But if things continue as they are, maybe even Hong Kong, a world-renowned tourist destination, won't be as attractive to international markets,"" explains Tolkach.

""Increasingly, people will be thinking about Hong Kong as part of China, rather than an autonomous entity. So the destination's image and the other related issues, like trusting the authorities, will be similar.",2020-07-12,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/hong-kong-travel-national-security-law/index.html

Tamara Hardingham-Gill,Which international destinations are reopening to tourists?,"(CNN) — Although many governments are still advising against ""nonessential"" international travel , a host of popular destinations are beginning to ease their Covid-19 lockdown measures and border restrictions and are moving toward welcoming tourists back.

On July 1, the European Union announced it would be reopening its external border to 15 countries outside of the bloc in a bid to boost its travel industry.

Algeria, Australia, Canada, Georgia, Japan, Montenegro, Morocco, New Zealand, Rwanda, Serbia, South Korea, Thailand, Tunisia and Uruguay are all included in the list, along with China, provided it agrees to lift restrictions on EU citizens.

However, the United States, which now has the highest number of confirmed Covid-19 infections in the world, according to Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center, was not included.

""Travel bubbles"" are also becoming more popular, with the likes of Fiji, Australia and New Zealand considering following the lead of Baltic states Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, who have lifted restrictions for each other's citizens.

Meanwhile the UK has formed ""travel corridors"" with 59 different countries, while popular destinations like Dubai and Jamaica have already opened their doors to foreign visitors again.

If you're one of many travelers eagerly awaiting news on where you can travel to this year, here's a guide to the top destinations making plans to reopen, as well as some of those that are keeping their borders firmly closed for now.

Aruba

Aruba will slowly reopen to tourists between June 15 and July 10.

Visitors from nearby Caribbean islands Curacao and Bonaire will be permitted to enter first, followed by travelers from Canada and Europe on July 1.

Tourists from the United States will be allowed to visit from July 10.

While it was previously suggested travelers would not be required to to take a Covid-19 test on arrival or prior to traveling, it seems this is no longer the case.

Like many other destinations, Aruba is giving visitors the option to either provide a negative test result taken no more than 72 hours before their visit, or receive a test on arrival.

However, the cost of the test, which must be paid for in advance, is the responsibility of the traveler.

The island has also introduced mandatory insurance coverage, the Aruba Visitors Insurance , which will cover any expenses if visitors test positive for the virus during their trip.

Nonessential businesses including shopping malls, cinemas, beauty salons and outdoor restaurants were allowed to reopen on May 25, while the island country's 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew was completely lifted earlier this month.

Restaurants with indoor seating have now been allowed to reopen, although diners must leave before 10 p.m., along with spas, and saunas.

In addition, the department of Public Health has introduced the ""Aruba Health & Happiness Code,"" a mandatory cleaning and hygiene certification program for all businesses related to tourism in the country.

Bali

Bali has been relatively successful in containing its coronavirus outbreak, with less than 1,500 confirmed cases and, at the time of writing, a total of 11 deaths.

The Indonesian island now hopes to welcome tourists back by October, provided its infection rates stay low.

According to a statement from Ni Wayan Giri Adnyani , secretary of the ministry, Yogyakarta, situated on the island of Java, is likely to reopen first, along with the Riau islands province.

Bali's economy is hugely dependent on tourism and visitor numbers have been rising in recent years, with around 6.3 million people visiting in 2019.

""The coronavirus has collapsed the Balinese economy ... it's been a steep drop since [mid-March] when social-distancing measures were put in place,"" Mangku Nyoman Kandia, a Bali tour guide , told ABC News in April. ""No tourist, no money.""

All foreign nationals, except for diplomats, permanent residents and humanitarian workers, are currently banned from Indonesia, and anyone entering the island must undergo a swab test and provide a letter stating they are free of Covid-19.

It's unclear what the entry requirements will be if restrictions are lifted later this year, or whether Bali will accept travelers from regions badly affected by the pandemic.

However, tourism officials have been calling for a ""travel bubble"" to be implemented between Bali and Australia.

Barbados

Barbados has announced it will be reopening its borders to international travelers from July 12.

However, visitors will have to adhere to a number of strict requirements.

All tourists from ""high risk"" countries will be ""strongly encouraged"" to take a Covid-19 test at least 72 hours before departing for Barbados, according to a recent press release from the Barbados Tourist Board.

Meanwhile, those from ""low risk"" destinations can be tested a week before visiting the Caribbean island.

Visitors also need to complete an online Embarkation/Disembarkation Card (ED card), which asks a series of health questions connected to Covid-19 symptoms.

Those who don't provide a negative test result ""from an accredited or recognized laboratory"" in advance will must take one on arrival, and will be placed in quarantine ""at their own expense"" until the results come through. This is likely to take up to 48 hours.

While visiting the island, travelers must comply with local protocols, including keeping a physical distance of one-meter away from others and wearing face masks in public.

Barbados' nationwide curfew is due to be lifted on July 1 , while commercial air traffic will resume 11 days later.

UK flag carrier British Airways will restart services to Barbados on July 18, with US airline JetBlue following suit on July 25 and Virgin Atlantic on August 1.

Bermuda

Bermuda reopened its borders to international visitors on July 1, with the first commercial flight from the US arriving in the oldest self-governing British Overseas Territory on July 6.

However, travelers must take a Covid-19 test no more than five days before traveling to Bermuda and obtain a negative result, as well as complete the Bermuda travel authorization process online at least 48 hours prior to their visit.

Once they arrive, visitors must adhere to the nightly curfew, which runs from midnight to 5 .a.m, take their own temperatures twice a day and report the results via an online application.

In addition, travelers are required to take further tests at pop-up testing centers throughout the course of their trip.

""At a time when international travel is limited for many Americans, the island is a beautiful, close and comfortable option for those in need of an unforgettable escape,"" Victoria Isley, Chief Sales & Marketing Officer for the Bermuda Tourism Authority, said in a statement.

""Bermuda offers guests an accessible, safe destination with wide open spaces and pink sand beaches, clean ocean breezes and brilliant turquoise waters, plus meaningful cultural connections and fresh island fare.""

Cyprus

Cyprus is so keen to get its tourism industry back on track, officials are offering to cover the costs of any travelers who test positive for Covid-19 while on vacation in the Mediterranean island nation.

According to a letter shared with CNN, the Cypriot government will pay for lodging, as well as food, drink and medication for tourists who are taken ill with coronavirus during their visit.

The detailed plan was set out in a five-page letter issued to governments, airlines and tour operators on May 26.

Officials have also earmarked a 100-bed hospital for foreign travelers who test positive, while a 500-room ""quarantine hotel"" will be available to patients' family and ""close contacts.""

""The traveler will only need to bear the cost of their airport transfer and repatriation flight, in collaboration with their agent and/or airline,"" states the letter.

The country's hotels began to reopen on June 1, while international air travel restarted on June 9.

Once the destination reopens, visitors from only chosen countries will be allowed to enter.

Officials have issued a list of countries to be granted access to Cyprus in two separate stages.

Incoming flights from Greece, Malta, Bulgaria, Norway, Austria, Finland, Slovenia, Hungary, Israel, Denmark, Germany, Slovakia and Lithuania will be authorized first.

From June 20, Cyprus will also permit incoming flights from Switzerland, Poland, Romania, Croatia, Estonia and the Czech Republic.

The UK and the US, both listed among the nations with the highest number of confirmed Covid-19 deaths, are noticeably absent.

However, the list is to be expanded to include further countries in the coming months.

Travelers heading to Cyprus will need to provide a valid certificate proving they've tested negative for Covid-19, while they'll be subject to temperature checks on arrival as well as testing at random during the course of their trip.

The destination has already put measures in place to protect travelers and residents, such as ensuring hotel staff wear masks and gloves, regularly disinfecting sunbeds and keeping tables at restaurants, bars, cafés,and pubs at least two meters (6.5 feet) apart.

Egypt

Tourism brings in around $1 billion in revenue for Egypt each month, so the impact of the travel restrictions caused by the pandemic has been significant.

The government suspended passenger flights back in March, while all hotels, restaurants and cafes were closed and a night curfew imposed.

These measures are currently being relaxed, with hotels that meet certain requirements, such as having a clinic with a resident doctor on site, being granted permission to reopen for domestic visitors at a reduced capacity.

Although international flights are yet to begin operating again -- bar a select few routes -- the cabinet has indicated scheduled international flights will be allowed to enter from July 1 , while foreign tourists will be permitted at the resorts least affected by Covid-19.

""A number of global carriers have expressed willingness to resume flights to Egypt in July, and as a result we are considering a gradual resumption of international flights beginning towards the end of this month and in the first half of July.""

France

France was the most visited country in the world before the coronavirus pandemic.

While restrictions were previously in place on all nonessential travel from outside the Schengen Zone (a grouping of 26 countries which normally have open borders), the measures are due to be lifted for 15 countries outside of the EU, including Australia, Canada and Japan.

At present all travelers who enter France, with the exception of EU citizens, are subject to a compulsory 14-day quarantine.

UK citizens were previously exempt from this measure. However, this was recently amended in response to the UK's decision to apply its mandatory 14-day quarantine, which is set to be amended soon , to arrivals from France.

Although the government has been slowly lifting lockdown measures, with car journeys of up to 100 kilometers now allowed and beaches beginning to reopen, officials have previously made it clear the country is in no hurry to ease border restrictions for international travelers..

Prime Minister Edouard Philippe recently announced a $19.4 billion stimulus package to boost France's ailing tourism sector.

""What is good for tourism is often good for France, what strikes tourism strikes France,"" he said during a news conference.

The country's hotels, bars, restaurants and cafés were granted permission to reopen on June 2.

Meanwhile Paris was downgraded from a ""red zone"" to a ""green zone"" in mid-June and the city has now reopened.

France's most visited museum, the Louvre, will reopen on July 6.

""Tourism is facing what is probably its worst challenge in modern history,"" added Philippe. ""Because this is one of the crown jewels of the French economy, rescuing it is a national priority.""

He went on to state that residents can take holidays within France during July and August.

The country's hotels will be reliant on domestic tourism once they do reopen, as all signs suggest international travelers will not be able to enter for the foreseeable future.

""When the lockdown measures soften, French tourists are likely to want to stay close to home in the short term,"" a spokesperson for French hotel chain Accor told CNN Travel earlier this month.

""It will be the moment for them to rediscover their own country and we will be there to welcome them.""

Georgia

Georgia was experiencing a tourism boom before the coronavirus pandemic, with five million travelers visiting in 2019, a 7% increase on the previous year.

But the country was forced to close its winter resorts and place a ban on all foreign visitors back in March because of the crisis.

Eager to revive its tourism sector, the country's government had previously said it planned to reopen to international travelers on July 1, but this has been pushed back until July 31 due to a ""rapid increase in the number of new coronavirus cases in the partner and neighboring countries.""

Officials have brought in a three-stage ""anti-crisis"" plan , which includes a marketing campaign designed to promote Georgia as a ""safe destination.""

The next stage will allow for domestic travel in special ""safe"" tourism zones, while the final stage involves reopening borders and resuming some flights.

""We are transitioning to the third stage [of Covid-19 response], which means post-crisis management of the economy and devising plans [on] how to kickstart different sectors,"" Prime Minister Giorgi Gakharia said at a council meeting focused on fighting Covid-19.

""[The] tourism sector will be first to which emergency relief measures will apply.""

Germany

The land of poets and thinkers lifted travel restrictions for travelers from 31 different countries on June 15.

The approved destinations included the 26 EU member states, as well as the UK, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland.

""The revitalization of tourism is important both for travelers and the German travel industry, as well as for the economic stability of the respective target countries,"" read a statement from a paper called ""Criteria for the Enabling of intra-European Tourism,"" which was issued last month.

The Austria/Germany land border has also reopened -- travel between Austria and Germany is possible as of June 15 -- and restrictions around the country are being relaxed.

Visitors from destinations such as Australia and Canada will also be allowed to enter soon due to the EU's decision to lift restrictions on various countries outside of the bloc.

Chancellor Angela Merkel recently announced social distancing rules would continue until at least October.

Greece

International flights to Greece resumed on July 1. cunfek/Getty Images

International direct flights to Greece's many holiday destinations restarted on July 1 for travelers from most of the EU and list of 14 additional EU-approved countries , with travelers subject only to random checks.

Greece has also extended its travel ban on direct flights from the UK and Sweden until July 15. All information is expected to be updated by mid-July.

The US, Greece's third largest market, is not included on the EU list. Nearly 2 million Americans visited Greece in 2019. The country has been attracting a growing number of US travelers in recent years and was projected to grow further in 2020.

Russia also failed to make the EU list meaning that Greece will enter its peak season without the three countries that in 2019 accounted for about 20% of its tourism revenue.

Greece is also opening its international ports and some border crossings for the first time since the country imposed a strict lockdown over three months ago.

The country is being hailed as one of the safest destinations for holidaymakers in the Mediterranean this summer with under 200 deaths from Covid-19 and less than 3,500 cases in a population of 11 million.

As part of the measures to contain the spread of Covid-19, international travelers are required to fill in a detailed passenger form. The Passenger Locator Form (PLF) will have to be completed online at least 48 hours before entering the country and includes information such as duration of previous stays in other countries during the two weeks prior to travel, and the address of stay in Greece.

Travelers will receive QR codes based on an algorithm that will calculate those most at risk of spreading a coronavirus infection. Authorities will use the QR code to identify passengers who need to be tested upon arrival, Greece's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has said.

Those tested must quarantine overnight pending results. Those who test positive will be quarantined for up to 14 days.

Hungary

Travelers from outside the European Union hoping to visit Hungary this summer will have to wait a little longer.

Prime Minister Viktor Orban announced Thursday that the Central European country would only be reopening its borders to one of the 14 EU-approved ""safe"" countries in order to protect the ""health interests"" of residents.

Its southern neighbor Serbia, home to a large ethnic Hungarian minority, was the sole non-EU country to make the cut.

The decision came just days after the EU's request for its member states to lift travel restrictions for various countries outside the bloc, including China, provided it reciprocates the move, Australia and Japan.

""For the time being, with the exception of Serbia, we can't comply with the EU's request that we allow entry to citizens from outside the bloc because that would be contrary to the health interests of the Hungarian people,"" Orban said in a video posted on his Facebook page.

However, Hungary will reinstate a ""humanitarian corridor"" for travelers passing through the country, according to the prime minister.

At the time of writing, Hungary had reported over 4,000 confirmed Covid-19 cases and 587 deaths.

Although lockdown restrictions have been lifted throughout the country, wearing a face mask is mandatory while in shops and on public transport.

Iceland

Iceland reopened it borders to tourists on June 15 after recording just under 2,000 confirmed Covid-19 cases.

The move came weeks after the Nordic country banned all foreign nationals, except for nationals of the EU and associated European countries.

Up until recently, everyone arriving from outside the country was required to go into quarantine for 14 days.

However, travelers now have the option to either submit to a Covid-19 test on arrival, provide proof of a recently taken test with a negative result, or agree to a two-week quarantine.

Although the tests are currently free, a $112 charge will be implemented from July 1.

Visitors will also be encouraged to download the app Rakning C-19, designed to help trace the origin of transmissions and available in seven languages -- Icelandic, English, Polish, German, French, Spanish and Italian.

""When travelers return to Iceland we want to have all mechanisms in place to safeguard them and the progress made in controlling the pandemic,"" Thordis Kolbrun Reykfjord Gylfadottir, Minister of Tourism, Industry and Innovation said in an official statement last month.

""Iceland's strategy of large-scale testing, tracing and isolating have proven effective so far.

""We want to build on that experience of creating a safe place for those who want a change of scenery after what has been a tough spring for all of us.""

Italy

Italy has been one of the destinations worst hit by the pandemic, but the hugely popular European country is keen to get its tourism industry up and running now that infection rates have slowed down.

Travelers from the EU, along with the UK and the microstates and principalities of Andorra, Monaco, San Marino and the Vatican, were allowed to enter without having to go into quarantine starting June 3, in a move the government has described as a ""calculated risk.""

""We're facing a calculated risk in the knowledge that the contagion curve may rise again,"" Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said in a televised address to the nation earlier this month.

""We have to accept it; otherwise, we will never be able to start up again.""

However, Italy, has also indicated it will not be complying with the EU's request to lift travel restrictions for 14 countries outside the bloc.

A mandatory quarantine remains in place for all other nations and it seems officials are not planning to lift this any time soon.

""The situation on a global level remains very complex,"" Italy's health minister Roberto Speranza told Italian news agency ANSA shortly after the announcement was made on Tuesday.

""We must not allow the sacrifices of Italians in recent months being made in vain.""

All museums, including Rome's Vatican Museums , have been slowly reopening throughout May with strict social-distancing rules. Bars and restaurants were permitted to reopen with reduced numbers of diners as well as plastic shields to divide customers, on May 18.

St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican also opened its doors again on May 18 after being closed for over two months, the Leaning Tower of Pisa has reopened, while the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express is scheduled to return to railways on July 8.

Jamaica

Jamaica reopened to international tourists on June 15, nearly three months after closing its borders.

Up until the end of June, travelers heading to the Caribbean island will be required to complete a travel authorization form within 72 hours of departure and be willing to undergo a test for Covid-19 on arrival.

A ""resilient corridor"" has also been introduced, limiting the movement of visitors to a section of Jamaica's northern coast between Negril and Port Antonio.

Hotels and businesses within this area are allowed to reopen provided they have received a ""Covid-19 Readiness Certificate"".

Visitors will also be required to adhere to local protocols, such as wearing face masks or coverings in public and social distancing.

""Tourism is the lifeblood of our local economy, and with the help of international experts and a dedicated task force, we have developed protocols that allow us to safely reopen our borders,"" Jamaica's Director of Tourism Donovan White said in a statement.

""We are confident that as we restart our economy, Jamaicans will work together to ensure a safe, secure and seamless experience for our tourism workers, their families, and visitors, while preserving the authentic experiences travelers seek when they visit our shores.""

Jamaica welcomes over 4.3 million visitors each year, with tourism accounting for 34% of its GDP.

The Maldives

The Maldives closed its national borders and canceled all flights shortly after recording its first two coronavirus cases in March.

However, around 30 resorts here have stayed open , with tourists opting to self-isolate in the famous honeymoon destination rather than return home.

The island nation, which is made up of over 1,000 islands, has recorded around 1,457 confirmed cases and five deaths from Covid-19 so far.

While it was previously thought the destination would reopen at the end of the year, officials have brought this forward to July.

A spokesperson for the tourism board has confirmed the Maldives will be open to tourists of all nationalities from July.

While a previous draft proposal indicated travelers would need to present a medical certificate confirming proof of a negative Covid-19 test, the new plans will see visitors allowed to enter the country without prior testing or a mandatory quarantine period.

There are also no new visa requirements or additional fees.

""We are planning to reopen our borders for visitors in July, 2020,"" reads an official statement issued by the Ministry of Tourism on May 30.

""We also want to assure our guests that they will not be charged any additional fees to enter the Maldives.""

The government is also considering issuing a ""Safe Tourism License"" for tourist facilities that comply with government legislation and certain safety requirements, such as having a certified medic readily available and holding an ""adequate stock"" of PPE equipment.

But the destination's tourism board has confirmed that visitors will not have to commit to spending a minimum of 14 days in the country, as was previously suggested, nor will they need to have a confirmed booking with a tourist facility with a ""Safe Tourism License.""

The Maldives received more than 1.7 million visitors in 2019 and the destination had expected numbers to rise to two million in 2020.

Malta

Shortly after Malta registered its first Covid-19 case in March, a mandatory 14-day self-quarantine was put in place for all tourists entering the small Mediterranean country.

Outbound flights to France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Switzerland were then suspended, before all flight departures and arrivals were banned on March 20.

Prime Minister Robert Abela recently confirmed Malta will be reopening its borders to visitors from at least 17 countries on July 1.

Travelers from Germany, Austria, Cyprus, Switzerland, Iceland, Slovakia, Norway, Denmark, Hungary, Finland, Ireland, Lithuania, Israel, Latvia, Estonia, Luxembourg, and the Czech Republic will all be permitted to enter without going into self-isolation for two weeks.

The destinations chosen are those apparently deemed ""safe"" by the Malta Tourism Authority with regards to Covid-19 transmission.

However, restrictions on all other flight destinations will be lifted from July 15, according to officials.

Mexico

Mexico is aiming to welcome visitors back within weeks.

While the nation remains in lockdown, with hotels and restaurants yet to recommence business, officials are planning to reopen the country bit by bit in order to get things back on track.

""The plan for the country is to open in stages and by regions,"" WTTC CEO Gloria Guevara told CNN Travel recently.

""The target is domestic travelers first, followed by travelers from the US and Canada and then the rest of the world.

However, the border between the US and Mexico border will remain closed to ""nonessential"" travel until July 21, according to a statement from the US Department of Homeland Security on June 16.

The restrictions were first announced in mid-March.

While most international flights in and out of Mexico's key airports are currently suspended or significantly reduced, Delta Air Lines will be increasing and/or resuming various services from the US to Cancun, Mexico City Los Cabos and Puerta Vallarta in the coming weeks.

Quintana Roo, a state on the Caribbean side of Mexico that's home to the likes of Cancun, Playa del Carmen and Tulum, hopes to reopen in mid-June, according to Marisol Vanegas, the state's tourism secretary.

""We want to revive tourism and expect to start opening sights and hotels sometime between June 10 and 15 but don't know which ones yet,"" she says.

""It depends on what the federal government allows us to do.""

Meanwhile, Los Cabos will kick off a five-phase plan to revive tourism in June.

Rodrigo Esponda, managing director of the Los Cabos Tourism Board, says he hopes to be able to accept both international and domestic travelers by August and September.

However, beach destination Riviera Nayarit, situated north of Puerta Vallarta, currently has no immediate plans to bring back tourists, according to Richard Zarkin, the public relations manager for the Riviera Nayarit Convention and Visitors Bureau.

Portugal

Portugal is keen to revive its struggling tourism industry, with Foreign Minister Augusto Santos Silva recently declaring ""tourists are welcome.""

Incoming flights from outside the EU are now slowly starting up again, with TAP Air Portugal, Portugal's national airline , resuming its nonstop flight between Lisbon and Newark airport earlier this month.

Travelers from EU nations, apart from Italy and Spain, are now permitted to enter the country without going into quarantine.

However, temperature checks will be taken on arrival and visitors will need to comply with local social distancing measures.

The land border between Portugal and Spain, which has been closed to tourists since March, is unlikely to reopen until at least July 1.

""We are gradually going to start looking at easing border controls,"" Internal Affairs Minister Eduardo Cabrita said earlier this month.

In May, officials began putting measures in place to ensure foreign travelers would feel confident to return to Portugal.

Rita Marques, the country's Secretary of State for Tourism, has launched a ""don't cancel, postpone"" scheme, allowing tourists to reschedule any pre-arranged holidays to Portugal until the close of 2021.

This is valid for all bookings made through accredited travel agencies, along with hotels or Airbnbs, for trips scheduled between March 13 and September 30, 2020.

In addition, national tourism authority Turismo de Portugal has created a free hygiene-certification stamp to distinguish ""Clean & Safe"" tourism enterprises to increase visitors' confidence.

Businesses will have to comply with hygiene and cleaning requirements for the prevention and control of Covid-19 to receive the stamp, which is valid for one year.

According to Santos Silva, Portugal's airports will soon be introducing health checks for arrivals, but visitors will not be subject to a mandatory quarantine

Spain

Spain's lockdown was one of the toughest in Europe, but restrictions have gently been lifted.

Beaches reopened in June while hotels in some parts of the country have also been permitted to resume business.

Now the European destination, which welcomed a record 84 million visitors in 2019, has moved forward its reopening date, granting EU travelers permission to enter without having to quarantine for two weeks from June 21.

While there's been little mention of opening borders to travelers beyond the EU, it's thought Spain is hoping to follow the lead of destinations such as Lithuania and the Czech Republic by establishing safe corridors, or a ""travel bubble,"" with nearby destinations that have managed to keep the outbreak under control.

""We have to guarantee, when international tourism opens, that the person who comes to Spain is a safe person,"" Spanish Tourism Minister Reyes Maroto recently told local newspaper El Pais.

""The issue of borders will be accompanied by the evolution of the health crisis.""

As part of the European Union, Spain will also be open to the 15 countries the EU is lifting its external border to.

At present, it's mandatory for anyone six and older to wear face masks while in public, both indoors and outdoors, ""where it is not possible to maintain [an interpersonal] distance.""

St. Lucia is one of several Caribbean islands trying for a tourism comeback.

The tropical destination, which closed its orders to foreign travelers on March 23, began its phased reopening on June 4, when it lifted its borders to visitors from the United States.

Those traveling to the country must present ""certified proof"" of a negative Covid-19 test taken within 48 hours of boarding their flight.

Visitors will also be subject to screening and temperature checks by port health authorities and must wear face masks and maintain social distancing during their visit.

Officials are also bringing in new safety measures for taxis to separate drivers and passengers.

""Our new protocols have been carefully crafted and will build confidence among travelers and our citizens,"" Minister of Tourism Dominic Fedee said in a statement.

""The government of Saint Lucia remains resolved to protect both lives and livelihoods as it jump starts its economy.""

Local businesses have also been allowed to reopen, provided they have appropriate cleaning measures and social distancing measures in place.

Details of the second phase of the island's reopening, which is to begin on August 1, will be announced in the coming weeks.

Thailand

Thailand has long been among the top destinations for travelers, receiving close to 40 million foreign tourists last year.

However, visitors have been banned from entering the Southeast Asian country since March because of the pandemic.

While the number of cases here has been relatively low in comparison to other destinations -- Thailand has reported more than 3,000 confirmed cases and over 50 deaths -- officials aren't taking any chances when it comes to reopening the country.

""It is still dependent on the outbreak situation, but I think the earliest we may see the return of tourists could be the fourth quarter of this year,"" Yuthasak Supasorn, governor of the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) told CNN Travel.

The governor went on to stress there will be limitations on who can visit the country and what regions they can go to once restrictions are relaxed.

""We are not going to open all at once,"" he added. ""We are still on high alert, we just can't let our guards down yet.

""We have to look at the country of origin [of the travelers] to see if their situation has truly improved.""

This effectively means Thailand is unlikely to open its borders to travelers from destinations that don't appear to have the coronavirus situation under control.

Those that are given permission to enter may be offered ""long-stay packages"" in isolated areas ""where health monitoring can be easily controlled,"" such as the remote islands of Koh Pha Ngan and Koh Samui.

On July 1, a ban on international flights was lifted by The Civil Aviation Authority of Thailand (CAAT) provided certain conditions are met

Business travelers and those seeking medical treatment in Thailand are among those now permitted to enter the country.

The lack of foreign tourists means that visitor numbers will drop to 14 to 16 million this year, according to TAT.

But like many other global destinations, Thailand has been focusing on domestic tourism.

In fact, some resorts and hotels have already been given the go ahead to reopen -- Hua Hin, located about 200 kilometers (124 miles) south of Bangkok, being one of them.

Shopping malls, museums, markets and some tourist attractions have also been reopening their doors, with Bangkok's Grand Palace resuming business on June 4.

Turkey

Turkey made over $34.5 billion from tourism in 2019, and the transcontinental country was eager to get back in business.

Like many other countries, the popular destination opted to restart domestic tourism before beginning to welcome foreign visitors.

International flights routes to and from Turkey have been gradually restarting throughout June, with the UK, Germany, Austria, Croatia, Hong Kong and Switzerland among the 40 nations Turkey is now receiving travelers from.

While tourists are not required to undergo Covid-19 tests before their trip, all visitors will receive a medical evaluation, including temperature checks, on arrival.

""When foreign visitors come, they will be health-checked, and body temperatures will be measured. If there is a suspicion, tourists will be taken for a PCR test.

""These measurements will start in Antalya, Bodrum, Dalaman, Izmir, Istanbul airports, the country's provinces with the most tourist attraction,"" Mehmet Nuri Ersoy, Minister of Culture and Tourism for Turkey, said earlier this month

The country has also set out new guidelines for its hotels and resort facilities, such as temperature checks at entrances and at least 12 hours of room ventilation after checkout. Guests will be required to wear face masks and maintain social distancing.

""The more transparent and detailed information we give, the more we will earn the confidence of tourists,"" Ersoy previously said while revealing plans to open around half of Turkey's hotels this year.

Meanwhile, restrictions on intercity travel have been lifted, while restaurants, cafes, parks and sports facilities are permitted to reopen from June 1, along with beaches and museums.

When the UAE, which is made up of seven emirates, closed its borders in March, the stringent restrictions included withdrawing tourist visas and banning all outgoing flights.

But the Emirati authorities have been gradually scaling down these restrictions over the past few weeks.

On July 7, Dubai finally reopened to international visitors. But there are a number of new protocols in place.

Tourists are required to take a Covid-19 test within four days of departure (96 hours). Those who are unable to provide proof of this on arrival will be tested at the airport.

Visitors are also required to fill out a health declaration before their visit and show they have adequate health insurance.

On entering Dubai, all travelers must download the Dubai Covid-19 DXB contact tracing app and register their details. Its public beaches, parks and water parks have all resumed business -- under strict social distancing guidelines.

At hotels, guests are required to wear masks at all times and can only check in to rooms 24 hours after the previous guest has checked out

The emirate of Abu Dhabi remains closed to travelers at present.

United Kingdom

When other destinations were relaxing travel restrictions and bringing in measures to lure travelers back, the UK opted to enact stricter regulations.

However, the government has chosen to relax quarantine rules for travelers from a number of destinations, including France, Italy and Spain.

From July 10, travelers in England from 58 selected countries will no longer have to self-isolate for 14 days.

The US, Portugal and China are among the destinations that aren't on the list, which is ""under constant review.""

Although the same applies to tourists visiting Wales and Northern Ireland, Scotland has issued its own separate list of 39 countries, which Spain is notably absent from.

""Whether you are a holidaymaker ready to travel abroad or a business eager to open your doors again, this is good news for British people and great news for British businesses,"" Grant Shapps, UK secretary of state for transport, said in a statement last week.

""The entire nation has worked tirelessly to get to this stage, therefore safety must remain our watch word and we will not hesitate to move quickly to protect ourselves if infection rates rise in countries we are reconnecting with

The changes will come as a welcome move for those frustrated by the UK's mandatory two-week quarantine , which came into effect on June 8.

Paul Charles, a member of Quash Quarantine, a campaign group lobbying the government to drop the quarantine, previously described the guidelines as ""unworkable and unenforceable.""

""A lot of jobs have gone in the last few weeks as people haven't been able to book holidays because they've been fearful of quarantine,"" Charles told CNN Travel last month.

""So, quarantine itself has acted as a block to future bookings.""

The approved destinations pose ""a reduced risk to the public health of UK citizens,"" according to the UK Department for Transport.

Justin Solomon,"World's cheapest draft? Where to try bia hoi, Hanoi's 25 cent beer","(CNN) — As soon as the sun sets in Hanoi , Vietnam , there's only one place to be: the corner of Ta Hien and Luong Ngoc Quyen streets.

Known as ""Beer Corner"", this famous intersection in the Old Quarter lures travelers and residents alike to socialize over ice-cold bia hoi (light Vietnamese draft beer) atop tiny plastic stools.

A visit to Beer Corner isn't just about enjoying a few brews -- it's also a window into the history of the city.

""If you really want to get up close and personal with the culture of a new city, in particular the culture of the local people, you need to stroll the sidewalks, sit on a stool and have a nice cold beer,"" Brett MacDouall, co-founder of Hanoi Beer Tour , tells CNN Travel.

""And that's what I love about Ta Hien Street.""

Bonding over beer

It's on Ta Hien Street where MacDouall and co-founder Tan Vu met for the first time in 2005.

While chatting over beer, the two men discovered their fathers both fought in the Vietnam War, albeit on opposing sides.

""So here were two boys, both born in 1974 who grew up in the 1980s,"" says MacDouall. ""I suppose you could say, ideologically, we were very opposed.""

""But the first time we sat down over a cold beer and spoke to one another, we realized that our family values were very similar and have become the best of friends.""

Today, the two men aren't just best buds -- they're also business partners, traipsing around the city with travelers to explore and share the city's stories of beer.

Bia hoi basics

The first brewery in Hanoi opened in the 1890s, when the French controlled the city.

""The French brought the beer drinking culture to Vietnam,"" says MacDouall. ""Before that, [people drank] rice wine.""

After the Hanoi beer brewing factory was set up, beer culture caught on quickly.

Today, Vietnam is one Asia's biggest beer-drinking nations, consuming 3.8 billion liters a year in 2016, according to Ministry of Industry and Trade.

""It evolved through workers [who enjoyed beer] after a hard day's work,"" says MacDouall. ""It was also curiosity -- people wanted to see what Westerners were drinking.""

At the time, however, the beer was expensive, marketed to the city's upper crust.

It wasn't until the late 1950s that bia hoi was introduced as an affordable options for everyday citizens. A brewery opened on Ta Hien Street, selling the fresh lager at just a few cents a mug.

This local staple is a light and refreshing lager, with an alcohol content of less than 3%.

The idea? You can drink it for long sessions to cool off after working all day in Hanoi's sweltering temperatures.

""Some will actually say it is 'instant beer' like instant noodles, since it is made quickly and sold quickly,"" explains MacDouall.

""The alcohol content is low and that was because people wanted to consume it rapidly.""

Over the years, countless bars and restaurants have populated Ta Hien Street, bring with them swathes of tiny stools and metal tables that flank both sides of the sidewalk.

All new brews

Still today, bia hoi is relatively affordable when compared with international labels. A glass of the light lager could set you back anywhere from 15 to 40 US cents.

But that's slowly changing.

""For local owners, selling bia hoi doesn't create enough money to sustain the business,"" says MacDouall.

""So they would rather sell bottled beer and focus on food. But if you still want bia hoi, this is where you come and get it.""

And if you want something other than lager?

Enthusiasts can easily track down local microbreweries and craft beer bars that pour more creative concoctions.

Furbrew , on the banks of West Lake, for example, serves a 'pho' beer that mimics the flavors of the famous dish with a malty, herby, slightly spicy recipe.

Dan Tham,Preserving Macao's handmade signs in the digital age,"Written by Dan Tham, CNN Macao

Perched on a stool in his dusty workshop in Macao, Lam Weng Io looks like a scholar or a librarian, bespectacled and in deep concentration.

With steady hands, he carefully guides a sheet of red acrylic through a cutting machine.

For more than 30 years, Lam has been creating handwritten storefront signs in the former Portuguese colony as a full-time typographer. In each of his characters, Lam aims for a trifecta of balance, clarity and liveliness.

Hundreds of the 65-year-old's signs can be seen all over Macao, a special administrative region that was handed back to China in 1999 after centuries of Portuguese rule.

They're written in traditional Chinese characters -- which are more complicated and contain more strokes -- as opposed to the simplified Chinese characters that were adopted by the mainland in the 1950s, when Macao was still a European colony.

Adorning the entrance to Lam's workshop-cum-abode are bright red letters, wishing good fortune in the Year of the Pig. As he works, wall of white paper scrolls covered with Chinese poems and aphorisms flutter in the breeze.

The machine hums and slices. Lam shifts the sheet this way and that.

After a few minutes of intense focus, Lam frees a word from an acrylic sheet. He holds it up to light, inspects the grooves.

""門."" Chinese for ""gate.""

Photographed above is a Chinese character for ""gate."" Credit: CNN

While this particularly character is usually written as two nonadjacent radicals that look like saloon doors from a Western movie, Lam's 門 comes out in one piece, with the stylized flourishes of a brushstroke.

Lam says he was noticed for his penmanship from an early age.

""I've always been interested in Chinese characters,"" Lam says. ""When I was a student, other classmates would ask me to write characters for them, because they liked the look of my handwriting. When I got older, people told me that I should open my own business.""

Lam's signs advertise doctors' offices and grocery stores, real estate agencies and apartment buildings.

But Lam says business has been slow lately, because shopkeepers across Macao are opting for cheaper, digitally-produced signs over his traditional ones.

""In the digital age, many people don't need you to write for them,"" Lam says. ""I've received fewer customers.""

But technology hasn't spelled total doom for Lam's typography business. In 2014, a chance meeting led Lam to local typeface designer, Benny Tang Pou I, a long-time fan of his work. Tang's award-winning work includes fonts that emulate birds in flight and the cobblestoned streets of Macao.

Tang says he was struck by the beauty of the signs produced by Lam. Together, the two decided to digitize Lam's handwriting, with every stroke in every character replicated on Tang's computer and immortalized as a typeface.

""I would say that handwritten signs, like Mr. Lam's, convey more emotion and humanness,"" the 38-year-old says. ""A digitally-produced sign feels lifeless.""

Tang says he was struck by the beauty of the signs produced by Lam. Credit: Dan Tham/CNN

Tang scans the characters onto his computer and then adjusts the shape of the strokes to create more uniformity. So far, he's digitized around 300 of Lam's Chinese characters, a process that took six months. He aims to convert up to 13,000 by the end of the project, which could take more than five years.

On a stroll near the Ruins of St. Paul's, Lam and Tang point out the signage that carries Lam's trademark style. Pausing in front of a barber shop, the two are greeted by the storeowner. They explain that Lam had written his storefront sign. The three men step back and admire his handiwork.

For Tang, these kinds of traditional signs do more than convey information to passersby. They can help to define a city's aesthetic and cultural identity.

""Certain things here (in Macao) are slowly fading away,"" Tang says, ""Like Mr. Lam's signs. If we don't take action to preserve his font now, there might not be an opportunity in the future.""",2020-07-12,https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/artisans-macao-typography-signs/index.html
Zahra Jamshed,"'Like the tart, I never change': The secret behind Macao's most famous dessert","Macao (CNN) — You can smell it before you see it. The sweet smell of sugar, egg and custard, baking til it's cooked just right. Flaky pastry on the outside, soft custard on the inside, and crispy, burnt, sugar on top.

It's the signature smell of Margaret's Café e Nata -- one of the most popular places to eat in Macao, a former Portuguese colony.

The cafe is especially famous for one thing: the Macanese egg tart. It's a sweet pastry inspired by its Portuguese and Chinese counterparts, made fresh daily by owner Margaret Wong.

If visitors aren't there for a treat from the bakery, chances are they're there to see Wong.

After three decades in the food business, she's a colorful personality who still spends every day working hard at the cafe. She can be spotted working the cash register or bustling about in the kitchen.

Few people know Macanese egg tarts better than Wong, who began making the dish 30 years ago with her late ex-husband Andrew Stow.

The couple founded their first bakery business, Lord Stow's, in 1989. Today, Lord Stow's is run by their daughter Audrey and Andrew's sister Eileen.

Margaret's Café e Nata, which she subsequently founded in 1992, is entirely run by Wong herself.

Some online reports suggest that Wong founded her cafe to compete with Lord Stow's -- which netizens claim was born as a result of a domestic feud following the couple's divorce.

She wouldn't comment on the rumors, though she spoke openly about the early days of their romance.

""We were married three times -- once in Hong Kong, once in England and once in a church,"" she says.

According to Wong, the couple met in a local church, where she played the organ.

""One day my foster mother was visiting from America, and we bumped into Andrew, who gave me a hug and a kiss and I went all red. He was friends with everybody so I didn't think I was anything special ... but my mother said 'Margaret, I think this is the right one for you.'""

The two were married in 1988.

Up to 10,000 tarts a day

Together, the couple created their signature egg tart dish, which is now an iconic Macao dish. Purists argue this egg tart tastes nothing like its Portuguese or Chinese counterparts.

According to Wong, that's the point.

""When we started our bakery, someone asked Andrew to make a pasteis de nata, because they were very popular in Portugal. The first tray came out burnt and wrong, and Andrew wanted to throw them away. I said, hold on, they're edible, so let people just try them. They tried one, and then two, and by the third I said, 'I have to charge you because clearly, it's good!' ""

It's this same recipe, three decades later, that continues to be sold across Macao.

Today, hundreds of tourists and locals alike line up at her cafe for a bite of this now famous pastry.

Wong's cafe alone can make up to 10,000 tarts a day -- all of which are bound to sell out.

""Sometimes people walk in and say -- can I have just one egg tart -- and I say, not even one bite.""

Every single dish sold by the bakery is graced with Wong's magic touch. In addition to egg tarts, other items on the menu include brownies, cakes and croissants. There's also a salad and sandwich bar.

Despite long working hours, and the physically demanding nature of her work, she still spends almost every day bouncing back and forth between the kitchen and the shop.

""Some of my staff have been working with me for 15 years, they know everything, but still sometimes I have to make sure everything is good -- I'm the boss!"" she says.

Dean Irvine,Tokyo transformed: Global sporting events put spotlight on Japan's capital,"(CNN) — With Tokyo set to host two of the world's biggest sporting events -- the Rugby World Cup and the 2020 Summer Olympics -- Japan's capital is making final preparations for the global spotlight.

So what will sports fans notice when they travel here?

First of all, they won't be alone.

Tourism in Tokyo is already booming. Annual foreign visitor arrivals to Japan trebled in the years from 2013 to 2018 to over 31 million, with around 10 million stopping in Tokyo. That's supposed to top 40 million in 2020.

However, unlike other destinations in Japan that are visibly struggling to cope with the influx, Tokyo, thanks to its size and a series of measures to prepare for the deluge, has so far been able to absorb them.

Rugby World Cup kicks off this week

The city's Olympic readiness will get a test run when the Rugby World Cup kicks off on September 20 at Tokyo Stadium. Matches will be held in 12 Japanese cities and around 600,000 international rugby fans are expected to descend on the country, taking one third of tickets.

Most of those will be from rugby heartlands: the British Isles, France, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. The organizers have promised that all the basics for an exciting and welcoming experience are in place, with 13,000 volunteers, many with English-language skills, on hand on match days.

Tokyo Stadium itself is around 18 kilometers to the west of what can be considered the central part of the city, though there are two official fan zones at the Tokyo Sports Square and Chofu Station Square/Chofu City Green Hall.

Unless Japan is playing, local pubs, known as izakayas, are more likely to be watching the culmination of the baseball season or variety shows on TV than rugby.

This is where some businesses are looking to fill the gap, such as the Hub group of British-style pubs and ANA Intercontinental Hotel Group.

Both are making efforts to target foreign visitors and local sports fans with promotions and fan-theme areas in their bars and hotels to watch live broadcasts of the matches.

""What I most expect is that we will have many foreigners who understand pub culture (because it's originally their culture) and they enjoy chatting and watching sports,"" says Tsuyoshi Ota, president of Hub.

While the sport is growing in the country and Japan's national team, known as ""The Brave Blossoms"" notched a huge win in the tournament against South African four years ago, it still remains niche.

""I think locals will find something big is going on in September seeing so many foreigners and they will give foreigners a warm greeting. I don't think most local people realize that so many people are coming to Japan for the Rugby World Cup,"" says Ota.

Tokoyite and sports fan Kensuke Tezuka also thinks that once the event gets going the atmosphere and local interest level will change.

""Japanese people tend to be quiet in daily life but we get cheerful and friendly in omatsuri (festival) occasions. I remember the 2002 football World Cup. Shibuya Crossing was very lively. The visitors come to Tokyo for a once-in a-lifetime occasion, so they are naturally excited. They will provide a great vibe.""

The 'Olympics effect'

l e v a r t

Japan's government expects the ""Olympics effect"" will bring approximately an extra 10 million visitors to the country in 2020.

It's an opportunity to showcase Tokyo to the world and the country isn't taking it lightly. Earlier this year, the city's governor, Yuriko Koike, told media the city was poised for ""dramatic change.""

""This year, 2019, will be key in making those Games a success and ushering in a new Tokyo,"" said Koike.

Major developments now underway include the Takanawa Gateway -- the first new station build on Tokyo's key JR Yamanote train line since 1971 -- which is due to open next year.

Featuring a steel-and-glass roof inspired by traditional Japanese origami, it's located between Tamachi and Shinagawa Stations and was designed by architect Kengo Kuma, who is also behind the new National Stadium being built for the 2020 Tokyo Games.

The area around Shibuya Station is also being revamped as part of a huge multi-year makeover to cement it as the city's entertainment, transport and business hub for decades to come.

This includes the new Shibuya Scramble Square, a 230-meter high mixed-use skyscraper located directly above Shibuya Station, with indoor and outdoor observation decks. It's due to open for business November 1.

Another hotly anticipated opening in this neighborhood is the Meiji Jingu Museum -- also by Kengo Kuma. Due to open in late October, it sits next to Yoyogi Park and is designed to blend into its wooded surroundings while showcasing important cultural artifacts.

Other changes of note include wider free wifi coverage not just in Tokyo but in the entire country -- including 108 Shinkansen ""bullet train"" stations.

To assist with language barriers while dining, the Tokyo government has launched a special location-based website that highlights restaurants with multilingual menus.

New Olympics sporting venues

In terms of Olympic sporting action, 30 events will be taking place at 43 venues, with the soon-to-be-finished New National Stadium as the centerpiece.

Located on the site of the main stadium for the 1964 Olympics, it's just a few kilometers from areas of the city popular with foreign visitors such as Shibuya, Shinjuku, Ginza and Roppongi.

On top of that, 10 public locations including Yoyogi and Hibiya parks will broadcast events, while a cohort of 80,000 volunteers -- many of them English-speaking -- will guide visitors, meaning the city should be well prepared.

Visiting sports fans with tickets will also find themselves near Tokyo Bay. It's not a traditional tourist area, but one developed for the Olympics and Paralympics.

It will host 17 sporting venues and the Olympic Village, where humanoid robots will reportedly be available to offer directions to nearby accommodations and attractions.

Book those hotel rooms now

According to real estate services company CBRE, an additional 30,000 hotel rooms are predicted to be available in Tokyo by 2020, compared to 2017, bringing the total to around 120,000.

Among the most anticipated is the Okura Tokyo, which has just reopened following extensive renovations that kicked off in 2015.

The original Hotel Okura Tokyo main building opened in 1962 and quickly became a global favorite by offering a mix of traditional Japanese culture with world-class service. After four years of rebuilding work, it has reopened as the Okura Tokyo and offers 508 luxury rooms in two buildings.

However, many more rooms are expected to be needed to cope with the influx of Olympic visitors.

Stricter requirements on locals looking rent spare rooms in their homes, through sites such as Airbnb, and few budget hotel options in the city means that planning and booking as far in advance as possible is strongly advised.

Other stresses are predicted, both for visitors and locals.

While most signage in stations and on public transport in the capital is already in Japanese and English, the influx will put more pressure on the city's infrastructure, particularly the full-to-bursting Metro and other train lines, which visitors will be using just like the city's commuters.

But counter measures are being planned so Olympic spectators and 'salary men' and 'office ladies' don't make each other's journey even more of a squeeze.

For instance, one initiative underway is encouraging businesses to allow shift- and tele-working by its employees -- a concept still hard to digest in Japan's rigid work culture where employees works some of the longest hours in the world.

Kate Springer,The story behind Vietnam's 'Crazy House',"(CNN) — Wild, weird, wonderful... there are many ways to describe the Crazy House (also known as Hang Nga Guesthouse) in Dalat, a relaxed mountain resort town in southern Vietnam

One thing's for sure: This ""crazy"" complex is one of a kind.

Standing in stark contrast to Dalat's French colonial villas, the bizarre avant garde guesthouse is a maze of spiral staircases, sculptural bedrooms, undulating surfaces, swirls of bright colors, narrow bridges and hidden nooks.

The artist behind the structure, 79-year-old Dang Viet Nga, says it's the ultimate expression of her imagination.

""Crazy House is a culmination of my life and creativity -- it all came together in this structure,"" Dang, daughter of Vietnam's former general secretary Truong Chinh, tells CNN Travel

""I wanted to create something original, pioneering -- different from anything else in the world.""

An exercise in creativity

After earning a PhD in architecture in Moscow, Dang worked for several years in Russia then moved to Hanoi, where she worked on government projects.

On a business trip to Dalat, Dang says she fell in love with the lush landscape, cooler climate and kind people and hoped to eventually move there.

In 1983, she relocated to Dalat with her then 8-year-old son, Nguyen Viet Thang.

After years of working on state-owned developments, which afforded little creativity, she felt compelled to unleash her imagination.

In February 1990, she drew up plans for Crazy House. But instead of blueprints, she created a series of paintings to communicate her fantastical vision.

As a form of expressionist architecture, the house has no right angles but rather organic forms that are designed to mirror natural elements, like mushrooms, shells, caves and spiderwebs.

Dang Viet Nga, artist “Crazy House will never really be finished. It's like a living thing. It is always changing.”

""With this form, you have to try to free your mind,"" she says. ""There are no rules -- aside from basic structural principles [to make sure it's safe and stable] -- it's all about self-expression.""

When it came time to construct the house, Dang used various types of materials, including steel, wood and concrete.

""My mother used a lot of concrete because it's inexpensive and very easy to play with,"" says her son Nguyen, who is now 44.

""Since she can create whatever shape she wants, it reflects what she is envisioning in her mind.""

Less than a year later, the guesthouse was open for business and welcoming its first guests.

Closer to nature

Today, Crazy House feels like woodland fantasy brought to life.

""I felt that, over the last century, people have really destroyed nature. Not just in Vietnam, but around the world,"" says Dang. ""So I wanted to create a structure that brings people closer to nature.""

An elevated main house, which looks like it belongs in Hansel and Gretel, sits in the center of an open courtyard, surrounded by four enormous tree houses.

The Crazy House has been welcoming guests since 1991. Courtesy Crazy House

Sinuous cement ""branches,"" which double as bridges, twist and wind between the various houses so people can move from one to the next.

At first glance, the surreal structures recall mind-bending scenes from a Salvador Dali painting or perhaps even the organic works of modernist Catalan architect Antoni Gaudi.

The playful style continues within the tree houses, where 10 guest rooms -- each named after an animal or type of plant -- are full of organic shapes, cavern-like beds, and wooden seating areas.

""Reconnecting nature is one message that I want to communicate with the house,"" says Dang.

""But it's also a message to others to think outside of the box. Don't limit yourself by the rules and the expectations -- free your mind and let your imagination run wild.""

Following her own advice, Dang is continues to dream up new additions to the property while Nguyen now manages the business.

She is currently dreaming up two new gardens -- a Land Garden and a Sky Garden -- to add more greenery and flowers, as well as another tree house.

""I would say that Crazy House will never really be finished,"" says Nguyen. ""It's like a living thing. It is always changing.""

How to visit

In addition to staying in one of Crazy House's guest rooms, visitors can also tour the Dalat attraction for a fee. Though there's no restaurant, visitors can purchase drinks and snacks at a stall in the garden.",2020-07-12,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/crazy-house-dalat-vietnam/index.html
Rishi Iyengar,"My parents gave up their American Dream and moved back to India. 25 years later, I asked them why","(CNN) Whenever I write about President Donald Trump's efforts to crack down on work visas, more than a dozen times since I started working at CNN in 2016, I call my parents afterward and thank them for the kind of life they have given me — one full of the opportunities many immigrants now fear losing at the stroke of a pen.

My dad, Partha, moved to the United States in the early 1980s to study; my mom, Jhumkee, followed soon after. They ended up staying for more than a decade before uprooting the family and moving back to India when I was four. My sister and I grew up in their hometown of Pune with US passports and came back every summer, enjoying, as the cliché goes, ""the best of both worlds"" and an extraordinary level of privilege.

I made the customary thank-you call again last month after Trump's executive order suspending several work visas for the rest of this year, including the H-1B that allowed my parents to build a life in America nearly three decades ago.

The H-1B visa was created for ""specialty occupation"" workers as part of the Immigration Act of 1990 , a law that provided the framework for today's legal immigration system. It's one of the most popular work visas, with tens of thousands of workers using it to come into the US each year — more than half of them Indians. But the Trump administration has repeatedly targeted the program, accusing companies of using it to bring cheap foreign workers to replace Americans and enacting a series of restrictions that have created a climate of fear and uncertainty for many immigrants.

So when I called my parents this time, I decided to also interview them — about their pursuit of the American Dream, their decision to give it all up, whether they had any regrets, and how their experience can help to understand this moment of tremendous turmoil for immigrants.

America: A land of opportunity, and 'computers'

Unilever UL My father ended up in the US by process of elimination. He dreamed of being a pilot in the Indian Air Force but didn't make the cut. He then went to college, got a degree in engineering, and made it to the final interview round for Hindustan Lever (now Hindustan Unilever) — the Indian subsidiary of global consumer brand— along with four other candidates.

""If I had got the Hindustan Lever job I probably would not have come to the US,"" he said.

The company hired three of the final five candidates. He wasn't one of them. He also didn't get into any of the top Indian business schools. But at one of those school interviews in 1980, he ran into an acquaintance who was visiting from the US and told my dad he should think about getting into this ""up and coming"" field called computers.

""This friend asked: 'Oh are you interested in hardware or software?'"" my dad recalled. ""I had no clue what he was talking about, what hardware is and what software is, so I said 'Both! I want to do both!' I was that clueless.""

My father at his graduation at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1986.

That's how, in 1982, my dad entered the alphabet soup that is the US immigration system. He came to the US on an F-1 student visa, pursuing degrees at two schools that offered him financial aid, before returning to India to get married. My mom joined him in the US in 1985 on an F-2 dependent visa.

""I was very excited,"" she said. ""It was my first time going out of the country.""

But there were also profound moments of homesickness in those early years. ""Your dad had to completely stop listening to Hindi songs, poor thing, because the minute he put them on I would start crying,"" she said.

My dad finished grad school with a job as an analyst at a defense subcontractor that made aircraft engine parts. At that point, he had one year to work in the country under the Optional Practical Training (OPT) rule.

""I knew that I had to impress them enough in that one year that they would be willing to do my H-1 process,"" he said. ""Back then this whole immigrant visa and all that wasn't as big a known thing as it is now.""

A moment of uncertainty

About six months in, he gently broke the news to his employer that there was an additional process they'd have to go through to keep him for longer. Fortunately, the company agreed, hired an immigration lawyer, and in six months he had the H-1 visa, as it was called back then. By the end of 1989, he'd applied for and received a green card.

In 1986, the year my dad got his H-1, the US admitted 26,227 Indian immigrants overall, according to government data. Last year, Indians received 278,491 H-1B visas (including renewals) — more than 71% of the total. That's been the case for years, skewed by the tech industry which has long relied on the visa program to bring Indian engineers to the US. But country-specific limits on green cards imposed in 1965 mean that tens of thousands of Indians applying for a green card this year won't receive them until at least 2055 because of a huge backlog in petitions from India, according to a recent analysis of US immigration data by the libertarian think tank Cato Institute.

In the roughly three years that my dad was going through the now common work-visa-to-green-card process, my mom had switched from the F-2 visa to her own F-1 to do her Masters from Tufts University in Boston. She then joined tech company Pitney Bowes on her OPT, but only had to wait a few months since her green card was tied to my dad's.

My parents at their first home in the US in 1986, wearing hats my mom knitted.

Now nearly all those avenues are under attack. Less than two weeks after suspending H-1B visas for the rest of this year, the Trump administration announced all students at US universities on F-1 visas have to leave the country, transfer to another university or risk being deported if their fall semester is being held online amid the pandemic.

""This very rocky situation that exists wasn't there back then. There were uncertainties of the execution of the process, which is normal,"" my mom said. ""But [the notion] that the whole process can get an upheaval... that didn't exist.""

The most precarious moment they faced was just before the green card arrived, when my dad's company got acquired and planned to shut down the Connecticut plant where he worked. Had he still been on the H-1 and lost his job, he wouldn't have been able to file for unemployment and would have had to leave the country.

""It was a little bit touch-and-go,"" he told me. ""Luckily it came in time.""

Caught between two worlds

Soon after I was born, my dad decided to pursue another part of the American dream: entrepreneurship.

He left Gartner, the tech advisory firm where he would spend most of his career, to start his own firm, providing strategic consulting to US companies and also bringing consultants over from India to work on projects at those companies.

At that point, my dad had been in the US for almost 11 years and my mom had been here for eight, having also advanced in her career as a designer. They started to have what my dad referred to as ""the itch.""

""At all the Indian parties that was the favorite topic of conversation: 'Are you going to stay here or are you going to go back?'"" he said.

Many Indian workers increasingly choose to go back in a phenomenon known as ""reverse brain drain."" Exact numbers are hard to come by, but the growing frustration and uncertainty over immigration policy may now be spurring more Indians to consider returning home. A recent webinar for Indians contemplating a return from the US called ""Come Home and Build,"" organized by venture capital firm Lightspeed India, got so many sign-ups the organizers had to expand their Zoom subscription

In the early 90s, my parents witnessed a few friends who went to India, spent several months there and moved back to the US because it was too difficult to readjust to life back home.

A trip back to India for my first birthday made the decision clear. ""We came back here and realized what kind of a life it will be with [our] parents aging and bringing up a child in this culture,"" my mom said.

Family portait in 1995, shortly before we moved back to India.

Still, my parents continued to vacillate on the decision for a couple years — during which time my sister was born.

By that point, India had liberalized its economy, opening itself up to the rest of the world. My dad sensed the opportunity and successfully pitched Gartner — by then one of the clients of his new firm — on taking its tech advisory services to India.

In 1995, a few years before Y2K would put India's tech industry on the global map, my parents returned to Pune — a move timed so it would be before I started school. For my mother, that meant forfeiting a career and, potentially, a sense of individuality that America had allowed her to build.

""I got lots of recognition and appreciation for my work ... completely unrelated to who I was, where I came from,"" she said. ""That was a wonderful thing that I knew I wouldn't get in India ... going back was a very, very daunting process.""

But they decided that once they took the plunge, there would be no turning back. ""Most of those people ended up coming back to the US, [a] kind of path of least resistance,"" my dad said. ""We decided we're not going to try, come hell or high water, we'll make it work.""

How it's impacted me

Two decades later, my parents still live in Pune, but my sister and I live in the US.

Whenever someone asks, ""Where are you from?"" we don't have to think twice. We instinctively say, ""India,"" and immediately have a momentary identity crisis.

Everyone takes it at face value, though. And why wouldn't they? We've got the skin, we've got the accent. With that answer, no one's ever asked that dreaded follow-up question: ""But where are you really from ?""

We've spent most of our lives in India and it's where our roots are, but being American is also a fundamental part of our identity. I've never thought about giving up my US passport, but I imagine doing so would feel a bit like being locked out of half the rooms in my home.

It's also meant a lot of privilege guilt, especially growing up with friends now in the US going through the same process my parents once did — some of whom have already gone back, others who are planning to.

""I'm also mentally done with this whole uncertainty and insecure life where I don't know about what'll happen,"" one of those friends told me last week.

As so many wrestle with the decision of whether to stay in a country that now seems to be making it as difficult as possible for them to do so, I asked my parents what America represents to them. Their answers, recorded separately, were strikingly similar — and strikingly different to what the country feels like for many right now.

""The openness and acceptance, just merit is what gets you ahead,"" my dad said. ""It was really about what you could achieve and what you proved you could do.""

While watching the US from afar the last few years has ""diluted"" that image for him somewhat, ""I think the underlying spirit of the country still exists.""

My mom also used the word ""acceptance,"" soon after listing the other countries and cultures she was exposed to here -- friends from Egypt, Liechtenstein, Morocco, Tunisia, all brought together by the American Dream.

""The realization that people are the same everywhere, that used to hit me very starkly every time,"" she said. ""It didn't matter who you were, where you came from. What you did, your performance ... that is what mattered. It represented something wonderful, and that is the America we lived in.""",2020-07-12,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/12/opinions/us-immigration-visa-iyengar-essay/index.html
Analysis Jill Disis,A new world war over technology,"Hong Kong (CNN Business) Nations and companies around the world are being sucked into a running battle over the future of technology between the United States and China, forcing them to choose sides in a conflict that is fracturing global supply chains and pushing businesses out of lucrative markets.

The latest casualty is TikTok, a video app that is popular with teenagers and which has hundreds of millions of devoted fans across markets such as India and the United States. The app is owned by a Chinese company, but run by an American CEO

The first major hit came last month, when TikTok was blocked in India after a heated border clash with China left at least 20 Indian soldiers dead. Then, on Monday, US authorities said they would look at banning the app because they consider it a possible threat to national security. That news broke as the company said it would leave Hong Kong because of concerns over a sweeping national security law China imposed on the city.

""It is becoming harder to be a truly global tech platform,"" said Dipayan Ghosh, the co-director of the Digital Platforms and Democracy Project at the Harvard Kennedy School.

The fight right now between the world's two largest economies cuts to the heart of that issue. The United States and China are competing over artificial intelligence, super-fast 5G mobile networks and other technology. Although the countries have long-running economic ties that enable some collaboration, recent tensions over national security have pushed their governments and businesses to reconsider those partnerships.

The conflict is bleeding over into the relationships those countries have with other global powers, too. The United Kingdom, for example, is re-examining its decision to grant Chinese tech company Huawei the ability to help build the country's 5G network. That review comes after the United States, which has repeatedly targeted Huawei, imposed sanctions on the company that could prevent other firms from supplying it with the chipsets it needs to build its next-generation technology.

""My impression is that the tech companies are only now waking up to the fact that life in the future is going to be a lot less globalized,"" said Michael Witt, a senior affiliate professor of strategy and international business at INSEAD, the international business school. ""They are really on the horns of a dilemma.""

A bitter rivalry

IBM IBM Microsoft MSFT The United States and China have for decades held opposing views on how to wield technology. Whileandwere driving American innovation in the 1980s, China was laying down the foundation for its Great Firewall — a massive censorship mechanism that shuts out content widely available elsewhere on the internet. In the years since then, China has created a closed and controlled internet that has found fans among other authoritarian countries: Russia, for example, has moved to restructure and rein in its once freewheeling internet with the assistance of Chinese tech

The United States has responded by seeking to limit China's advance.

The Trump administration has accused China of stealing US technology, an issue central to the damaging trade war that has colored the relationship between the two since 2018. Chinese officials have repeatedly denied such allegations and argued that any tech secrets handed over were part of deals that had been mutually agreed upon. The United States has also imposed sanctions on prominent Chinese tech firms and taken steps to limit Beijing's access to America's vast capital markets

As Washington escalates its fight against Beijing, international technological cooperation looks increasingly likely to disappear.

""Beijing has concluded that decoupling is inevitable,"" wrote Ian Bremmer and Cliff Kupchan, the president and chairman of Eurasia Group, in a report published earlier this year that noted how Chinese President Xi Jinping is calling for the country to break its technological dependence on the United States.

""China will expand efforts to reshape international technology, trade, and financial architecture to better promote its interests in an increasingly bifurcated world,"" they wrote.

Huawei is a prime example of global tech tensions. Washington has for more than a year been pressuring its allies to keep the Chinese company's equipment out of their 5G networks.

The 'virtual Berlin Wall'

As the relationship between the world's two largest economies deteriorates, several analysts warned that the fallout will have major implications for every global power, along with the tech companies that operate across their borders.

The Eurasia Group analysts wrote that the ""new virtual Berlin Wall"" will push world economies to choose sides. They said traditional US allies such as Taiwan and South Korea, for example, may tilt toward China because they supply cutting-edge semiconductors that Chinese firms rely on to compete with global rivals.

""Both the US and China have demonstrated they're willing to weaponize global trade and supply chains,"" the analysts added.

Global tensions are also causing countries to view tech firms as ""national sectors, and not global actors,"" said Samm Sacks, a senior fellow at Yale Law School's Paul Tsai China Center who studies cybersecurity and US-China relations.

""It's the idea that a tech company is going into a market on the other side of the world, and now is being asked to carry the flag of the country,"" she added. ""This is a sea change from even a decade ago.""

Huawei has perhaps become the most prominent example of that shift.

Washington has for more than a year been pressuring its allies to keep the Chinese company's telecommunications equipment out of their 5G networks. That campaign may be producing some results in Europe: UK authorities said last week that US sanctions on the company will likely hurt Huawei's viability as a 5G network provider there, while Reuters reported Thursday that Italy's largest telecom firm is excluding the company from a bid for 5G equipment.

The advancement of technology in other parts of the world also suggests that there are ""evolving, multiple playbooks"" beyond the rivalry between the United States and China, according to Kislaya Prasad, a research professor at the University of Maryland's Robert H. Smith School of Business.

Retreat or decentralize

For the tech companies stuck trying to navigate this world, there are no easy options.

Witt, the INSEAD professor, said firms must choose between giving up on part of the world, or decentralizing their operations to such a point that the company is essentially two or more different entities.

TikTok seems to be trying the second approach. While the app is owned by Beijing-based ByteDance, it has taken great pains to distance itself from its parent company. In May, it hired former Disney executive Kevin Mayer as its CEO, and it has repeatedly said that its data centers are located entirely outside of China where that data is not subject to Chinese law.

The company might be trying to make an even more dramatic break. The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday , citing a source familiar with the matter, that ByteDance is considering establishing a headquarters for the video app outside of China or a new management board to distance the service from the country. A TikTok spokesperson confirmed to CNN Business that its parent company is weighing changes to its corporate structure.

""The close connection to the Chinese government is what has shut Huawei out of so many markets,"" said Ghosh, of the Harvard Kennedy School. (Huawei maintains that it is a private firm owned by its employees.)

""I think TikTok sees that and wants to distinguish itself from Huawei,"" he added.

But that might not be enough. US lawmakers have repeatedly piled on TikTok in recent weeks. And while the company says it doesn't pose any threats to national security, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo mentioned those concerns this week when he floated the idea of banning the app

""The problem is, I think, for them it's too late,"" Witt said. ""That light of public attention, that is already brightly shining on them. I think that's not going to end well for them.""

Julia Hollingsworth,One million foreign students risk being frozen out of US colleges. Some might never come back,"(CNN) In two months, 19-year-old Tianyu Fang is due to start his first semester at one of the most prestigious schools in America: Stanford University in California. Now, the Chinese national isn't sure if he'll make it.

Fang is one of the million or so international students who could be made to leave the United States if their universities switch to online-only learning, under a rule announced by Washington on Monday . Those who don't leave voluntarily face deportation.

Some universities have announced they will deliver all courses online due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has infected more than 2.9 million people and killed more than 130,000 in the US alone . Other universities are still planning to run classes on campus, but with the US outbreak still not under control, there's a risk that those institutions could go remote, too.

More than half of international students in the US come from Asia. In the 2018-2019 academic year, 370,000 students were from China, 202,000 from India, and 52,000 from South Korea.

For Fang, who has studied in the US since middle school but returned to Beijing earlier this year, Monday's announcement exacerbates an already complicated situation. To get around the US ban on travelers who have been in China in the past two weeks, he planned to fly from China to Cambodia. After 14 days, he would hopefully fly to the US.

Now, things are even harder. Currently, Stanford plans to stagger which students are on campus each semester to maintain social distancing. First year students will be on campus in the fall and summer terms -- meaning Fang will be studying remotely in one semester and will have to leave the US for that period.

Even that will be challenging. There are few flights between the US and China, where international arrivals have to quarantine for two weeks.

Now, Fang is weighing up whether he wants to pay about $60,000 a year to study remotely from China. If he does, he won't have all the unplanned interactions and conversations that usually come with a school experience.

Living with uncertainty

For now, 29-year-old Chinese national Chen Na isn't affected by Monday's changes.

At New York University (NYU), where Chen is halfway through a two-year master's degree, her courses will be a combination of online and offline when fall semester starts.

But there's a chance that NYU could go back to online-only classes, as it did in March.

""I can't stop thinking about it,"" she said. ""I just feel kind of powerless and vulnerable. I will try my best to stay here legally.""

If courses go online-only, transferring to another university won't be an option -- few other schools offer the Interactive Telecommunications Program Chen is studying.

Instead, she would have to try to go back to China, which would be expensive.

When Chen first heard the rule change, she felt desensitized as there have been a number of other policies that make things more difficult for international students.

In May, for instance, New York Times and Reuters reported that the US was planning to cancel the visas of thousands of Chinese graduate students and researchers with ties to universities affiliated with the People's Liberation Army. In April, Republican Senator Tom Cotton suggested Chinese students at US universities shouldn't be allowed to study science and technology. The Trump administration has also made a litany of changes to the US immigration system , citing the coronavirus pandemic, which have resulted in barring swaths of immigrants from coming to the country.

""We don't have much power here, and then sometimes we become the sacrifice for all these political games,"" Chen said. ""I'm really aware of my foreign status here, I know I'm a foreigner. I don't necessarily see an increasing hostility from other people, but I do feel like policy-wise, it's crushing us.""

The difficulty in getting home

It may be harder for some students to get home than others.

Theresa Cardinal Brown, director of immigration and cross-border policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center, says some student might not be able to home might at all.

""The bigger issue is some of these countries have travel restrictions on and they can't go home, so what do they do then?"" she added. ""It's a conundrum for a lot of students.""

Her university has said it will offer hybrid courses, but the 22-year-old fromo Gujarat state, still doesn't know whether her specific classes will be online or offline.

Parsana says there are no flights to India, but she hopes her government would arrange flights to get stranded students back home.

""I am definitely scared, I really don't know what to do. I was already stressed about my school and now i have to stress about one more thing,"" she said, adding that the US appears to be focusing on international students rather than addressing real problems, such as the pandemic.

""We just feel like we're being pushed away from this country for no reason.""

Business impacts

It's not just students who may be hurt by Monday's decision. It could impact the US economy, too.

In 2018, students from China, India and South Korea alone contributed more than $25 billion to the economy, according to non-profit Institute of International Education.

If students are forced to leave the country, they may not be willing to continue paying tuition fees to study remotely from a different time zone.

Nicholas Henderson, the co-founder and director of Essai Education, a Delhi based test-prep and counseling institute for Indian students wanting to study in the US, said that the regulations may prompt colleges to change their policies to hybrid models, for instance, to help people stay.

""I think what Covid has shown is that universities are willing to work with the students,"" he said.

But even so, there's the risk that the US' policies may discourage future students from choosing to study in the US.

When Parsana first came to the US, she planned to try to settle there. Now, she says she doesn't want to live in the US, and would encourage students looking to study abroad to consider another country, like Australia or Canada.

""I don't know what (the US government is) trying to do because their economy is going to go to ashes if they do this,"" Parsana said. ""If they keep on doing these kinds of rules, not a lot of people are going to come here for their education.""

Career impacts

If international students are sent home early, it's not just their education that will be impacted. Students could end up missing out on job opportunities -- often one of the reasons they might have chosen to study in the US in the first place.

In the US, international students qualify for a scheme that allows them to work in the country after they graduate.

A 24-year-old South Korean university student says he feels ""disappointed"" that, due to Monday's policy change, he may miss out on that scheme. CNN agreed not to use his real name because of his concerns for privacy.

He only has one semester of his degree to go, and when he signed up for his courses, they were all offline. Now, they have changed to online courses, and it seems like he will either have to go home or transfer to another university for his final semester.

""I have no idea what's going on,"" he said. ""I just renewed my house contract.""

If he goes home, he won't qualify for the temporary employment scheme -- and if he wants to work in the US, he'll likely need to find a company to sponsor his visa.

""I'm so frustrated,"" he said. ""I just want to get some opportunities at least to compete.""

Chen is faced with a similar situation. Before the pandemic, she planned to stay in the US and find a job after graduating in 2021. But now, Chen is weighing up whether the US is the best place to be, after all.

Analysis Laura He,China and India are sparring but neither can afford a full-on trade war,"Hong Kong (CNN Business) Last month's deadly border battle between India and China has already begun to affect business and technology. But the world's two most populous countries have a lot to lose should the dispute escalate into a full-on trade war.

New Delhi has indicated that it is willing to exert economic pressure on its neighbor. Trade organizations in the country reported last week that Chinese shipments were suddenly being held up at Indian checkpoints, while authorities in one state paused hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Chinese business deals. And earlier this week India took the dramatic step of banning dozens of mobile apps, including well-known Chinese ones like ByteDance's TikTok,WeChat, and social media network

The backlash has reached the highest political levels: Weibo said this week that it had removed Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's account at the Indian government's request.

Beijing's response so far has been cautious. Chinese officials said Tuesday that they were ""strongly concerned"" about the app ban, for example, but they did not threaten any kind of retaliation. And on Friday, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stressed that the two countries should work together, adding that barriers to cooperation ""will harm India's interests."" Some Chinese state media have called for ""cooler"" heads to prevail.

""As of now, China is only assessing the situation,"" said Geethanjali Nataraj, an economics professor at the Indian Institute of Public Administration (IIPA). A ""trade war is not going to benefit either of the countries,"" she added.

China's tough line

China has plenty of leverage, if it chooses to retaliate for India's app ban.

It has long been a critical trade partner for India. From April 2019 to March 2020, India bought $65 billion worth of goods from China, accounting for nearly 14% of its total imports, according to Indian government data. Meanwhile, China bought $16.6 billion worth of goods from India. China was India's second largest trading partner for that period behind the United States, though that value of trade does not include Hong Kong.

India accounts for a much smaller share of China's total trade. Exports to India comprised only 3% of China's total in 2019, according to Chinese government statistics. And India was only China's 12th biggest trade partner last year.

But analysts who spoke to CNN Business stressed that any kind of warfare, economic or otherwise, with an Asian neighbor would be costly for Beijing. The world's second largest economy is already managing pressures on several fronts, including a Western backlash over a new, controversial security law for Hong Kong and its handling of the coronavirus pandemic. China is also managing its own economic struggles, including a historic first-quarter contraction and rising unemployment.

""China is holding a tough line on the territorial dispute with India, but it doesn't want to see a confrontation,"" according to Deng Yuwen, a researcher at the US-based think tank China Strategic Analysis Center, who detailed his thoughts in a video posted online last month.

Nataraj of the IIPA pointed out that China also likely doesn't want to jeopardize its trading relationship with India, either, given the fact that the country still sends tens of billions of dollars of goods to India each year.

""Chinese companies are already facing trade restrictions from [the United States] and other countries, and they are faced with over capacity,"" she said. ""Therefore, it is not easy for China to ignore a big market like India.""

Even so, there are political considerations at play for Beijing. Deng said that China can't be too ""soft"" on territorial disputes, or else it could risk angering the public.

""The Chinese public doesn't think China should give in to India,"" Deng added. ""In the people's perspective, China and India are like two boxers of different weight classes. It shouldn't be hard for the heavyweight to defeat the lightweight."" (India does, however, have significant experience with ground combat and air forces, and recent studies suggest the country maintains an edge in high-altitude mountainous environments, such as the one where the 2020 face-off is taking place.)

India's dilemma

India, meanwhile, is likely to ""lose more"" from engaging in a trade war with China, according to Nataraj.

Like many other countries, Asia's third-largest economy has been hit hard by the pandemic and the lockdown measures it imposed to prevent the virus from spreading. Industrial production shrank dramatically this spring, while the services industry collapsed. Business activity was still struggling through June , according to data about the services sector released Friday.

Nataraj said that many industries in India — including electronics, pharmaceuticals and IT hardware — are heavily dependent on imports, particularly from China.

Shipping and delivery companies have confirmed that the dispute is already causing disruption. DHL Express India told CNN Business on Friday that it is ""temporarily suspending pick up of import shipments from mainland China, Hong Kong and Macao due to recent delays in customs clearance of shipments into India."" And FedEx said that it is ""currently facing backlogs beyond our control, leading to congestion at our facilities.""

""Though there is nothing wrong in [being] vocal for local [business], the immediate short term anti-China momentum would affect the supply chain of Indian production networks,"" Nataraj said, adding that arbitrary import restrictions or consumer boycotts will be largely ""self-defeating.""

Potential retaliation

Even if both countries have reason to not engage in a trade war, analysts pointed out that raw emotions could push them toward escalation.

""There is a clear understanding in India that China could retaliate and that India is more dependent on Chinese products than the other way round, but the mood in India is one of acute resentment and anger,"" according to Kanti Bajpai, a professor at the National University of Singapore who studies Indian foreign policy and India-China relations. At least 20 Indian soldiers died during June's clash with Chinese troops in the Himalayas, according to the Indian army

""If the confrontation persists, Delhi may take economic actions on trade as well,"" Bajpai added.

In retaliation, Beijing could ""slow walk"" some of the market access it has promised India in areas such as pharmaceuticals and agriculture, according to Rick Rossow, the Wadhwani Chair in US-India Policy Studies at the Washington-based Center for Strategies and International Studies.

China could also pull back on new investments it was looking to make in India, he said.

Investment from China has poured into Indian startups and manufacturing but it was already becoming a point of contention. In April, the Indian government announced that foreign direct investment from countries that share a land border with India would be subject to more scrutiny.

""The economic consequences of these moves are likely to be modest initially, but the bigger impact could come if India decides to break away from China and secure stronger strategic ties with countries such as the United States, Japan, Australia and France,"" Rossow added.

Rhea Mogul,One of India's richest minority groups enjoys some of Mumbai's best rents. Here's why,"(CNN) ""Imagine a world within a world."" That is how Hormuz Bana describes the centuries-old community where he lives in Mumbai -- and which is in danger of vanishing.

Located below the Eastern Express Highway, this storied enclave is everything that most of Mumbai is not: idyllic, languid, and devoid of the city's signature traffic.

""Living here has given me a sense of belonging,"" says the 30-year-old marketing executive.

Bana lives in Dadar Parsi Colony, one of 25 colonies in Mumbai that officials designed solely for Parsis, an ethnoreligious group of Persian descendants in India who follow the Zoroastrian religion.

The Zoroastrians, whose doctrines influenced the principles of Judaism and Christianity, fled from Persia -- modern-day Iran -- to India in the 7th century to avoid political and religious persecution. Over centuries, a thriving community of bankers, industrialists, traders and engineers grew along India's west coast.

A Parsi temple in Mumbai on March 12, 2012.

But their numbers are dwindling. According to Indian Census data , there were more than 100,000 Parsis in the country in 1941. By 2011, there were fewer than 60,000. And by 2050, experts predict numbers will drop to about 40,000.

As numbers dwindle and the community fights to sustain itself, progressives want to widen the remit for new members. But they face strong resistance from more orthodox Parsis, who believe any dilution of their faith is sacrilegious.

Inside the enclave

Dadar Parsi Colony was established in the mid-1890s after the bubonic plague tore through Bombay, as Mumbai was then known, claiming thousands of lives.

At the time, the city was home to about 800,000 people, and the illness quickly spread through crowded slums. To ease congestion, the city's British colonial leaders expanded Bombay's limits to Dadar, then a low-lying marshland.

Visionary engineer Mancherji Edulji Joshi persuaded British authorities to set aside plots for lower middle-class Parsis, and drew up a blueprint of a model neighborhood, detailed to the type of flowers and trees to be planted on the streets. Joshi was given a 999-year lease for 103 plots.

Khorshed Villa, one of the oldest buildings in Dadar Parsi Colony.

In Dadar, the colony's leafy streets were laid out in a grid formation, lined by low-rise Victorian apartment blocks.

""He had a rule that no building should be more than two stories high,"" says Joshi's granddaughter, Zarine Engineer. ""Before a single house was constructed, he planted the streets with trees, each street with a different kind.""

Jam-e-Jamshed Road -- named after the prominent Parsi newspaper -- still has rows of ashoka trees. Firdausi Road, named after the Persian poet Firdawsi, is dappled with mahogany.

There is a library, a function hall, sports grounds, a seminary, a school, and a temple. The buildings are named after their proprietors: Dina House, Readymoney House and Marker House. It was not uncommon for Parsis' surnames to reflect their line of work.

The Readymoneys, for example, made their fortune by trading opium, which was a ready source of money. Another family, the Sodawaterbottleopenerwalas -- ""wala"" meaning ""of a place of trade"" -- most likely made a business of opening soda water bottles. It remains one of the best-known Parsi surnames and there's even an Indian chain of restaurants named after them.

Largest colony

Of all the Parsi colonies in Mumbai, Dadar Parsi Colony remains the largest. It is home to about 15,000 Parsis, roughly 12% of the community's global population.

Every morning, sometimes as early as 4:30 a.m., the colony's fitness enthusiasts power walk up and down the streets. Many of the older residents surface slightly later, perched on their verandas to pry on what's happening beneath them.

Soon, the fishmongers and vegetable sellers make their way to each apartment, selling their daily produce. The garbage collectors dutifully come to collect the garbage, and the launder does the same for clothes. There's an ironing man to collect and drop off ironed clothes, and the knife sharpener visits to sharpen knives.

But over the years, there have been attempts to thwart the community's traditional way of life. Engineer has, time and time again, fought off threats of encroachment on the colony by municipal corporations.

Ninety-year-old twins Mithoo and Mani Contractor, Joshi's cousins, have lived in the colony all their lives.

Joshi's granddaughter, Zarine Engineer, 75, another Dadar Parsi Colony local, sits on the same board of trustees that her grandfather did, the Parsi Central Association (PCA).

The PCA looks after the well being of the colony's residents -- although 99 years later, the PCA's methods have changed. Now, it has a WhatsApp group, in which members voice their complaints -- perhaps a broken street lamp or a pothole -- and Engineer will arrange for it to be fixed.

""When I was a young girl, I would sit beside (Joshi) as he patiently listened to the qualms of the residents,"" says Engineer. ""Some would complain of monkeys entering their house through windows, or a fallen tree, and today I am doing the same.""

The apartments are cheap -- and empty

Today, Mumbai's extreme wealth disparity has earned it the moniker of the world's ""most expensive slum.""

More than half of its residents live in slums with no running water, often just feet from some of the city's most expensive high-rises. The average rent for a two-bedroom apartment in the wider Dadar district costs an average Rs. 145,000 ($1,920) a month.

But rents inside all 25 of Mumbai's Parsi colonies have barely increased in decades. Long-time tenants continue to pay about Rs. 300 ($4) per month, and most are no longer perceived as lower-middle class.

Parsis are one of the most successful and wealthy minority groups in the world. They make up less than 1% of India's entire population, but four Parsis sit on the country's list of top 20 billionaires.

Apartments like the ones in the Parsi colonies -- spacious, well maintained and low in cost -- are hard to come by in Mumbai. Their interiors are a blend of British and Chinese influences, from Victorian motifs carved into oak bed frames to porcelain vases obtained through trade with mainland China.

Rents have remained low because of the Rent Control Act from 1947, which regulates the housing market in Mumbai and limits increase for residents who have been living in the same apartment prior to 1947, said Viraf Mehta, a trustee of the Bombay Parsi Punchayet (BPP).

The BPP owns most of the apartments in the Parsi colonies, including about 3,000 which fall under the act, as the same families have lived in those apartments for generations.

Mehta says the BPP rarely increases rents for newer residents ""out of benevolence.""

Colony apartments are highly sought after for their unique features and low price. Yet about a quarter of flats in the colonies remain empty, according to Mehta. Many of the occupants have settled overseas, but continue to pay the rent to ensure they don't lose the flat.

""The turnover rate is extremely low,"" says Mehta. ""We have close to 1,000 people on waiting lists wanting a flat in one of the colonies, but there are no vacant houses.""

Everyone on the waiting list is a Parsi.

Not open

Joshi couldn't afford to build a wall around the colony -- and, as a result, Dadar remains the only Parsi enclave without one. But the lack of a physical wall doesn't mean there aren't barriers to entry for those wishing to join the community.

After the BPP sold three plots to a developer some years ago , in 2009, that developer want to sell apartments on the plot to the highest bidder -- even if they were not Parsi.

The PCA eventually won a six-year battle against the developers, and a court granted a permanent injunction restraining the builder from selling flats inside the colony to anyone who was not a Zoroastrian.

Five years later, the Street Vendors' Act -- a nationwide bill aimed at improving the lives of street vendors -- would have paved the way for street stalls in Dardar colony. Led by Engineer, hundreds of people marched in protest to preserve the colony's heritage.

The plan was withdrawn and the colony's roads remain off limits.

Bana, an ordained Zoroastrian priest, lives in an apartment block built by his great-grandfather. His father grew up there, and his grandmother before that.

""To a layman, it would be very difficult to identify where the colony begins and ends,"" he says. ""But to us, we know each nook and cranny like the back of our hands.""

Declining population

Since the 1940s, the number of Parsis in India has plunged.

According to a study by demographer Ava Khullar, there are several reasons for to this phenomenon. Low fertility is one -- about a third of Parsis don't marry, and the average Parsi woman of child-bearing age has one child, compared to a national average of 2.5 children.

The exclusion of children born to women who marry non-Parsi men in the population figures is also a key reason.

The rule became legally binding following the Petit v Jijabhai case in 1908 . Suzanne Briere, a French woman and wife of the Parsi industrialist Ratanji Dadabhoy Tata, wished for her body to be left in Bombay's dokhmas, or Towers of Silence, to be exposed to vultures, per traditional Zoroastrian death rites.

After her marriage, she converted to Zoroastrianism by undergoing an initiation ritual performed by a priest. During the ceremony, individuals wear a sudreh (a sacred muslin tunic) and kusti (sacred thread) for the first time, while reciting prayers, completing their initiation into the faith.

Whether this conversion was permitted was up for dispute, as orthodox Parsis believed being born into the community was a prerequisite for initiation.

A child undertakes the Zoroastrian initiation ceremony in Mumbai in 1999.

Briere took her case to the Bombay High Court, where Justices Dinshaw Davar and Frank Beamon concluded that the Parsi community consists of Parsis who are born of both Zoroastrian parents who profess the Zoroastrian religion; Iranis from Persia professing the Zoroastrian religion; and the children of Parsi fathers by ""alien"" (non-Parsi) mothers who have been duly and properly admitted into the religion. The legal definition excludes the children of Parsi mothers by ""alien"" (non-Parsi) fathers.

Years later, the same rules are largely followed. Reformists argue it is sexist and bigoted, while others believe that it is the way things should be. ""I think it is our duty to ensure that we keep our race going,"" says Bana, who married a fellow Zoroastrian.

""I have no opinion on interfaith marriages. But personally, I think these are some things we can do to give back to a community when it has given us so much.""

Locked out of the colony

The BPP follows the same 1908 judgment made by Justices Davar and Beamon. If one spouse is non-Parsi, they are not deemed eligible for colony life.

""As far as the BPP is concerned, this is the law of the land,"" says Mehta. ""Whatever my personal beliefs are, I have a duty to uphold the trust deed which is bound by this.""

In 2019, Sanaya Dalal, a Parsi woman married to a half-Parsi man and resident of Dadar Parsi Colony, challenged these rules after her five-year-old son wasn't granted membership to the colony's gym for being ""a non-Parsi.""

""So I'm supposed to explain to my son that he'll have to bow out gracefully, leaving behind his friends and the playground that he loves so much,"" she wrote in an opinion piece

Dalal's case caused controversy within the community, with conservative members supporting the rule and progressive members deeming them anachronistic. After some debate, her son remains without membership, and is not allowed to enter the clubhouse unless signed in by a member.

Farzeen Khan, a 29-year-old Parsi woman who grew up in Khareghat Colony, sides with Dalal. ""The solution (to the falling numbers) is to be more inclusive,"" she says.

""We are one of the smallest but wealthiest communities in the country. I think it's time to open our doors and see how we can be more inclusive, rather than cling onto our exclusive identity from yesteryear,"" says Khan.

Despite their disagreements, Bana, the Zoroastrian priest, says Parsis will find a way to continue their legacy.

""We aren't a community that focuses on the negative,"" says Bana. ""I'm certain we will overcome any hurdle that comes our way, be it interfaith marriages, or extinction.""",2020-07-04,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/04/india/india-parsi-colony-intl-hnk/index.html
Sherisse Pham,How much trouble is Huawei in?,"Fresh US sanctions have cut off the Chinese tech company's access to vital American technology to a greater extent than ever before. Countries and mobile network operators around the world are now questioning whether Huawei will be able to deliver on its 5G promises . And rising anti-China sentiment in India and elsewhere is not helping matters.

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared last month that ""the tide is turning against Huawei as citizens around the world are waking up to the danger of the Chinese Communist Party's surveillance state.""

Those remarks were ""a bit pre-emptive,"" said Carisa Nietsche, a researcher at the Center for a New American Security, a Washington think tank.

Pompeo lauded countries such as the Czech Republic, Poland and Estonia for ""only allowing trusted vendors in their 5G networks."" But Nietsche noted that many of those countries made up their minds last year, when they signaled they wouldn't work with Huawei . And European countries with much bigger economies, such as the United Kingdom, France and Germany, have yet to announce a total ban on Huawei.

But there is ""the beginning of a sea change in Europe,"" Nietsche said.

European countries and mobile carriers are now worried that Huawei won't be able to provide 5G infrastructure as promised given the ""massive hit to their business"" from the new US export controls, she said.

Huawei's 5G business in 'grave danger'

Huawei has been here before. Last year, the US government barred American firms from selling tech and supplies to the Shenzhen-based company without first obtaining a license to do so. Huawei stockpiled inventory and found alternative suppliers, and as a result, continued doing brisk business despite the US ban. The company's overseas smartphone sales took a hit , though, because it was forced to release new models that weren't able to access to popular Google apps.

Even after reporting a strong finish to 2019, however, Huawei warned that 2020 would be ""difficult.""

That would prove to be all too true.

Huawei's Shenzhen headquarters. Its 5G business is in danger, as the company battles a prolonged American campaign against its business.

than last year's ban. It applies to any global firms using American equipment to make semiconductors. The new rule restricts companies like TSMC, a Taiwan-based firm, from exporting computer chipsets and other key components to Huawei. The latest US sanction announced in May cuts much deeperthan last year's ban. It applies to any global firms using American equipment to make semiconductors. The new rule restricts companies like TSMC, a Taiwan-based firm, from exporting computer chipsets and other key components to Huawei.

Without those chipsets, Huawei can't build 5G base stations and other equipment, according to analysts at brokerage firm Jefferies.

""Based on the current direct export rule that the US put on, I really think that Huawei's 5G equipment business is in grave danger,"" Jefferies analyst Edison Lee said on a recent call with investors.

""If the law doesn't change, and if the US-China tension does not de-escalate, then I think there's a big risk that Huawei will stop being able to provide 5G equipment"" from early next year, he added.

Asked for comment for this story, Huawei spokeswoman Evita Cao said ""we continue to receive support from our customers,"" without going into further detail.

The company said in May that it ""categorically opposes"" the latest US sanction, calling the new rule ""discriminatory.""

""It will have a serious impact on a wide number of global industries"" and damage ""collaboration within the global semiconductor industry,"" Huawei said in a statement. ""We expect that our business will inevitably be affected,"" it added.

That may already be happening in the United Kingdom.

On Saturday, the UK-based Telegraph newspaper reported that Prime Minister Boris Johnson is poised to begin phasing out Huawei 5G tech in Britain ""as soon as this year,"" walking back a decision that granted Huawei a limited role in building that network.

Earlier last week, Oliver Dowden, the country's digital and media secretary, said that the US sanctions will ""likely have an impact on the viability of Huawei as a provider for the 5G network.""

""I am not a Sinophobe, I won't be drawn into Sinophobia,"" Johnson said on Tuesday. But ""I do want to see our critical national infrastructure properly protected from hostile state vendors, so we need to strike that balance.""

Huawei said earlier this year that it has secured 91 commercial 5G contracts, more than half (47) are in Europe, 27 are in Asia and 17 are elsewhere in the world.

China tensions

The United States has long viewed Huawei warily , suspicious of how closely the company is tied to the Chinese Communist Party. The company maintains that it is a private firm owned by thousands of its employees.

Critics also say Beijing could force Huawei to spy on other nations. Huawei says that has never happened and if it did, the company would refuse such orders.

Yet even as it claims independence from Beijing, Huawei has been caught up in sparring between China and the United States, and to an increasing degree, the European Union and countries such as India that are growing more wary of China.

The coronavirus pandemic has only strained relations further. Some countries, such as the United States , have blamed China for the outbreak, and others have been put off by what they see as Beijing's aggressive response to criticism.

There was a moment during the pandemic ""where China was able to assert itself on the global stage as a leader, and I think they fumbled that,"" especially in Europe, after China sent masks and respirators of dubious quality to countries experiencing outbreaks, said Nietsche.

There are now ""excellent signals"" coming from Germany and the United Kingdom ""that they will move to exclude or at least will take Huawei out of the core [5G] network,"" said Nietsche. Germany, for instance, is scrutinizing Huawei's data flows to see if the company is breaching European laws, she said.

India, meanwhile, had been going back and forth over whether to include Huawei equipment in the country's 5G network, said Chaitanya Giri, an analyst with Indian foreign policy think tank Gateway House. Huawei received the green light to participate in 5G trials late last year.

But tensions between New Delhi and Beijing have risen dramatically in recent weeks after at least 20 Indian soldiers were killed in border clashes with Chinese troops stationed in the Himalayas. China has also been singled out in India for blame over the coronavirus pandemic, according to Giri.

Some Indians have been calling for a boycott of Chinese goods. And in a move widely seen as retaliation against China, the Indian government last week banned TikTok and several other Chinese apps , saying they pose a ""threat to sovereignty and integrity.""

Huawei may now get caught up in the escalating tensions, according to Giri. Public sentiment has now ""consolidated, that we are not going to use any of the Chinese equipment,"" he said.

What Europe and India share, according to Giri, is a growing sense of unease following years of substantial investment by China.

""Big democracies right now are singing in a chorus,"" he said. ""They understand what's at stake.""",2020-07-04,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/04/tech/huawei-5g-india-europe-intl-hnk/index.html
Catherine E. Shoichet,Padma Lakshmi says this ingredient makes American food great,"(CNN) — What do ceviche, pad thai and hot dogs have in common?

They're all foods immigrants brought to the United States. And they're among the many meals featured in Padma Lakshmi's ""Taste the Nation.""

In her 10-episode series streaming on Hulu, the cookbook author, model and longtime ""Top Chef"" host is tackling a tough question.

""What exactly is American food?"" she asks in the show's opening credits. ""And what makes us American?""

Lakshmi came to the United States from India when she was 4 years old. And there's one key ingredient she argues makes American food great: immigration.

To make her case, Lakshmi travels across the United States, focusing on different cuisines -- and the people behind them -- in each episode.

She samples burritos as border surveillance helicopters hover overhead in El Paso, Texas. She dines on dosas and swaps stories about growing up Indian-American with former US Attorney Preet Bharara in New York. She cooks kabobs and wanders through Persian market aisles in Los Angeles.

And along her journey, Lakshmi points out that foods now assumed to be American have immigrant roots. As she tours Milwaukee in an episode dubbed ""The All American Weiner,"" she notes that even famed meat company founder Oscar Mayer immigrated to the United States from Germany in 1873.

Gullah Geechee cuisine in Charleston, South Carolina, Chinese cuisine in San Francisco, Native American cuisine in Arizona, Peruvian cuisine in New Jersey, Thai cuisine in Las Vegas and Japanese cuisine in Honolulu are also on the menu in this season of ""Taste the Nation.""

Lakshmi has been a vocal critic of President Trump and a prominent advocate for immigrant rights since he took office. But she's hoping her show, like the food it features, will be a bridge crossing the political divide.

""The show was designed for people who don't think like me, who don't think that immigration is a good thing and are afraid of it or threatened by it. ... I hope that this show gives them a clearer idea of what immigration feels like and looks like in a human way, on the ground, in people's daily lives,"" she says.

Lakshmi spoke with CNN this week about her own immigrant experience, how restaurants she visited are faring amid the coronavirus pandemic and the places and cuisines she'd like to explore next. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Every episode of ""Taste the Nation"" begins with you holding a photo of yourself as a 4-year-old who just immigrated to the US. What do you remember about those first days in America and what they were like for you? And how do you feel like that time shaped who you are today?

It was very exciting to come to New York as a 4-year-old from India. I was, of course, very happy to be joined with my mother. I had been separated from her for two years when I was a toddler. So that also informs my thinking about this issue.

I thought that New York was an exciting, wonderful place. I remember her taking me to the local A&P Market. And I remember thinking, ""Oh, my God. Look at all this stuff."" The shops that my grandmother and I went to in South India were really small. They had one or two choices for what you needed. So all of that abundance really made a mark on me. At that time in India in the 70s, there was one type of sliced white bread...it was a knock-off of Wonder Bread, right down to the colors and the packaging. But we walked down this bread aisle and there were at least 15-20 different choices, just from the sliced breads. I'd never seen English muffins before. All of these things were just so overwhelming.

And there's a moment when I go to the Tehran Market in the Persian episode (of ""Taste the Nation""), looking at everything because I've never been to a specifically Persian grocery store before. And it's the same feeling I had as a child of being totally overstimulated and not knowing where to look. It's a sort of the Disneyland of food in both instances. So I'm glad I haven't lost my childhood appreciation of a food market.

What is it like to be launching a show that focuses largely on restaurants and traveling around the US and immigration at a time when because of this pandemic, a lot of people can't travel, a lot of restaurants are struggling and immigration has basically ground to a halt?

It's very strange to be promoting anything at this time when there are so many pressing issues in our country to address. We filmed this show last summer, but it feels like a lifetime ago. I hope that the show will allow people to travel vicariously and eat out a little bit through the show and through the places I go.

What's happening to the restaurant industry is devastating. But we will rebuild. They will come back. We don't know in what form. Many will not come back. I have been in touch with a handful of the people and restaurants that we visit on the show to just check in on them and see how they're doing. Some are open for takeout. Some are open for delivery or curbside pickup. Some are still shuttered because they don't believe that they have a way to make food without putting their employees at risk.

I hope that in time of upheaval, and necessary uprising, food can be an example, a positive example of what's great about immigration and what's great about inclusivity and diversity and why we need all these different nationalities. To be able to offer them a haven and a chance at a better life will give us the ability to renew and refresh our economy and our culture. And we need that.

In a lot of episodes, you chat with people about their struggles growing up in the US and trying to walk a tightrope between two cultures. Former U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara talks about being bullied as a kid, and how he knew people growing up who'd rather be mistaken for another ethnicity than admit they were Indian. And you tell him that you changed your name briefly in high school, to Angelique. Why was it important for you to bring up that moment in your life and issues like this as part of the show?

Because I think it's telling. You know, it's a result of a symptom of not feeling totally accepted and welcome. And, you know, it's something I'm kind of embarrassed about, but it's something that I needed to reveal in order to be truthful with my own story in that episode, as much as I'm asking other people, in other episodes and communities, to be truthful about their experience and personal history.

It also allows all the people I went to high school with to know that it's me.

When you made that decision at that time to change your name, why did you do that?

I think my name is pretty easy to pronounce, maybe not my last name, but certainly my first name. But people mangle it all the time, including every teacher who ever called attendance at the beginning of each school year in each class. So it was just a way to avoid that. And it was the only thing I could think of to make me less different, more approachable, more the same. I don't know -- it certainly didn't work. I still looked like I look and still was the person I was -- and am. But I think when you're a vulnerable adolescent girl, you just want to seem non-threatening, or non-strange.

In the show, you don't gloss over some of the shameful chapters of American history that are connected to many of the rich culinary traditions that you're highlighting, like Japanese internment camps or forced migration and enslavement of people from West Africa or the Chinese Exclusion Act. Why did you decide to take that approach?

History matters. It's important to know that the foods we love have a lot of baggage attached to them, and it doesn't mean we shouldn't love them or can't appreciate them and enjoy them. But we should understand the origins of our collective cuisine in this country, because if you understand how food evolved in America, you understand how America evolved. And I think that's interesting.

I've always been a history nerd and a food nerd. So I just took a gamble that other people would find it interesting too. I did not want to do another food show that was just kind of easy, breezy and lifestyle-y, for lack of a better word. I thought there were already some of those around and they kind of bore me now. There's a lot of great food programing. I just wanted mine to be in as much as possible what I would want to watch. And it is.

In the season's finale, Lakshmi explores the influence of Japanese culture in Honolulu. Along the way, she slings fish, rolls sushi and visits vast sugar cane fields. Dominic Valente/Hulu

A theme that runs through a lot of the episodes is the relationship between mothers and daughters. And your own mom and daughter even appear in one episode. Why did you want to include them in the show?

The show highlights knowledge of culture being passed down from mothers to children because that's what actually happens in most homes, especially immigrant homes. It's the way that we connect our children to our culture the most. I felt it would have been hypocritical to ask other families and communities to be vulnerable and allow me to embed myself in their homes, in their kitchens and really ask some very deep, personal questions, without being willing to do that for my own family or life.

A lot of immigrant communities are very insular. And a lot of them don't want to talk about their own families or experiences because they have learned the hard way. They're embarrassed or they think that it's going to be ridiculed or used against them. And so asking these people -- some of whom also don't speak English fluently -- to expose themselves in this way was a big ask on my part. And because they trusted me, I needed to trust my audience. I needed to do that as well and not be guarded. And I think that the show is a success because of people's willingness to go out on a limb for me.

If you have a chance to do another season of ""Taste the Nation,"" what other kinds of food would you like to explore?

I'd love to go to Dearborn, Michigan, to talk to the different Arab communities there because, you know, there've been layers of immigration for the last 100 years, started by Henry Ford, who was looking for new factory workers for his auto plants.

I'd also love to go to Alaska. I shot in Alaska for a ""Top Chef"" finale years ago. And I loved it. And it's a really strange and beautiful place that not a lot of people on the mainland get to visit. And there's this huge Filipino community there. I'd really, really like to go in and discover that. The climate of Alaska year-round compared to the climate of the Philippines, that is very different. So I think that's an interesting look.

What is one thing you learned while filming ""Taste the Nation"" that really surprised you?

You know, in any food show -- ""Top Chef"" included, or ""Planet Food,"" or anything that I've done -- you always have one food that you're like, that was nice, but I don't need to eat that again. But I have to say, I did not come across that. I really, genuinely enjoyed all of the dishes I was introduced to, including the pack rat (which Lakshmi samples in the episode focusing on Native American cuisine). I was lucky, because I have no poker face.

Given all the things you learned making this show and all the many chapters of your life leading up to this moment, if you could talk to 4-year-old Padma right now or to 16-year-old Angelique, what would you tell her?",2020-07-12,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/padma-lakshmi-taste-the-nation-interview/index.html

The views expressed in this commentary are her own. Read more opinion on CNN.

(CNN) While the United States has been wrecked by domestic crises for most of 2020, the rest of the world hasn't stopped turning. Instead, many global threats -- like North Korea -- have grown in breadth and depth while the administration has scrambled to belatedly battle the Covid-19 pandemic and to deal with domestic divisions and the outcry over police brutality and systemic racism. Concurrently, while President Donald Trump has been waging a war on his perceived political enemies, tensions between China and India , two nuclear armed powers, have escalated with fatal consequences.

These twin conflicts in Asia present serious challenges for US national security at a time when the President seems mostly focused on attacking his former national security advisor , John Bolton, and saying whatever he thinks will score him campaign support. That approach forebodes a continued lack of any semblance of a coherent, informed strategy when it comes to dealing with security issues in Asia.

For years, Trump has treated North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Un, like a key foreign policy surrogate. He has inaccurately pointed to his relationship with Kim and small concessions North Korea made, like releasing prisoner remains , as a sign that he's made progress on North Korean denuclearization. Now, Trump's preferred foreign policy surrogate may be his biggest liability.

While Kim has continued to develop his illegal nuclear program and other conventional capabilities at a quick pace, despite summiting with Trump and becoming his preferred pen pal, North Korea has recently upped the ante on direct threats to the US and our allies.

Verbal insults are flying out of Pyongyang, including from Kim Jong Un's sister, Kim Yo-jong, who accused the President of South Korea, Moon Jae-in, of ""pro-US flunkeyism."" This is a far cry from the inter-Korean warmth displayed at Moon's previous summits with Kim Jong Un. Escalation on the Korean peninsula, where the US has thousands of troops stationed with their families, is a reality now. And, if Trump's past is prologue, there's no certainty that he'll side with our ally, South Korea, if Kim continues his dangerous behavior on the peninsula.

It was clear that denuclearization was nothing more than a pipe dream long ago -- and Kim has more recently publicly vowed to increase North Korea's nuclear ""deterrent."" Kim's not denuclearizing and may be backtracking on demilitarizing. The risk of direct, physical confrontation on the Korean peninsula is more of a reality as is a direct North Korean attack on US democracy.

While North Korea's destabilizing actions have only increased in the last few months -- they are clearly aware that Trump is desperate to cling to Kim as he heads into the election, and they may be trying to pressure him into giving Kim concessions to maintain some semblance of ""success"" with North Korea.

They know Trump prioritizes his political agenda over policy priorities, and they may be trying to provoke him into giving them what they want -- sanctions relief -- in exchange for cooling it during his campaign.

While Trump's administration figures out how to respond to the chaos created by Kim -- not to mention ongoing bilateral tensions with China -- there has also been a direct physical altercation between India and China. At least 20 Indian soldiers were killed on Monday in the Galwan Valley -- an area controlled by China but claimed by both countries. India and China went to war over this strip of land in 1962 after which a tenuous status quo has existed.

This isn't the first time those tensions have escalated, but the casualties earlier this week mark the bloodiest episode in Sino-Indian relations in decades as both countries have accused each other of not respecting the line of actual control (LAC) which serves as a de facto border. Both sides have reportedly militarily reinforced their positions in the area despite attempts to de-escalate tensions. While the strip of land in question is small and relatively inhospitable, it does hold strategic importance to both countries.

Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, has proven himself willing to stand up to China's regional ambitions. He's been clear that he won't let India be bullied by China . Furthermore, both leaders have politics at play -- backing down from a nationalist agenda item could come with costs for them at home. While Indian and Chinese officials met Thursday to discuss escalation, there are calls in India for retribution against China

And, while officials on both sides battle it out verbally, something's got to give because, as we have seen, the use of force is totally on the table. An off ramp is urgently needed because both countries are probably looking for a way out. Not only are they still battling Covid-19 and facing economic uncertainties, but they need an off ramp that allows them to save face domestically. Doing that will require careful diplomatic calibration in terms of concessions for any loss of life and a coordinated de-escalation of military assets in the area.

While the State Department tries to deal with Chinese aggression on multiple fronts, they also have to contend with the fact that Trump will say or do whatever he thinks is most politically expedient. Trump even undercut Pompeo on trade issues with China by tweeting on Thursday and he's been all over the map on other China-related issues like Hong Kong, the Uighurs and more.

These twin crises in Asia mean that during these final months of Trump's term, his track record on foreign policy is resoundingly clear. The President has exposed the US to more risks from North Korea, not less, while also turning the country into the weakest link when it comes to trying to resolve global conflicts. We have Trump to thank for all of that, and it's no wonder that leaders like Kim Jong Un and Xi Jinping think they can act with impunity.",2020-06-20,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/20/opinions/trump-china-india-asia-korea-vinograd/index.html
Analysis Nick Paton Walsh,Iran's Natanz nuclear facility fire raises questions,"(CNN) It is the world's most scrutinized shed. Exactly what happened to an outer building at an Iranian nuclear facility means both everything and nothing, as Tehran grapples with protecting its regional clout during the twin ravages of the coronavirus and US sanctions.

The Natanz nuclear plant lost a building when fire tore through it at 2:06 a.m. local time Thursday. Satellite images beefed up the photos from ground level that slowly led Iranian officials to switch from calling the damage at the facility ""limited"" to ""significant.""

The plant has a florid history: It was the target of Israel's Stuxnet cyber attack in 2010, an attack experts believe was carried out by Israel and the United States, and a focus of the uranium enrichment activity Iran has recently restarted at a higher level since the JCPOA (or nuclear deal) finally collapsed last year. This makes its even partial damage hard to simply dismiss as a broken generator in the summer heat.

The fire came in the middle of a series of unexplained incidents at other facilities. A huge blast hit near the town of Parchin and its military complex last month. Another explosion hit the Zargan power plant in Ahvaz over the weekend and hours later, a chlorine gas leak made dozens ill in southeast Iran. There is such a thing as coincidence, and sanctions mean maintenance issues can be more frequent. But the pattern just added to the speculation around Natanz.

Iran's on-the-record response -- which admitted nothing bar claiming to know the ""main cause"" -- perhaps was the most telling, that it would detail the cause when it suited. You might assess that a government dealing with economic difficulties, a persistent pandemic and crippling sanctions, would have preferred to sweep this incident under the carpet, were it just incompetence or an accident. Instead, it has chosen to amplify and prolong the suspicions.

Ipek Yezdani,Saudi consulate staff describe strange events on day of Khashoggi's death,"(CNN) Staff who worked at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul around the time of Jamal Khashoggi 's murder told a court Friday that they were told to stay away from the residence on the day the dissident journalist went missing in 2018.

A cleaning lady, two drivers, and a technical worker were all denied access or told not to show up to work on October 2, they said on the first day of the trial at a Turkish court.

Consulate technical worker Zeki Demir said he was initially told that there would be renovations at Consul General Mohammed al-Otaibi's home but was then asked to come in at 2 p.m.

""There were five or six people there. They stopped me from coming through the three entrances. They asked me to light up the tandoor (oven). There was an atmosphere of panic,"" he said.

""I lit up the tandoor and they spoke with each other. I joked saying that if you fall in the tandoor then you will become kebabs. Then I left.""

The Consul General's driver, Hakan Guven told the court that he took al-Otaibi and his family to the airport on October 8. Guven said al-Otaibi told him that he would return.

Their statements were included in the indictment, which lays out in detail the events leading up to the afternoon of October 2, when Khashoggi walked into the Saudi consulate in a busy business district in Istanbul to pick up papers that would have allowed him to marry his fiancée Hatice Cengiz. He never emerged.

Lawyers for the 20 Saudi defendants, assigned by Turkey's Bar Association for a fair trial, said they were unable to reach their clients.

The suspects named in the indictment include Ahmed al-Assiri, a former deputy head of Saudi Arabia's general intelligence, and Saud al-Qahtani, a former adviser to the Saudi Crown Prince. Both men are accused of ""instigating premeditated torturous murder with monstrous intent."" The remaining 18 defendants are being charged with ""premeditated torturous murder with monstrous intent.""

Cengiz, United Nations special rapporteur Agnes Callamard, representatives of International press Institute (IPI), European Federation of Journalist (EFJ) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) were all present at the trial on Friday.

Cengiz, who is hoping the case will offer new clues to the whereabouts of Khashoggi's remains, told journalists outside the court that the whole process was ""exhausting both spiritually and psychologically"" for her.

""It is a moral responsibility on our shoulders to pursue this murder,"" she said.

Hatice Cengiz hopes the case will offer new clues to the whereabouts of Jamal Khashoggi's remains.

She added that they will continue to seek justice both in Turkey and anywhere in the world.

Callamard, the UN special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary killings, said: ""We are sending a very strong message to dictators around the world that they cannot get away with killing a journalist.""

Saudi Arabia held a trial in December and found eight people guilty of charges relating to Khashoggi's death, but the proceedings were opaque and the defendants' identities were not revealed. Callamard said that hearing from the witnesses in this formal space would give ""far more legitimacy and strength to their statement.""

""We're moving into a space of justice. The Saudi process was anything but justice, it was a travesty of justice in my opinion and it was closed, secret trial. Here we have a space where the victims are heard in a way that they have never been heard before,"" she told media outside the court.

""It is important for truth telling because more information is coming up and more information will come up,"" she added.

Despite her findings that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman knew about the murder, he was not mentioned by name at the hearing, Callamard added.

""He was mentioned in a tangential fashion,"" she said.

She said she was unsure whether this was because of his diplomatic immunity or whether it was because the prosecution did not have enough evidence.

Ankara has repeatedly called for the suspects to be extradited and tried in Turkey where the crime took place. Riyadh has not complied with the request.

The Turkish indictment outlines a conspiracy among the defendants. It includes CCTV footage of the movement of the suspects — 15 of whom flew into Turkey from Saudi Arabia ahead of the killing — as well as eyewitness testimony from Turkish workers in the consulate who were given time off on the day of the murder.

The trial has brought fresh hope for Cengiz, who says she will not stop pursuing justice for her slain fiancée.

""I will continue to pursue all legal avenues to hold Jamal's killers accountable and I will not rest until we get Justice for Jamal,"" she said in a written statement to CNN. ""Jamal's killers and those who ordered his murder have evaded justice thus far. I hope this criminal case in Turkey brings to light the whereabouts of Jamal's body, the evidence against the killers and the evidence of those behind the gruesome murder.""

The Saudi government has presented shifting stories about Khashoggi's fate in the months following his death. Initially Saudi officials denied any knowledge of the journalist's whereabouts, then shifted to arguing that a group of rogue operators carried out the murder without the involvement of Bin Salman . Turkish officials have said Riyadh has not been cooperative in their investigation.

US officials, however, have said such a mission -- including the 15-man hit squad sent from Riyadh -- could not have been carried out without the authorization of Bin Salman, and the CIA concluded that the Crown Prince had ordered the killing. Saudi authorities have vehemently denied the allegations.

In December 2019, 11 unnamed suspects were put on trial in Saudi Arabi. Eight people were found guilty of charges related to Khashoggi's death, five of whom were sentenced to death. They were later pardoned by one of Khashoggi's sons, sparing them from the death penalty in accordance with Saudi legal custom.

Al-Qahtani and al-Assiri were cleared by Saudi authorities. Both men, part of the Crown Prince's inner circle , were relieved of their duties in the immediate aftermath of Khashoggi's killing.

In a report last year, Callamard concluded that Saudi Arabia was responsible under international law for the ""deliberate, premeditated execution"" of Khashoggi, and called for an investigation into the role of the Crown Prince, saying there was ""credible evidence meriting further investigation.""

Allyssia Alleyne,The fashion industry says it stands against racism. Critics aren't buying it,"Since May 26, headlines have been dominated by the killing of George Floyd and the international protests it has ignited. Thousands have taken to the streets around the world to denounce police brutality and anti-blackness, while online, thousands more have posted en masse in support of #BlackLivesMatter (BLM) and called for an end to systemic racism.

On social media, many fashion brands were quick to align themselves with protesters, posting black squares to Instagram on #BlackoutTuesday, and sharing lengthy captions denouncing racism, discrimination and violence. But not everyone was buying it.

""Plain and simple, I don't think there is the intention behind it to make long-lasting, sustainable change,"" Teen Vogue editor-in-chief Lindsay Peoples Wagner said in an email to CNN. ""Everyone can hop onto the BLM movement right now on social media, but what are you doing in your home, in your corporate office, with your connections, with the power you have?""

Charges of hypocrisy have plagued brands since the onset of the protests. On social media, commenters questioned whether the luxury brand Salvatore Ferragamo, who declined to comment for this story, could be an ally in the fight against racism when actor Tommy Dorfman accused them of discriminating against trans models and models of color in a recent campaign; or whether LA label Reformation could truly support #BlackLivesMatter when people claiming to be former employees were accusing the brand of workplace racism in the comments (founder Yael Aflalo has apologized and resigned from her post as chief executive officer); or whether Anthropologie could genuinely claim ""Our hearts, with yours, are breaking at current events,"" as they did in a since-deleted Instagram post, when they've been accused of racial profiling their customers -- allegations that the brand has denied

This is to say nothing of the backlash against fashion publications. Earlier this month, a CNN investigation unearthed numerous allegations of racism and workplace toxicity at Refinery29. In response to these accusations, editor-in-chief and co-founder Christene Barberich -- who resigned on June 8 -- said in a statement, ""My goal has always been to help close the representation gap and I believe that is reflected across the pages of Refinery29.""

Meanwhile, Anna Wintour was briefly rumored to be stepping down from her vaunted post at Vogue , as former staffers and talent shared their own experiences with racism at the magazine.

Wintour, whose official title names her as artistic director and editor-in-chief of Vogue US and global content advisor, sent an internal email to her staff on June 5. In the memo, seen by CNN, she acknowledged and took ""full responsibility"" for the racism that flourished under her watch: ""I know Vogue has not found enough ways to elevate and give space to Black editors, writers, photographers, designers and other creators. We have made mistakes too, publishing images or stories that have been hurtful or intolerant,"" she wrote.

Additionally, a spokesperson for Condé Nast, Vogue's publisher, said in a statement, ""Condé Nast is focused on creating meaningful, sustainable change and continues to implement an inclusive hiring process to ensure that a diverse range of candidates is considered for all open positions.""

It was French luxury brand Celine's Instagram response -- a black square with a caption reading, ""Celine stands against all forms of discrimination, oppression and racism. Tomorrow's world will not exist without equality for all #BlackLivesMatter"" -- that caused Hollywood stylist Jason Bolden, whose celebrity clients include Taraji P. Henson, Ava DuVernay and Serena Williams, to pause his scrolling. In a pointed comment that was later picked up by industry watchdog account Diet Prada , Bolden accused the brand, who declined to comment for this story, of not dressing Black celebrities for the red carpet unless they were working with White stylists.

""My focus has not been on fashion; my focus has been on lives being lost and the injustice (facing) Black people,"" Bolden said in a phone interview. ""But in that particular moment when I saw that go across my feed, it just sparked my rage. It just felt like a joke to me. It didn't feel authentic.""

As a stylist, Bolden said he's often felt marginalized by high fashion brands. He recalls struggling to find a designer to dress Henson for the 2017 Academy Awards, where her film ""Hidden Figures"" was nominated for three awards, including Best Picture. ""These are the exact same brands that I would see dressing talent who no one had ever heard of, and they were all White girls,"" said Bolden.

""And in those moments, what else are you supposed to lean into? (Henson) has everything they could possibly want. She has the press that goes along with (the Oscar nominations), she has the major coverage, she's presenting, she's won a Golden Globe... she's in critically acclaimed movies. And yet they said no.""

""I think what we're seeing is people like myself who are tired of people and brands not walking the talk,"" said Peoples Wagner. ""It's very easy for people to tap into a moment and say they care about an issue, but people have been doing that for years without making real systemic changes, and that's what's being demanded of brands now.""

This isn't the first time the fashion industry has stumbled when it comes to addressing issues of race. Cultural appropriation, high-profile racist gaffes and the lack of runway diversity are perennial talking points, leading to a recent wave of diversity and inclusion hires. Peoples Wagner is one of few Black editors at the helm of a major fashion magazine (along with British Vogue's Edward Enninful, and Harper's Bazaar's newly appointed editor, Samira Nasr , who will officially begin next month), and there are only two Black designers at the helm of European fashion houses.

""I don't know if any White person is even able to relate to the emotional turmoil that is being Black and trying to have a business here and trying to survive (in this industry)... I don't know if there's any sector in fashion where Black people can say we have the same resources, we're equal, we're treated the same,"" said model Adesuwa Aighewi , one of the most high-profile Black models working today.

Having walked the runway and fronted campaigns for some of the world's most renowned luxury brands and appeared on the April 2020 cover of Vogue, Aighewi said she sees her ""entire career"" as part of the industry's recent -- if still limited -- efforts to increase model diversity in magazines and on the runway after years of criticism. ""Literally everything that I've done has been as the face of my race and as a diversity token. I shot the cover of American Vogue in December, and yet I don't see any of the companies that so proudly paraded me around having meaningful dialogue about Black Lives Matter.""

Danielle Prescod, style director for BET.com, wasn't surprised to see brands suddenly speaking up against racism in the aftermath of Floyd's killing. ""(With) something that was moving as quickly as this movement was through social media, it would have been so glaring if people didn't say anything,"" she said.

“ Literally everything that I've done has been as the face of my race and as a diversity token. ” Adesuwa Aighewi

However, she couldn't help but question the motivation when brands that had previously remained silent on issues of race, or hadn't previously prioritized inclusion and diversity, chose this moment to speak up.

""It does come across as disingenuous when a brand says something like 'We stand with the Black community.' It's like, when have you ever stood with the Black community?"" she said. ""You have had the same opportunities to defend Black lives, to defend Black beauty, to employ Black people from the onset of your business. So for you this week to decide that you do (care about Black lives) is all too convenient. It ends up looking like a marketing opportunity rather than something that they truly care about.""

Indeed, now more than ever, aligning one's brand with popular causes can make for good strategy. According to the 2020 State of Fashion Report, compiled by management consulting giant McKinsey & Company and trade publication the Business of Fashion, almost two-thirds of consumers identify as ""'belief-driven buyers' who will choose, switch, avoid or boycott a brand based on its stand on societal issues."" Because of this, the report predicted that more companies will ""elevate diversity and inclusion as a higher priority.""

At a time when 74% of Americans support the protests, according to a recent Washington Post-Schar School poll, siding with protestors -- even in a superficial way -- means siding with popular opinion.

""If you look at how brands rally around causes, it's usually popular causes and the causes of the majority, because what you're trying to do is align your brand with customer values. So you now have a customer who judges your brand not as an entity, but as a person or personality,"" said Martin Raymond, co-founder of trend-forecasting consultancy The Future Laboratory.

""Traditionally, it was useful for brands to sit on the fence but, increasingly, if you sit on the fence, you risk getting splinters on your bottom. You end up not really understanding the pendulum of history and where it's swinging, and where you need to be when that pendulum passes over you.""

However, by aligning themselves with a cause, brands open themselves up to increased consumer scrutiny and criticism, which can be problematic when their pledges contradict their practices. Raymond points to the ongoing conversations around fashion brands' sustainability efforts, which have often been panned as ""greenwashing"": ""If I examined your infrastructure, your logistics chain or your sourcing -- particularly in fashion -- I would find quite strange things sitting there that would be readily available for criticism and for challenge.""

However, Bethann Hardison, a former model, turned modeling agent and diversity advocate, is less cynical. ""When people offer their solidarity, I don't tend to question it... I don't have time for that. We have a movement to keep moving,"" she said.

""These big companies, a lot of them are very good people and they do care to do the right thing, but they're used to being who they've been. Now, this is an opportunity for people to wake up and look and notice that something different is happening around them and happening to them.""

For brands who, historically, haven't had to think critically about race and social justice -- or address the issues of racism in their own teams -- a learning curve is to be expected. ""Some people are being challenged for the first time to talk about race openly.""

“ When people offer their solidarity, I don't tend to question it... I don't have time for that. We have a movement to keep moving ” Bethann Hardison

Some brands have been better at establishing solidarity than others. Bolden has praised Valentino designer Pierpaolo Piccioli for his multicultural casting and for making South Sudanese-Australian model Adut Akech the de facto face of the brand. Similarly, Prescod commends plus-size luxury e-retailer 11 Honoré for its commitment to using diverse models on their platform and on Instagram. (""You won't go two scrolls without seeing a Black face,"" Prescod observed.)

Hardison points to Gucci as an example of a brand making promising steps to address the lack of representation in fashion. In 2019, the Italian brand, which had faced backlash for insensitive designs and co-opting the designs of Black designer Dapper Dan, launched their Changemakers Impact Fund. Last October, the fund launched a $1.5 million diversity scholarship program to ""to ensure a new era of diverse and exceptional young people will gain opportunities and experiences across the fashion industry."" And, on June 3, the company announced it would be donating to the NAACP, Campaign Zero (a non-profit that works to end police brutality) and Colin Kaepernick's Know Your Rights Camp. Gucci also paused US operations on June 4 ""for employees to have a day of mourning, honor the lives lost, and recommit ourselves to being part of the solution.""

But truly entrenching anti-racist values into one's business requires dramatic change at the top, where decision-making power lies. In its 2019 report on inclusion and diversity in the industry, the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) stated that focusing on visibility -- such as diversity on the runway or on magazine covers -- is not enough: ""The industry must recognize and prioritize efforts to support greater diversity on the business side: the financiers, the chief executives, the heads of fashion houses, the senior level magazine editors, and business leaders,"" wrote Erica Lovett, the director of inclusion and diversity at publisher Condé Nast. ""Until fashion leaders across all categories become more diverse, we will continue to only progress at the surface level.""

Research suggests that diverse hiring is more than just a matter of good optics: it's good business. A 2018 McKinsey study found that companies with high levels of ethnic and cultural diversity on executive teams were 33% more likely to have ""industry-leading profitability.""

""People have been saying for years the steps that need to be taken: create a pipeline for BIPOC (Black, Indigenous and people of color) talent, make sure that pipeline gives way for leadership positions so you don't just have a ton of BIPOC assistants and freelancers, etc.,"" Peoples Wagner said. ""Inclusivity isn't as hard as people make it seem. It just has to be a committed, company-wide decision, and not a choice unilaterally.""

Hardison views this moment as ""a first step"" in a larger fight for change and predicts that today's unrest will lead to ""ample changes"" in the future. (She's not the only one: in a recent interview , civil rights activist and scholar Angela Davis said, ""This particular historical conjecture holds possibilities for change that we've never before experienced in this country."")

Aighewi is similarly optimistic but acknowledges that genuine change won't come easily. ""People need to actually do the work: get uncomfortable, have these conversations, admit that the system is not correct,"" she said.

""These companies have been around long enough. This is not the first time Black people have complained about the fashion industry; this isn't the first revolution. Something's got to give.""",2020-07-12,https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/fashion-industry-black-lives-matter/index.html
Oscar Holland,Francis Bacon painting sells for $84M at first-of-its-kind virtual auction,"Written by Oscar Holland, CNN

Francis Bacon triptych sold for over $84 million during a virtual auction at Sotheby's, on what was an encouraging -- and highly unusual -- evening for the coronavirus-hit art market.

With an auctioneer live-streaming from London, and telephone bids beamed in from New York and Hong Kong, the painter's 1981 artwork ""Triptych Inspired by the Oresteia of Aeschylus"" exceeded pre-sale estimates of between $60 million and $80 million.

Monday evening's marathon sale marked the first time that Sotheby's has trialed its ""hybrid"" auction format, which saw chairman of Sotheby's Europe, Oliver Barker, taking bids from agents around the world via a wall of screens. In a press statement Barker described the experience as ""like being at the epicenter of a cinematic production.""

Bidders were also able to make offers online, with the 10-minute battle for Bacon's painting ending in a two-horse race between a web user in China and an unidentified telephone bidder. The final price tag of $84.6 million, offered by the latter, marks the third-highest sum ever paid for the artist's work at auction, according to Sotheby's.

There were other positive signs at the evening event, which consisted of three separate sales. Roy Lichtenstein's ""White Brushstroke I"" went for $25.4 million, while Jean-Michel Basquiat 's ""Untitled (Head)"" achieved $15.2 million, a new world auction record for a work on paper by the artist.

The evening generated a total of $363.2 million for Sotheby's, with 93% of the artworks offered eventually selling. According to Gregoire Billault, head of the auction house's contemporary art department in New York, it bodes well for the coming months.

""Tonight was a very clear demonstration that, even in very difficult times, if you come up with the right (artworks) at the right prices, the market is there,"" he said over the phone shortly after the sale, admitting that staging the auction in the current climate had been ""a risk.""

""It's definitely going to influence what we're going to do in the future,"" he added. ""Whether we're going to repeat (this exact format) I don't know, but we know it's possible and that it works.""

Difficulties remain

Yet, these remain troubling times for an industry that has been severely hampered by the inability to stage live sales. With lockdowns around the world forcing auction houses to cancel and postpone events, Sotheby's has already furloughed and laid off staff amid a collapse in revenues.

Despite efforts to boost digital offerings in recent months, the top end of the art market is still heavily dependent on live sales and in-person viewings. Proceeds from online-only auctions represent relative pocket-change for the big houses -- just $80 million of the total $4.8 billion generated by Sotheby's in 2019 came via the web.

How do art auctions really work?

The auction house has, nonetheless, made efforts to compensate for the lack of physical events. Its ""Contemporary"" sale set a new online record in April when it generated more than $6.4 million through works by the likes of Andy Warhol and Damien Hirst. The $1.3 million paid for George Condo's ""Antipodal Reunion"" may have represented just a fraction of the sums seen on Monday evening, but it was the most Sotheby's has ever raised for an artwork through online-only bidding.

But while the apparent success of this ""hybrid"" auction will no doubt come as a relief, there remain questions around the appetite for blue-chip art amid a global economic downturn. Moreover, the Bacon painting was consigned long before the pandemic took hold in the West, meaning that potential buyers were able to view the artwork up close in Hong Kong and London prior to the sale.

Whether potential sellers will still want to put multi-million-dollar art on sale in the current climate -- or whether buyers will splash out on big-ticket items they cannot inspect in person -- remains to be seen.

Billault nonetheless struck an upbeat chord, saying that Sotheby's had still been able ""to consign amazing works during the Covid period.""

""We have sent a signal to the art market after all these difficult times, with fairs canceled and museums closed,"" he said, adding: ""It's a vote of confidence both for sellers and buyers.""

Helen Jennings,Vintage family pictures inspired this Nigerian photographer's latest work,"Written by Helen Jennings, CNN

For his latest project, Nigerian photographer Oye Diran looked to his old family photos for inspiration. He was especially taken by the elegant clothing his parents used to wear, including his mother in classic Nigerian iro and buba style (a wrapped skirt and tailored top) -- often paired with a gele (headwrap).

""I was struck by how appealing and rich these outfits looked and was reminded of how well my parents and their friends were attired when I was young,"" Diran wrote over email from where he now lives in New York. ""The relevance of iro and buba doesn't dissipate over time, so I came up with this story to shed light on the beauty of my heritage to the world.""

Diran went on to research more imagery from Nigeria in the 1960s to 1980s, before recreating the same vintage feeling for ""A Ti De"" (""We Have Arrived""), featuring portraits of three women dancing, posing and having a good time. ""Yoruba people are known to find any reason to dress up and celebrate,"" he said, referring to Nigeria's second-largest ethnic group. ""Traditional weddings, for example, are an opportunity to wear your finest iro and buba, add accessories, and show out,"" he said.

From the optimism that followed independence from Britain in 1960, through a devastating civil war and subsequent military coups, the period that this project draws from was a seismic and formative one for Nigeria. This was reflected in the country's cultural landscape and ideas around dress. While Fela Kuti incited rebellion and preached pan-Africanism, Lagos' most stylish residents mixed up local fashion with western silhouettes. This speaks to today's Nigerian image-makers, who draw on the past to comment on neo-colonialism and redefine black beauty, such as Lakin Ogunbanwo , Ruth Ossai and Diran.

Diran originally studied business and worked in event production before finding his calling as a photographer a decade ago. He taught himself the skill and has gone on to hone a minimalist yet warm aesthetic, citing renowned West African photographers J.D. Okhai Ojeikere , Malick Sidibé and Seydou Keïta as influences. ""These legends depicted the excellence of their culture. I'm inspired by the set designs, styling and conceptual poses of their portraits.""

Ojeikere's celebrated archive documenting the intricate hairstyles and headwear of Nigerian women is echoed not only in ""A Ti De,"" but Diran's ongoing series ""Gele,"" which captures regal matriarchs in opulent settings with elaborately tied headwraps acting as their crowns. ""I began the series in 2017 as a way to interpret the symbolic meaning of geles and express the splendour of African women,"" he said.

Diran's fashion and art photos have featured in both Vogue Italia and Afropunk, and his work was included in an exhibition at the United Nations in 2018. This year, his photo ""Makub,"" featuring a woman's delicate face and hands in an infinite pastel pink expanse, won a LensCulture Exposure award. ""'Maktub' is an Arabic word meaning 'it is written'. It is the idea that our destinies are pre-ordained but still have to be pursued,"" he said.

Since it debuted in March on global African media platform Nataal , Diran has received plenty of responses to ""A Ti De,"" and its nostalgic appeal. ""The feedback has been overwhelmingly positive from Nigerians at home and across the diaspora,"" he said.

""People have expressed a sense of pride, inspiration and empowerment that the project has given them."" This ties into Diran's wider sense of duty to create images that speak to a positive, pan-African perspective.

""I want to continue to convey the essence of African or black ideologies while breaking down misconstrued narratives of these cultures,"" he said. ""I want to be part of the global force illuminating the culture from a diasporic perspective. And most importantly, telling the many truths that are overlooked and more often, silenced. I feel that it is our collective responsibility as African photographers to do so.""",2020-07-12,https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/a-ti-de-oye-diran-photography/index.html
Ananda Pellerin,Remember when the women of Twin Peaks made nostalgia new again?,"Written by Ananda Pellerin, CNN

Before Netflix, before sagas like ""Game of Thrones"" -- before high-speed internet -- there was ""Twin Peaks.""

It's not a stretch to say that without ""Twin Peaks,"" there would be no ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" no ""Riverdale,"" and, arguably, no ""Gilmore Girls."" Setting the blueprint for edgy TV drama, David Lynch's trailblazing police procedural, which first aired 30 years ago on April 8, 1990, brought gothic Americana into the mainstream.

Equal parts ""Twilight Zone"" and ""Dynasty,"" ""Twin Peaks"" was a departure from the conventional plot lines of popular prime-time dramas like ""L.A. Law"" and ""MacGyver."" Its legacy transcends its short run (two seasons, until a third was released in 2017) and cult status, creeping onto the covers of Time and Rolling Stone, and into water cooler conversations around the world.

But it wasn't only the unsolved mystery of who killed homecoming queen Laura Palmer that kept viewers coming back to the haunting -- and haunted -- West Coast town, teeming with backstabbing, sexual escapades and a fabled ""darkness"" lurking in the nearby woods. Shot on film, the show had a cinematic feel that was unusual for TV at the time, with Lynch's signature psychosexual surrealism (seen in earlier indie releases like ""Blue Velvet"" and ""Eraserhead"") ratcheting up the tension of each visually and emotionally saturated scene.

This tone owes a huge debt to the show's costuming, helmed by long-time Lynch collaborator Patricia Norris. Simple staples from decades past were updated and worn with modern ease, while trends that would define the next decade could be glimpsed in their infancy, making ""Twin Peaks"" a period piece outside time.

There was no shortage of compelling characters with distinct looks. From coffee-obsessed FBI special agent Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) in his beige trench coat and brill-creamed officer's cut, to Hawaiian shirted psychiatrist Dr Jacoby (Russ Tamblyn), to the all-seeing Log Lady (Catherine E Coulson) in her red-framed glasses.

The women in particular embodied the town's twin spirits of repression and desire, and none more than pot-stirring teenager Audrey Horne (Sherilyn Fenn). The daughter of scheming businessman Benjamin Horne, Audrey is bored, imaginative, and doesn't care what anyone thinks. When we first find her sulking around her father's wood-paneled Great Northern Hotel, eagerly terrifying a group of Norwegian businessmen with her morbid recounting of the recent town killing, she epitomizes 1950s girlhood in saddle shoes and a pink angora sweater, tucked into a plaid skirt.

It comes as no surprise, then, when we later see Audrey trading her flats for red kitten heels stashed in her school locker, or cooly smoking in the girls' bathroom, with her A-frame eyebrows and figure-hugging sweater, setting the type of scene that pushed lobbyists to pressure Hollywood to stop letting actors smoke on screen -- because it just looked too good. Or, in a moment that made TV history, Audrey, poured into a svelte little black dress, twists a cherry stem into a knot with her tongue.

Veronica on ""Riverdale"" is an obvious heir to Audrey's teen vamp persona, but so, too, is '90s Courtney Love, with her broken-down pin-up look; the independent and spirited Rory and Lorelai of ""Gilmore Girls,"" with some jeans and MAC lipstick thrown in; and ""Glee""'s gutsy and seductive cheerleader Santana.

At the other end of the mid-century spectrum is Donna, the town doctor's good-hearted daughter, cut from the finest girl-next-door cloth. Even as she breaks into tears in the middle of class, suddenly aware that something terrible has happened to her best friend Laura, it's hard not to be distracted by her impeccably manicured nails.

But Lynch's nostalgia didn't end with the 1950s. Norma, owner of the Double R diner (played by Peggy Lipton of ""Bewitched"" and ""The Mod Squad"" fame) updates the working-class diner look on ""Alice,"" which ran from 1974 until 1985, bringing the elegance of a ballgown to her blue-and-white uniform, replete with integrated apron and leg-of-mutton sleeves.

Similarly, Josie Packard (Joan Chen), the phenomenally chic widow of the town's previous mill owner, exudes pure glamour. With immaculately red-stained lips and crop of jet-black hair, she bridges the gap between 1980s power suits and the more relaxed tailoring that would take hold in the '90s. Josie always looks straight off the runway, whether she's donning a green silk bathrobe, a red sweater dress, or high-waisted check trousers paired with a structural brown cardigan (arguably the best outfit in the series).

There were only eight episodes in the first season of Twin Peaks, but it was enough to set off the 1990s on a stylish, precient note. The wool sweaters, wool cardigans, wool tights, A-line skirts and plaid, plaid, plaid would soon after be reflected in Seattle grunge and ""Clueless"" cuteness , while the show's lack of fashion accessories and short hair on women would become part of the decade's minimalist style code.

And while season two was full of its own pleasant surprises -- DEA agent and trans woman Denise Bryson, played by David Duchovny, arrives in town -- and the reboot gave fans a long overdue hit of small-town weirdness, 30 years on there remains something special about those first eight episodes, a magical quality that has yet to be replicated.",2020-07-12,https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/remember-when-twin-peaks-david-lynch/index.html
Jacqui Palumbo,"Empowering, alluring, degenerate? The evolution of red lipstick","Written by Jacqui Palumbo, CNN

CNN Style has launched a dedicated Beauty section. Read more Beauty stories here.

In 1912 thousands of supporters of the suffrage movement marched past the New York salon of Elizabeth Arden. The cosmetics brand founder, who had just opened her business two years earlier, was a supporter of women's rights, and she aligned herself with the cause by handing out tubes of bright red lipstick to the marching women.

Suffrage leaders Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Charlotte Perkins Gilman loved red lipstick for its ability to shock men, and protesters donned the bold color en masse, adopting it as a sign of rebellion and liberation.

""There could not be a more perfect symbol of suffragettes than red lipstick, because it's not just powerful, it's female,"" said Rachel Felder, author of last year's ""Red Lipstick: An Ode to a Beauty Icon,"" in a phone interview. ""Suffragettes were about female strength, not just strength.""

Throughout the centuries red lipstick has signaled many things, from its early use by the elite in ancient Egypt and by prostitutes in ancient Greece, to its status in early Hollywood as a symbol of glamor. In its many hues, this color on lips has been a mighty cultural weapon, charged with thousands of centuries of meaning. ""Red lipstick is truly a way to trace cultural history and societal zeitgeist,"" Felder said.

Until lipstick was popularized in the early 20th century, red lips were often associated with morally dubious women: impolite, sexually amoral, even heretical. In the Dark Ages, red lips were seen as a sign of commingling with the devil. The makeup ""was associated with this mysterious, frightening femininity,"" Felder said.

Then, Felder's book explains, as the American suffrage movement adopted red lips, their international counterparts did, too.

As women's rights movements spread across Europe, New Zealand and Australia, with British and American organizers often sharing tactics, from organizing marches, to hunger strikes, to more aggressive militant strategies. And this solidarity extended to their makeup. Inspired by her American counterparts, British suffragette leader Emmeline Pankhurst favored a red lip, which helped spread the symbolic gesture among her fellow activists.

Though suffragettes popularized the red-lip look in their day, Felder notes that there was already momentum to normalize lipstick among women more generally, as they dropped restrictive corsets for brassieres, and started to adopt more streamlined silhouettes, designed by the likes of Coco Chanel.

After the suffragettes wore red lipstick, the exuberant flappers of the Roaring Twenties followed suit. And while suffragettes may not have been solely responsible for popularizing a painted lip, they embodied the idea of the ""modern woman"" in Europe and America, Felder pointed out.

During World War II, red lips had their bold second act of defiance. Adolf Hitler ""famously hated red lipstick,"" Felder said. In Allied countries, wearing it became a sign of patriotism and a statement against facism. When taxes made lipstick prohibitively expensive in the UK, women stained their lips with beet juice instead.

As men went off to war and women filled their professional roles back home, they donned red lips to enter the workforce. It showed their resilience in the face of conflict, Felder explained, and offered a sense of normalcy in difficult times. ""It allowed women to retain a sense of their own self-identity from before the war."" J. Howard Miller's illustration of Rosie the Riveter, the cultural icon who was used to recruit and empower American female factory workers, notably had cherry-daubed lips.

In 1941 and for the duration of the war, red lipstick became mandatory for women who joined the US Army. Beauty brands had capitalized on the wartime trend, with Elizabeth Arden releasing ""Victory Red"" and Helena Rubenstein introducing ""Regimental Red,"" among others. But it was Arden who the American government asked to create a regulation lip and nail color for serving women. Her ""Montezuma Red"" matched and accentuated their uniforms' red piping.

""Wearing red lipstick for a woman in that era was so linked to... a sense of feminine self-esteem,"" particularly, ""resilient and strong female self-esteem,"" said Felder, who has herself worn the beauty staple nearly every day since high school. After the war, classic Hollywood actresses like Elizabeth Taylor added a layer of glamour to the confident look.

Today, other protest symbols for women's empowerment have become widespread, notably the pink pussy hat that dominated the 2017 Women's March; and the habit from ""The Handmaid's Tale"" which has been worn internationally for women's causes, including pro-choice demonstrations.

Yet red lips still pack a punch. In a viral image from 2015, a Macedonian woman kissed an officer's riot shield during an anti-government protest, leaving a red kiss mark in a poignant moment of rebellion.

In 2018 in Nicaragua, women and men wore red lipstick and uploaded photos of themselves to social media to show their support for the release of anti-government protesters. They were reacting to activist Marlén Chow, who defied her interrogators by applying red lipstick.

Last December, nearly 10,000 women in Chile took to the streets wearing black blindfolds, red scarves, and red lips to denounce sexual violence in the country.

By wearing red lips, protesters all over the world have tapped into the same power the suffrage movement once plumbed a century earlier. In this bold, defiant beauty statement, their legacy lives on.

Craigh Barboza,These films explore black lives impacted by white authority,"Written by Craigh Barboza

Craigh Barboza teaches film journalism at New York University and writes about race, entertainment and culture.

Following the wave of demonstrations sparked by the killing of George Floyd, many of us have been thinking about the history of race in America, and the ongoing narrative of police violence. We are all looking for resources to help better understand the moment.

Each of the movies below offers a different perspective on how African Americans have contended with white authority over the decades and centuries. They both speak to and echo what is happening now.

The films range from underground classics to big-studio productions, all of which put a human face on timely and difficult social justice issues that have shifted the conversation on racial equality in America in a way that only movies can do.

If you've seen the films on this list, you can rewatch them in a new light. And if it's your first time, you might recognize something that resonates with the hundreds of Black Lives Matter and anti-racism protests that have erupted worldwide calling for wide-reaching reform.

""Harriet"" (2019)

""Harriet"" Credit: Martin Chase Productions

Kasi Lemmons' recent biopic portrays the famed abolitionist Harriet Tubman (Cynthia Erivo) as a young, gun-toting heroine prepared to die for the freedom of her people. Starting out in 1849, ""Harriet"" explores the monstrous institution of slavery and how it seeped into American law enforcement in the form of marshals and paid trackers -- sometimes seen as glorified slave catchers.

""What you see in the movie are these armed posses that are after black people,"" said Donald Bogle, the film historian and author of ""Hollywood Black,"" via email.

""There's that sequence on the bridge when Harriet is cornered, after an escape, and she says, 'I'm going to be free or die' and jumps into the river. I think we can draw a connection to what's happening today and a system of pursuers, these violent white men who, in some ways, are sanctioned to murder us.""

""Harriet"" Credit: IMDB

Erivo's breakout performance as Tubman (she was a double-Oscar nominee last year for best actress and original song) is worth the price of streaming alone. After making it to Philadelphia, she joins the Underground Railroad, where she becomes its most famous conductor. We learn about the prophetic visions that helped her lead approximately 70 enslaved people to freedom, as well as Tubman's command of a black army that freed 150 more in the Combahee River Raid.

""Harriet"" underscores the important role African American women have played in history, and how they continue to suffer discrimination and persecution. ""We've had these instances, like Sandra Bland, who was stopped by the cops for something so minor and, we have it on film -- the way the cop spoke to her and she spoke back -- and she was taken into custody and ended up dead ,"" Bogle said. ""There's this idea that this whole system violates African American men but it can do this to African American women as well.""

""Rosewood"" (1997)

""Rosewood"" Credit: Warner Bros.

John Singleton's ""Rosewood"" tells the true story of how, in 1923, a prosperous black town in Florida was burned to the ground. The fuse was lit by a white woman (played by Catherine Kellner) who falsely claimed that she was raped by a black stranger -- a story whipped up to explain the bruises inflicted by her extramarital lover. Throw in some trumped-up talk of a race riot by one of the local officials and it's not long before a group of Klansmen are swarming the town in search of a mysterious black war veteran (played by Ving Rhames).

The result is a week-long massacre of torture, shootings and lynchings that Singleton shows in grisly ways on a scale that had never been done before in movies depicting slavery or its legacy. Survivors, many of them children, fled through the nearby swamps. The official death toll was eight, although many believe the final number was much higher. ""'Rosewood' effectively captured the real-life horror of racism,"" said the activist and author Dr. Umar Johnson in an email. ""The lynchings of thousands of African Americans, from the end of slavery in 1865 until the death of Malcolm X in 1965, shows just how inhumane White America can be.""

The film is a powerful reminder that black lives, even entire communities, can be destroyed when someone ""weaponizes [their] whiteness,"" as the cultural critic Roxane Gay recently put it in reference to the news last month of a white woman who called the cops on a black birder in New York's Central Park after he asked her to leash her dog, which is the law. (The call was made on the same day that George Floyd was killed.)

""Selma"" (2014)

Real change in society has often been the result of a political alliance between inside and outside forces. In addition to a citizen-based movement it's necessary to have government operatives or, even better, leaders like Martin Luther King who can stir the people in power to change laws.

As the central figure in ""Selma,"" King (David Oyelowo) is a virtuoso combination of grace, intelligence, rhetorical power and persistence. In an early scene inside the Oval Office, he implores a reluctant President Lyndon Johnson (Tom Wilkinson) to push through the Voting Rights Act of 1965, intended to dismantle barriers that had been put in place to stop some black citizens from voting. Without it, he explains, African Americans would not have the same legal rights, but would continue to be murdered by white people, who would either be protected by white officials or acquitted by all-white juries. ""All white,"" King says, ""because you can't serve on a jury unless you're registered to vote."" Told he'll have to wait, King organizes a massive voting rights demonstration in the South.

The scenes in Ava DuVernay's protest drama are played in a stately, but intimate style. The most powerful images are of the scores of activists marching peacefully through the segregated streets of Alabama. ""Ava's film reminds people that no change has ever happened in America without a movement, and struggle, and that it is never easy,"" said writer-activist Kevin Powell, whose new book of essays, ""When We Free The World,"" is out later this month.

You can feel what it must have been like to be on the front lines -- along with would-be voters (Oprah Winfrey, LaKeith Stanfield) and future Congressman John Lewis (Stephan James) -- standing up to a horde of state troopers brandishing rifles, electric cattle prods and whips.

""Selma"" went on to win an Oscar for best original song (""Glory"" by Common and John Legend) and is the rare studio movie directed by an African American woman.

The film is set around the march on Bloody Sunday in 1965, and the maneuverings and events leading up to it, including the church bombing that killed four little girls in Birmingham, which was a major turning point in the civil rights movement.

""'Selma' is a case study in leadership,"" added Powell. ""It's actually a blessing to have a film to point people to as a teaching tool, to root folks in history, so they understand this is not just for us now, but for those not yet born.""

""Boyz N the Hood"" (1991)

Gang violence was visible on the nightly news and MTV when this searing drama about the challenges black men face while growing up in South Central Los Angeles arrived in 1991.

""Boyz N the Hood"" was by no means the first film to tackle the subject. But it had often been done poorly: for instance, when the story is told from the perspective of the cops -- see ""Colors."" (Better yet, don't!) ""Boyz N the Hood,"" on the other hand, was notable not just for its nuanced, insider's perspective of black life on the margins, but for who was behind the camera. John Singleton was fresh out of USC film school when he became part of a new generation of black filmmakers in Hollywood to find success with mainstream audiences.

In his semi-autobiographical debut, Singleton used the structure of a coming-of-age tale to show what it's like to live in a world where a trip to the corner store could end in a homicide by shotgun. The film earned him two Oscar nominations, for writing and directing, and also introduced several future stars, including Cuba Gooding Jr., Regina King and Ice Cube, who had recently launched a solo rap career after parting with the gangsta rap group N.W.A.

One of the most contemptible characters in ""Boyz N the Hood"" is a black police officer (Jessie Lawrence Ferguson) who responds an hour late to a 9-1-1 call by the main character's father, Furious (Larry Fishburne).

""Homeboy shows up drinking a cup of coffee,"" said director Malcolm Lee, whose movies include ""Undercover Brother"" and the upcoming ""Space Jam: A New Legacy.""

""He feels he's better than hood Negroes because he's in law enforcement, and thinks the world would be better if Furious had killed the intruder,"" Lee said via email. ""He says, 'It'd be one less n**ga out on the streets we'd have to worry about.'""

Years later Furious's college-bound son, Tre (Gooding), is driving home at night when he's stopped by that same officer, who mistakes Tre for a possible gangbanger. Hot-headed and volatile, the cop draws his Smith & Wesson and threatens to blow Tre's head off. We watch as a single tear trickles down Tre's face. In his anguish you can sense the trauma many black people experience after encounters with the police.

""Serpico"" (1973)

Last week former President Barack Obama called on local governments in the U.S. to embrace police accountability and said that, in his view, the ""vast majority"" of police officers are not violent. But the fact is that good cops can sometimes find themselves ostracized if they break rank.

One of the first films to give us a realistic glimpse into life on the force was ""Serpico,"" with Al Pacino in the title role, an incorruptible detective with a fondness for wild disguises. The fact-based thriller not only turned Pacino into a star when it was released in 1973, it also depicted an out-of-control big-city police department where dirty, racist cops work over perps and take bribes from gamblers and drug dealers.

""Hey, Frank, you want a piece of this?"" asks one cop, who's assaulting a black suspect. ""No, I'm going to fill out the police card,"" Serpico replies.

""'Serpico' is a really powerful depiction of how hard it is to reform policing,"" said Touré, the writer and host of the podcast Touré Show, featuring in-depth interviews with successful black people. ""It shows how much the police will fight against those who demand more from them. The real-life Serpico risked his life to expose wrongdoing.""

At first, Serpico is persuaded, then repeatedly pressured, by fellow officers to ""go along,"" before he blows the whistle on graft and corruption in the department. High-ranking city officials reportedly tried to block the investigation, which blew the lid on the documented "" code of silence ,"" or blue wall, that many precincts are accused of maintaining.

""The police don't want to be policed!"" said Touré, who believes that it is how you end up with three other officers standing by as Derek Chauvin dug his knee into George Floyd's neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds. ""It rips at the core of (the police's) culture.""

""Do The Right Thing"" (1989)

New York's police force also played a critical part in Spike Lee's infernal of race, class and power in 1980s Brooklyn. Dedicated to the families of several black city residents who have died at the hands of police officers, including Michael Stewart (killed in custody in 1983 after graffitiing a subway wall), and Eleanor Bumpurs (shot twice a year later while being evicted from her public housing apartment), this controversial classic established Lee as a major director and unofficial spokesperson for the African American community.

He wrote, starred in and directed ""Do The Right Thing."" The film, which is set up like a play featuring a collage of different voices, tries to show how unchecked racism and xenophobia can fester within a community because of economic inequality and intense social divisions. We get a parade of confrontational scenes between the multi-ethnic cast, which included Danny Aiello, Giancarlo Esposito, Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee and Rosie Perez in her first role, all doing vivid characterizations.

The premise is simple: a slice-of-life film set on one block on the hottest day of the year. The climax is a neighborhood riot, triggered by the killing of a black man by the NYPD. The images of Brooklynites clashing with police and vandalizing a storefront look like they could've been ripped from the current protests. The soundtrack is Public Enemy's ""Fight the Power,"" which plays throughout the film.

On June 1, Lee, who won the Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar in 2019 for his film ""BlacKkKlansman,"" posted a short film on Twitter called ""3 Brothers"" (he debuted it on a CNN special report with Don Lemon), that intercuts cameraphone footage of Eric Garner (a police officer was accused of Garner's death after choking him in 2014 ), and George Floyd, with a scene from ""Do The Right Thing,"" in which Radio Raheem (Bill Nunn) dies in a police chokehold. The short starts with the words, ""Will History Stop Repeating Itself?""

""Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song"" (1971)

""Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song"" Credit: IMDB

Many of the people who have turned out in droves at recent protests have expressed their anger at police violence -- some have themselves clashed with baton-swinging police or have been tear-gassed or hit by rubber bullets -- and they are ready to take action. That's the kind of story Melvin Van Peebles set out to tell in ""Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song,"" a scrappy independent film from 1971 that made a then-impressive $10 million at the box office.

The tough but silent protagonist here is played by Van Peebles, who also served as writer, director, composer and editor. In sharp contrast to previous black stars like Sidney Poitier and Harry Belafonte (whose characters were often neutered), Sweetback is a sexual dynamo with the ladies. For the first ten minutes, the film feels flamboyantly risque. Then Sweetback becomes radicalized -- has a full-on political awakening-- after witnessing two white officers brutalizing an innocent black militant. He intervenes, saving the brother, but kills the cops in the process. At that point the film begins to feel like a Molotav cocktail to white authority.

""Van Peebles' film was groundbreaking for its depiction of Sweetback's blatant sexuality, which poses a threat to the system,"" said film and TV producer Stephanie Allain, a longtime advocate for equity and inclusion in Hollywood, and whose credits include ""Dear White People"" and last year's Oscars telecast.

""But his cop killing separates him from society and puts him on the run, probably forever. To me, it's a statement that black male strength is frightening to 'the man.' And it still is.""

""Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song"" was the first movie to reflect the politics of the Black Arts Movement, one tenet of which is for black people to promote empowering images of themselves in the media. And with its funk-soul soundtrack and shots of the black community aiding Sweetback, as he runs for his freedom, the film also seemed to hint at a grassroots revolution in cinema. It was, and it wasn't.

While Van Peebles did introduce a defiant new hero who triumphed over a brutal white power structure, paving the way for the blaxploitation era of the 1970s (which at its unprecedented peak saw more than 40 black-themed movies produced over a two-year span), few films since have matched its cultural resonance.

""Queen & Slim"" (2019)

If Sweetback had any offspring they would be ""Queen & Slim."" The title characters in this intriguing drama from 2019 start out at an Ohio diner, where they are on an awkward first date. She (Jodie Turner-Smith) is a black defense attorney; he (Daniel Kaluuya) works at Costco. While heading home their car is arbitrarily pulled over by a racist police officer. A scuffle ensues and they shoot and kill him in self-defense. Shell shocked, they flee the scene.

The comparisons to ""Bonnie and Clyde"" are unavoidable. (""Well, if it isn't the black Bonnie and Clyde,"" says one of the characters.) Like that classic about the real-life, white, Depression-era bank robbers, ""Queen & Slim"" has outlaws who fall in love while eluding the authorities and become accidental folk heroes, in this case, because of a viral video of the officer's dashcam footage.

But whereas the thrill-seeking and sex-starved antiheroes in ""Bonnie and Clyde"" were excited to see their pictures in the paper, Queen and Slim are just the opposite. They are on the lam because of the same police abuse and systemic injustice that have ignited the current protests.

By making a terrifying menace out of what is assumed to be a protective force -- the police -- the filmmakers have created an audacious, lyrical film that should be required viewing for anyone who wants to understand the grief and rage of the Black Lives Matter generation.

""Queen & Slim"" was the work of director Melina Matsoukas, a young woman of color on the rise whose stylistic music videos for Beyoncé have mixed documentary and fantasy elements, and ""The Chi"" TV series creator and LGBTQ activist Lena Waithe, who called her original script ""protest art.""

The filmmakers said the goal with ""Queen & Slim"" was to realistically portray what it means to be African American today, where you feel the need to regularly contemplate your own mortality, in hopes that you don't become the next hashtag, while following your own path to happiness. One criticism of the movie, however, is that it might be a little too real, or not optimistic enough anyway.

""'Queen & Slim' was very powerful and effectively communicated the psychological and emotional conflicts that exist within the black community toward the police,"" Dr. Umar Johnson said. ""On another level, I feel that the movie did a disservice to the black liberation struggle by not allowing the two protagonists to escape. It reinforced the idea that we can never successfully revolt against the white police power structure.""

That may be what the film says, but then, new scripts are being written every day.",2020-07-12,https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/african-american-movies-white-authority-protests/index.html
Monica Sarkar,Why does Bollywood use the offensive practice of brownface in movies?,"Monica Sarkar , CNN Written by

Bollywood may be best known for its glamorous casts, glitzy costumes and energetic dance routines. But it also has a far less flattering reputation -- for promoting the offensive practice of brownface.

""It's actually racism,"" said award-winning film director Neeraj Ghaywan. ""Let's not mince our words.""

In the United States, the concepts of blackface and brownface date back to the 19th century , when white performers would darken their faces with makeup, and use racist stereotypes to portray black and other ethnic minority characters. White performers did this in a time when non-white professionals were themselves barred from employment in the industry.

And the practice dates back even further in England, to the Elizabethan era, when directors traditionally cast white actors to play minority characters in Shakespearean plays. Even into recent decades, the African general in ""Othello"" has long been played by a white actor with darkened skin, including Orson Welles in 1951 and Laurence Olivier in 1965.

It's also appeared in modern films. Dan Aykroyd wore blackface and dreadlocks in 1983's ""Trading Places,"" and Robert Downey Jr. appeared several shades darker in 2008's ""Tropic Thunder,"" to play a white Australian method actor who darkened his skin to play a black man in a Vietnam war film.

Bollywood has adopted brownface in a number of films -- by temporarily darkening the skin of performers, especially when they are portraying characters from disadvantaged backgrounds.

As in the early days of Hollywood, critics of this practice say that Bollywood often prefers this approach to actually hiring performers who have naturally darker skin, thus perpetuating discrimination and inequality in the industry.

For example, the popular 2019 film ""Bala"" featured the story of a woman who suffered discrimination on the basis of her skin tone.

The woman was played by famed actress Bhumi Pednekar (pictured above), who had her skin darkened in order to play the role. The move was slammed by some Indian media outlets, commentators and on social media.

Some pointed out the irony of one of the film's promotional posters tweeted by Pednekar, where her character was ""surrounded by skin lightening products (and) is actually lightskinned and in brownface.""

Pednekar defended the director's decision to cast her in the movie, according to Indian media reports, saying factors apart from physical appearance play a major role: ""If a filmmaker has taken me, it is because I add some value to the film."" ​

The director, Amar Kaushik, told the Press Trust of India he ""thought about casting a dark-skinned actor,"" but ""felt Bhumi was superb for this character.""

CNN reached out to Pednekar via her agent and Kaushik for comment, but both ​declined to comment.

The popularity of films that use brownface, such as box office hits ""Super 30"" and ""Gully Boy,"" also released in 2019, suggest that Bollywood ​is yet to come under significant public pressure for a practice that many people consider racist and offensive.

'Glamour behind the mask'

India's attitude towards fairness is an ancient concept.

""It predates colonialism and is certainly linked to caste,"" said sociologist Sanjay Srivastava, who works at the Institute of Economic Growth in Delhi.

""Hindu religious texts are full of what we would now recognize as racial stereotypes: lower caste figures as dark and ugly... To be dark is to be a manual laborer, working in the sun. Fair skin is also a mark of class.""

The arrival of pale-skinned British colonial leaders in the 18th century also had a role to play, deepening the prejudice, he said.

""During the colonial era, race and racism functioned in the context of the so-called mixed-race populations, the Anglo-Indians. The 'closer' you were to a white progenitor, the higher up in the hierarchy of race."" British rule is also blamed for further polarizing the castes.

Fairness, on the other hand, is revered and considered a sign of beauty and status. ""Bollywood, and Indian cinema generally, had two remarkable antecedents: religious iconography and Parsi theater,"" said Vijay Mishra, a Professor of English Literature at Australia's Murdoch University and the author of ""Bollywood cinema: Temples of desire.""

""For both, 'whiteness' was essential,"" Mishra said.

Hindu gods and goddesses are ""remarkably white,"" except for dark-skinned Shiva, Rama and Krishna, he said. In Parsi theater, ""Parsis, through their Iranian ethnicity, are extremely fair.""

India's independence in 1947 paved the way for a new constitution that outlawed caste-based discrimination, but it is still prevalent in parts of India. In its 2019 World Report , Human Rights Watch noted that Dalits, formerly referred to as ""untouchables,"" ""continued to be discriminated against in education and in jobs.""

And colorism, discrimination based on the color of someone's skin, is prevalent in Bollywood, Srivastava argued. ​

""Colorism is not problematized at all, since a vast number of Bollywood cinema relies upon prejudice as a vehicle for entertainment.

""It would be considered perfectly natural that they would don brownface to portray a dark character... (because audiences) also like to be assured that the glamour is still there, behind the mask.""

CNN reached out to Yash Raj Films that handles ""Gully Boy"" actor Ranveer Singh's publicity for comment, but they declined.

""Super 30"" actor Hrithik Roshan's representatives did not respond to CNN's request for comment.

The decision to choose a fair-skinned, famous actor over a dark-skinned performer is based on the desire to make a big budget movie ""financially viable,"" said film director ​Neeraj Ghaywan, who has worked on Bollywood and independent films. ""That is how people think in Bollywood.""

As a member of the Scheduled (or Dalit) Caste, the lowest rung on India's societal ladder, Ghaywan is a rare exception in an industry dominated by higher castes.

He tweeted a callout last year for assistant writers and directors from lower castes to contact him for work.

Ghaywan believes Bollywood's lack of diversity may be partly why caste is misrepresented.

People from the Scheduled Caste make up 16.6% of the Indian population, according to 2011 census figures. But in 2014, analysis by The Hindu newspaper found that only two Bollywood movies made that year had featured a lower caste character in a leading role.

However, Ghaywan argued that the root of the problem is that caste discrimination is deeply entrenched in India and that Bollywood is merely reflecting society's ideals.

""They have been so internalized through our cinema itself,"" he said, referring to an early example of the 1957 Indian epic ""Mother India,"" where actor Sunil Dutt's skin was darkened to play the role of a farmer.

""We internalize it so much that it is part of a muscle memory, and we don't even think about it.""

Bollywood's endorsement of fairness products

But ​like discrimination on the basis of caste, discrimination on the basis of skin color is not confined to the big, Bollywood screen.

Seema Hari was born and raised in Mumbai. She said she was bullied at school for being dark-skinned and even taunted on the street by passersby who would tell her that she was bringing bad luck by showing her face in public.

""I did not know a reality where I was not depressed or suicidal in my childhood,"" said Hari who is now a Snapchat software engineer and model based in Los Angeles.

She also campaigns against colorism, which she said is evident not only in Bollywood but on the shelves of Indian pharmacies and supermarkets that stock skin-lightening products.

Advocates say some of the best-known Bollywood stars are perpetuating the preference for lighter skin by lending their names and faces to the industry's advertising campaigns promoting ""fairness"" creams.

""Some of the ads... were so blatantly racist... If you put a Bollywood star in it, it becomes normal; it becomes what people accept,"" said Hari.

Society's preference for lighter skin has led to a booming global business in skin lightening products. The international market for skin whitening cosmetics is predicted to reach more than $6.5 billion by 2025, according to a report by Global Industry Analysts.

While a handful of Indian celebrities have refused to be associated with skin lightening products, some big names have allowed their faces to be used to promote them in India. ​

Often dubbed the ""King of Bollywood,"" actor Shah Rukh Khan ​endorsed ""Fair and Handsome,"" a fairness cream for men, ​for years.

In 2013, a petition calling for an end to the product's discriminatory advertising garnered more than 27,000 signatories. In 2016, Khan reportedly told The Guardian that he would never use the product himself, although it is unclear whether his sponsorship remains active. His agent did not respond to CNN's request for comment.

Khan isn't the only celebrity who has modeled ​for skin lightening products. For example, actor John Abraham currently endorses the Garnier Men PowerLight fairness moisturizer. ""John endorses (the) entire Garnier men's skin care and hair range and the communication is skin and hair care,"" his manager, Minnakshi Das ​said.

In 2014, the Advertising Standard Council of India (ASCI) issued guidelines on the promotion of fairness products, stating that they cannot show dark-skinned people as depressed or disadvantaged.

While the independent body said they saw a ""substantial shift"" in discriminatory advertising, Bollywood stars continued to appear in promotions.

In February, the Indian ministry of health and family welfare proposed a draft bill that would ban advert​isements that promote fairness creams, among other items. Law breakers could face a five-year jail term or ​a Rs 50 lakh fine (about $70,000).

""Celebrity endorsements are a huge part of the advertising industry,"" said Shweta Purandare, secretary general of the ASCI.

""It commands about 24% of India's total advertising expenditure... With new regulations... we expect to see celebrities being more cautious."" However, it is not clear from the bill whether celebrities themselves would be punished.

'They just want to be white'

But skin lightening is not limited to over-the-counter creams.

""We have a few patients who aspire to be in Bollywood (and) who are too much into skin lightening treatments,"" said dermatologist Dr. Sujata Chandrappa, who runs a beauty clinic in the southern city of Bangalore.

Clients ask her how certain dark-skinned stars became so fair-skinned. ""This is deep rooted in the Indian psyche, that fairness is the prerequisite factor to enter into the Bollywood industry.""

She told CNN that she tries to talk some people out of the treatments, only offering the skin lightening procedure if a client has skin issues such as melasma, hyperpigmentation, sun damage or age spots. If a client insists on help to make themselves fairer in the absence of any other skin problems, she refuses to carry out the treatment.

""I get this feeling that I'm encouraging racism, which is not acceptable. But they just want to be white."" ​

However, conversations on colorism are starting to change.

Ten years ago, Indian NGO ""Women of Worth"" founded the ""Dark is Beautiful"" campaign that runs workshops in schools, colleges, workplaces and communities across the country to dismantle prejudiced attitudes towards dark skin.

They also initiated the petition against Shah Rukh Khan's endorsement of the ""Fair and Handsome"" cream.

Nandita Das, actress and spokeswoman of the ""Dark is Beautiful"" movement, said the campaign has encouraged victims of colorism to share their stories, exposing the extent of India's obsession with fairness.

""Suddenly, it was out in the open, something that had been there for so long in our matrimonial ads, cosmetics and products that we see all around,"" Das told CNN. ""We wonder why we haven't talked about it much earlier.""

Das, who also screen-writes and directs, believes ""we have a long way to go"" before this billion-dollar industry casts a dark-skinned performer in a leading role.

She said her skin tone would make her ""perfect"" for a lower caste or class role. But when she plays ""an educated or upper middle-class character, often the director, cinematographer, or makeup person tell you: 'don't worry, we'll lighten your skin.'""

Das believes Bollywood directors have the freedom to cast whom they please, but she advises thinking ""deeper into that prejudice.""

Some experts argue that Bollywood's influence on society is bigger than ever, partly because of social media.

On-screen stars ""used to be legends whom nobody saw"" in real life, said film critic Subhash Jha. ""(But) they've started to become very close to their fans, so the impact is larger."" The biggest Bollywood stars have tens of millions of followers on Instagram and TikTok, the video-sharing social networking service.

Hari believes that Bollywood celebrities could be doing much more to change attitudes across the country to dark skin. Imagine ""Shah Rukh Khan walking away from a (fairness product) advertisement,"" she said. ""That itself will change so many minds.""

But does the industry's persistent perpetuation of colorism suggest that it is racist?

""Deeply, fundamentally, irrevocably,"" said Srivastava. ""There are no standards of beauty linked to dark skin... There is no vocabulary within Bollywood to discuss race at all because in broader society, no such vocabulary or context has been allowed to develop.""

When it comes to using brownface in movies, ""they don't even think there's a problem,"" said film director Ghaywan. ""That's the biggest problem.""

Marianna Cerini,From rainbow to gray: The evolution of hair dye,"Written by Marianna Cerini, CNN

CNN Style has launched a dedicated Beauty section. Read more Beauty stories here

For centuries, hair dye has been pivotal in helping people portray a certain image -- to either fit in with the beauty standards of the day or to dramatically subvert them.

Women in particular have long tried to conform with the notion that female beauty comes with a glossy mane -- from blonde to black to dusted with gold or flour, depending on the time and place.

""Throughout history, the status of our hair has served as an instant visual cue for value judgment,"" said Caterina Gentili, PhD candidate at the Centre for Appearance Research in England, in a phone interview. ""One of the many ways for society to objectify female bodies, and deem them worthy, or not, of attention.""

In recent decades, Gentili said ""hair color products have become a key tool for women to stay visible, and shield them from one of the biggest stigmas placed on them: aging.""

By 2025, the global hair color market is expected to be worth around $28 billion , up more than 8% on its estimated value of $17.8 billion in 2019, indicating continuing strong demand for hair-altering products.

However, the figures don't show a small, growing trend among women to embrace their natural locks -- grays included -- as a statement against traditional gender expectations.

Now, dying your hair is not solely about covering up imperfections; it's about upending ideals, making a bold statement and reclaiming your natural hue.

From leeches and sulfuric acid to synthetic dyes

In its early iterations, hair coloring was done by both men and women to enhance their looks or hide white strands, according to Victoria Sherrow's ""Encyclopedia of Hair: A Cultural History.""

Ancient civilizations used rudimentary hair colorants, based on recipes that included cassia bark, leeks, leeches, charred eggs, henna -- still commonly used across the Middle East and India -- and even gold dust.

Ancient Greeks favored gold and red-gold shades, associated with Aphrodite, the goddess of love, health and youthfulness. Likewise, high-class Greek and Roman prostitutes opted for blonde hues to suggest sensuality.

It wasn't until the Middle Ages in Europe that hair dyeing began shifting into a predominantly female habit.

Bleaches, often made with blended flowers, saffron and calf kidneys, were particularly in vogue, although Roman Catholics associated blond hair with lasciviousness.

Red dyes, often a mix of saffron and sulfur powder -- the latter of which could induce nosebleeds and headaches, was popularized during the 16th-century reign of Elizabeth I of England.

The hue was a favorite in Italian courts as well, thanks to Renaissance artist Titian, who painted female beauties with red-gold locks. In the 18th century, European elites favored perfumed white and pastel powders made from wheat flour dusted lightly onto natural hair and wigs.

While most hair dyes were composed of plants and animal products, the evolution of the practice also saw the use of dangerous, even lethal methods to change hair color: lead combs to darken it, or sulfuric acid to lighten it.

It wasn't until the early 20th century that hair dye as we know it -- chemical, in a rainbow of colors, shop-bought or salon-applied -- came to be.

In 1907, a young French chemist named Eugene Schueller used para-phenylenediamine (PPD), a chemical discovered in the previous century, for the world's first synthetic dye, which he called ""Oréal.""

Two years later, Schueller founded his business, the French Harmless Hair Dye Company -- a name meant to alleviate people's fears of using manufactured hair color. In 1909, he decided to change it to something a little snappier: L'Oréal.

The aging card

For the first decades of the 20th century, women were fearful of commercial dye formulants. Chemical hair color was considered unsafe, and the practice itself had an image problem: as in the modest Victorian era, it was seen as something vain women, not respectable housewives, would do.

In the 1940s, even as the beauty trend became more popular, salons offered back entrances for clients who didn't want to make their dye habits known.

To expand their market, some beauty companies decided to tap into the anxiety around aging and sell color as a way to cover up gray hair. A black-and-white French L'Oréal ad from the 1920s depicted a sad-looking woman next to a smiling version of herself in a black bob; the English translation reads: ""Not one more white hair; forever 30 years old.""

A Clairol print campaign from 1943, ""Gray Hair -- The Heartless Dictator,"" declared: ""Without justice or kindness, gray hair can rule your life... It can dictate many things you say or do. No wonder other women refuse to tolerate this tyrant.""

Pressuring women to maintain their hair color as they aged ""was the marketing ploy that made hair dye as ubiquitous as using soap,"" said Claire Robinson, author of the essay ""Grey is a Feminist Issue.

""While the ideal had been perpetuated for generations, the modern beauty industry pushed it in a more aggressive way, playing on insecurities (and) self-doubt.""

Advertising companies also worked on normalizing dyes by selling them on their subtlety, such as the iconic 1956 Clairol ad ""Does she...or doesn't she?,"" which was so popular that copywriter Shirley Polykoff's slogan became a catchphrase in the States. Around that time, the debut of home-color kits also ensured privacy, paving the way for the widespread use of hair dye.

While in the 1950s only 4-7% of American women dyed their hair, by the 1970s, the figure had risen to some 40%. By 2015, an estimated 70% of American women were using it. A 2019 OnePoll survey for haircare brand Living Proof showed similarly high figures in the UK.

In South and East Asia, the picture is similar. In India, where the hair care industry is a $3.3 billion business, colorants account for 18% of the overall hair category and have been growing 15% a year, according to a report by Nielsen . Indian women are particularly fond of Garnier Black Naturals , owned by L'Oréal, currently its highest selling hair dye brand globally.

Sales of hair colorants in the Middle East and Africa registered at $201.88 million in 2017, an increase of almost 10% over 2016, with bleachers as the market's fastest growing segment.

China and South Korea have all seen a huge increase in demand for hair color products, mostly darker dyes, both for men and women. In Japan, the beauty ideal attached to black hair is so strong that some schools force students to dye their hair black, though in recent years the rule has provoked backlash.

But dyeing is no longer just about natural looks. Dip dyes and rainbow hues spanning pink, turquoise and violet have become fashionable for young women across the world and, to an extent, men (such as celebrities Jared Leto and Zayn Malik). Bright shades also began appearing on armpit hair, notably by Miley Cyrus.

Roxie Jane Hunt, a Seattle-based hair stylist who specializes in rainbow dyes, sees this new approach as a way ""to demonstrate personal choice and play around with identity,"" she said over the phone. ""A lot of women feel like they want to stand out, not blend in.""

In Asia, South Koreans especially embraced rainbow dyes, from coral to ash to cherry pink. Chameleon-like hair changes even became a signature look for a number of K-pop stars -- so much so that a new hair color is often seen as signifier of a change in those artists' careers, be it a new album, single, or tour.

Over the last couple of years, a growing number of Asian women have also been going blond or full platinum -- a way for some to feel like a stronger version of themselves

Gray is the new blond

Gray has also become popular -- entering salons and home kits as a ""hot"" new dye.

Shades of silver, steel or platinum white -- for which social media coined the hashtag #grannyhair -- were touted by celebrities including Kim Kardashian and Ariana Grande.

Suddenly, gray tones were cool -- albeit, one might argue, only on women under 40, and when achieved via costly colorants and treatments.

While gray coloring might trend on Instagram, natural gray hair still has a complicated reputation for women around the world -- and in China, men.

""Gray has been made out to be something to be avoided at all costs in the name of self-respect,"" Robinson noted.

For the handful of famous women who have embraced it -- Judi Dench, Helen Mirren, Jamie Lee Curtis, Theresa May, Christine Lagarde -- there's a much larger segment of the entertainment, cultural and political worlds that have not.

""The lack of white-haired role models or naturally graying young stylish icons isn't at all surprising,"" Gentili said. ""For a long time, and still today, a woman with gray hair would conjure up images of a grandmother: wise and nurturing, but completely desexualized. Salt-and-pepper men on the other hand -- even that expression is so different! -- are seen as distinguished, charismatic, confident, experienced, sexy.""

For a lot of women, the double standard feels ever-so stifling. Since Truslow Smith launched "" Grombre"" -- a play on gray and ombre -- in 2016, the Instagram account has garnered more than 174,000 followers, with dozens of women submitting photos of their gray heads daily. Truslow Smith, who found her first gray hair at 14 and decided to stop dyeing at 24, said it has encouraged positive conversations around the topic, but also served as a form of validation.

""Embracing natural gray hair truly is a lifestyle shift, not just a trend,"" she said. Most people who do it don't usually return to dyeing. It's a liberating decision.""

She notices how young some of the posters are, and hopes the term ""premature graying,"" which describes people in their 20s and 30s, can be re-evaluated.

""Is it truly 'premature graying,' or has hair dye been established as such a standard that we don't know what natural looks like at certain ages?""

Be it gray or lime green, embracing a color change outside of the established canon is, for many, a leap of faith.

""It's a form of self-expression,"" Hunt said.

All the more if you're asserting yourself as a woman who is not afraid of aging.

""It takes courage,"" Gentili said. ""It's a choice far more rebellious than any pink dye will ever be.""

Joshua Berlinger,How did Kim Jong Un get his Mercedes-Benzes? New report traces origin of North Korea's luxury rides,"Joshua Berlinger , CNN Written by

On June 14, 2018, two armored Mercedes-Maybach S600 Guard vehicles were shipped from the Dutch Port of Rotterdam, heading out on a journey that would take months and see the cars transported thousands of miles through six countries, according to a new report from the Washington-based Center for Advanced Defense Studies (C4ADS).

After stops in China, Japan, South Korea and Russia, the two cars -- each worth about $500,000 -- are believed to have been flown to their final destination, Pyongyang. And in the North Korean capital, there's only one customer who likely requires this type of ride.

The origin and journey of the two Mercedes luxury vehicles were exposed in the C4ADS report. CNN has not independently verified C4ADS' reporting.

Sanctions passed by the United Nations as punishment for Pyongyang's nuclear weapons development are supposed to bar companies and individuals from selling luxury goods to North Korea.

C4ADS found that North Korea imported at least $191 million worth of luxury goods from 2015 to 2017, sourced from ""as many as 90 countries"" in violation of United Nations sanctions. Definitive figures are difficult to determine because there isn't a shared definition of what constitutes a ""luxury item"" and due to the surreptitious way North Korea imports such items.

The Mercedes-Maybach S600, however, is undoubtedly luxurious. It's equipped with leather massaging seats and armor to protect occupants from steel-core ammo fired from assault rifles and from explosive devices, according to Car and Driver.

Kim is usually seen being chauffeured in what's believed to be a Mercedes-Maybach Pullman Guard armored limousine, which carries a price tag upwards of $1 million. It's believed that was the vehicle his security escort ran alongside of during his first summit with South Korean President Moon Jae-in last year.

Kim was also spotted with a Rolls-Royce last year

Daimler, the company that owns Mercedes, told CNN it ""has no indication on how the mentioned vehicles were delivered and where they come from.""

""Our company has had no business connections with North Korea for far more than 15 years now and strictly complies with EU and US embargoes. To prevent deliveries to North Korea and to any of its embassies worldwide, Daimler has implemented a comprehensive export control process, which we consider appropriate and effective and which meets all requirements of the export control authorities,"" the company said in a statement to CNN.

""Sales of vehicles by third parties, especially of used vehicles, are beyond our control and responsibility. We always investigate the vehicles displayed on the photos in the media thoroughly. However, without the vehicle identification numbers it is impossible to find a concrete trace.""

C4ADS concluded that North Korea maintains a complex, constantly evolving series of schemes in order to obtain luxury goods, like Kim's cars, to get around global export controls. The report concluded Pyongyang has imported 803 luxury vehicles from 2015 to 2017, with the majority originating from Russian companies.

""Not only are they continuing to use techniques that have been successful in disrupting traditional enforcement, but they're also sort of watching how we're tracking them and developing much more sophisticated techniques to continue to evade sanctions,"" said Jason Arterburn, a co-author of the C4ADS paper.

Lucas Kuo, another one of the report's co-authors, told CNN C4ADS' investigation aimed to ""evaluate what were the deficiencies within the international system that allowed this activity to continue?""

Eight months of investigating

Kuo said it took himself and the report's co-authors eight months of investigating how Kim was able allegedly to obtain the Benzes. They scoured customs records, shipping data, bills of lading and other open-source documents to trace how the vehicles made their way from Rotterdam to Pyongyang.

""We think we built a pretty compelling case to say that these Mercedes were likely bound for North Korea,"" he said.

CNN has not independently verified C4ADS' reporting.

Kuo and his co-authors concluded that the two Mercedes left Rotterdam for Dalian, then made their way on to Osaka, Japan, and Busan, South Korea. From South Korea, they were shipped out on a vessel called the DN5505, per the bill of lading.

That's when the journey gets murky. Shortly after the DN5505 left South Korea, it reported via its AIS system -- a way to locate ships at sea -- that its intended destination was the Russian city of Nakhodka, where it was estimated to arrive on October 5, according to C4ADS.

However, the ship's AIS data stopped pinging locations from October 1 to 19, according to the report. Though AIS transponders do not ping when ships are far at sea, they could have been turned off -- a common tactic used by ships breaking sanctions law, experts say.

When the DN5505's transponder turned back on, the ship was spotted near where it originally disappeared, according to C4ADS, but this time heading in the opposite direction back to Busan. On November 2, the vessel submitted a bill of lading to South Korean customs authorities that showed the ship was transporting anthracite coal allegedly from Nakhodka. But in Nakhodka, ""no record exists"" of the DN5505's arrival, C4ADS said.

CNN has reached out to the Port of Nakhodka authorities for comment on the report.

Back in Russia, on October 7 -- two days after the estimated arrival time of the DN5505 -- three Ilyushin-76 cargo jets operated by North Korea's state-run airline reportedly traveled from Pyongyang to Vladivostok. Those jets are often used to transport armored vehicles used by North Korea's elites, and are rarely spotted in in Vladivostok, C4ADS said.

""When asked for comment, the North Korean consulate in Vladivostok reportedly did not provide an explanation for the unscheduled flights on October 7,"" C4ADS said in its report.

""We have not uncovered direct evidence that the overlapping visits of the cargo jets and the DN5505 to the Russian Far East are related. However, given the heavy lift cargo capacity of the planes and their role in transporting Kim Jong Un's armored limousines, it is possible that the cargo jets could have loaded the Mercedes,"" the C4ADS report said.

Dual use

While cracking down on luxury goods may not hurt North Korea as much as going after its valuable coal exports, identifying those who allegedly helped Kim get his cars could close off some loopholes, said George Lopez, a former member of the UN Panel of Experts on North Korea, which is charged with monitoring sanctions enforcement and efficacy.

C4ADS also claims that understanding how North Korea smuggles luxury goods could provide useful information to law enforcement attempting to stop Pyongyang's from obtaining more dangerous items with military or nuclear applications.

""North Korea acquires high-end luxury goods through the same overseas smuggling networks as other contraband. As a result, their detection and seizure could be a means to drive action against the Kim regime's core procurement operations,"" the report found.

""High-end luxury goods share key features with dual-use goods for North Korea's weapons program: they are scarce, specialized products with high monetary value and great symbolic importance for the Kim regime.""

Jacopo Prisco,Ryugyong Hotel: The story of North Korea's 'Hotel of Doom',"Jacopo Prisco , CNN Written by

In 1987, ground was broken on a grand new hotel in North Korea's capital, Pyongyang. The pyramid-shaped, supertall skyscraper was to exceed 1,000 feet in height, and was designed to house at least 3,000 rooms, as well as five revolving restaurants with panoramic views.

The Ryugyong Hotel -- named after a historical moniker for Pyongyang meaning ""capital of willows"" -- was supposed to open just two years later. But it never did.

While the structure reached its planned height in 1992, it stood windowless and hollow for another 16 years, its naked concrete exposed, like a menacing monster overlooking the city. During that time the building, which dwarfs everything around it, earned itself the nickname ""Hotel of Doom.""

The hotel has since been clad in metal and glass, and was later fitted with LED lights to turn it into a colorful nighttime spectacle. Construction work has started and stopped many times, fueling constant speculation over whether it will ever open to guests.

Still closed to this day, the Ryugyong Hotel is the world's tallest unoccupied building.

A Cold War pawn

The Ryugyong Hotel was a product of the Cold War rivalry between US-supported South Korea and the Soviet-backed North. The year before construction commenced, a South Korean firm had built what was then the world's tallest hotel, the Westin Stamford in Singapore. The South's capital Seoul was meanwhile getting ready to host the 1988 Summer Olympics, with the country transitioning to a capitalist democracy.

As part of North Korea's political response to the South's achievements, Pyongyang organized the 1989 World Festival of Youth and Students, a sort of socialist version of the Olympics. The country planned to build the massive hotel just in time for the event, stealing the world record away from the South.

But due to engineering problems it wasn't finished in time for the festival. The government had already poured billions into the event, building a new stadium, expanding Pyongyang's airport and paving new roads. That put a strain on the hermit state's frail economy, while the Soviet Union's collapse left it deprived of vital aid and investment.

North Korea was bound for an economic crisis. Although the external structure had been completed, construction was halted in 1992 and a crane was abandoned on top of the building.

A concrete structure

The building consists of three wings, each sloped at a 75-degree angle, converging into a cone encasing the top 15 floors, which are intended for restaurants and observation decks.

The pyramidal shape is about more than aesthetics -- it's because the Ryugyong, unusually for a skyscraper, is made of reinforced concrete rather than steel.

""It was built like this because the upper levels needed to be lighter,"" said Calvin Chua, a Singapore-based architect who has extensively researched Pyongyang's urbanism, in a phone interview. ""They didn't have advanced construction materials, so it was built entirely in concrete. You can't achieve a slender tower that way, you need to have a massive base with a tapered top.

""If you look at the history of construction in North Korea since the end of the Korean War, most of the buildings are made of concrete: That's the material that they are familiar with, and the technology transfer between Soviet or communist states is purely based around concrete.""

According to Chua, who has worked in North Korea with local architects, the Ryugyong may have been designed to look like a mountain, not a pyramid, because mountains play an important role in the country's symbolism. The official biography of Kim Jong Il, the deceased father of current ruler Kim Jong Un, states that he was born in a secret military camp on Mount Paektu, the tallest mountain in the Korean peninsula that is depicted in the national emblem of North Korea. (Many historians believe Kim Jong Il was actually born in Russia.)

""It's a very iconic building, but I think it's important to consider where it sits in relation to the entire city fabric of Pyongyang,"" said Chua. ""It's like a sort of obelisk. If you think of the obelisk in Rome's St. Peter's Square, it provides a [beacon] for the city apart from its symbolism. The Ryugyong is similar, but it's also more symbolically defined.""

A second start

In 2008, after a 16-year pause, construction unexpectedly resumed, as part of a deal with Orascom, an Egyptian conglomerate that was contracted to build North Korea's 3G network.

The rusty old crane that had stood atop the building for two decades was finally removed . Workers aided by Egyptian engineers installed glass and metal panels to the concrete structure at the cost of $180 million, glazing it completely and giving the building a polished, sleek appearance. The project, completed in 2011, fueled speculation about the hotel's opening. In late 2012, German luxury hotel group Kempinski announced that the Ryugyong would partially open under its management in mid-2013, but then pulled out a few months later, stating that entering the market was ""not currently possible.""

Long-standing rumors that the building was structurally unsound due to poor construction techniques and materials gained strength once again. In 2014, a 23-story apartment building collapsed in Pyongyang because construction was ""not done properly,"" according to North Korean state media reports.

""Judging from the exterior, the building looks structurally sound, although the interior may be a different story,"" said Chua. ""I think the real problem might be the ease of fitting it out, because it was built with concrete and it would take a lot of time to rewire the necessary services and ventilation systems that were originally created to 1980s specifications. That would be much easier with a steel structure.""

Photographs of the hotel's interior from 2012 revealed that, inside, very little work had been done. The images were taken by Simon Cockerell, general manager at Koryo Group, a Beijing-based company specializing in North Korea tours, and one of the very few foreigners to have been inside the Ryugyong Hotel.

""It was arranged through a Korean connection as a birthday gift for me,"" he said in a phone interview. ""First of all, we had a presentation from the director of the site, with videos made quite a long time ago. Then they took us into the lobby area, where there was a lot of exposed cement. Then we went (on) the one working elevator to the top, which was the 99th floor, I believe.

""It took a long time to get there, because it was a service elevator, not a modern lift with a string of buttons. There was a lift operator who determined where to stop. At the top we had a look around, took some pictures and went back down to the lobby again.""

Although its external appearance had been transformed, the Ryugyong still wasn't open.

A brighter future?

The Ryugyong came back to life in 2018, when LEDs were installed on its facade, turning the building into Pyonyang's biggest light show -- as well as a propaganda machine. A four-minute program shows North Korea's history and a variety of political slogans, while the cone at the top projects a huge North Korean flag.

""It's really striking the first time you see it, especially after so many years of the building sitting there in darkness,"" said Will Ripley, a CNN correspondent who has taken multiple trips to Pyongyang, in an email. ""I know they turn it on whenever there are major events in the city, but it's not on all the time -- I would assume to save scarce electricity.""

In recent years, extensive work has been carried out on the site surrounding the hotel, which was recently opened up, making it possible for anyone to walk right up to the front entrance (but not get in). In June 2018, a sign was added to the building, reading simply ""The Ryugyong Hotel"" in Korean and English.

The question remains: Will it ever open? ""It's very hard to say, because since the building was clad in glass, you can't see inside,"" said Cockerell. ""No doubt something's going on. It's a very large building. It's not inconceivable that some part of it may open before the whole of it could open. If it was my building, I'd focus on the top and the bottom.""

The Ryugyong Hotel is no longer the tallest building in the Korean peninsula: The Lotte World Tower in Seoul, completed in 2017, surpassed it by nearly 800 feet (240 meters). It is still the tallest in North Korea, although Pyongyang has seen a growth spurt of high-rise residential towers recently, with the tallest being just 197 feet (60 meters) shorter than the Ryugyong.

For years, to avoid embarrassment, the North Korean government has airbrushed the building from official pictures of Pyongyang. But the installation of the LED lighting may signal that there's a plan for its future.

""I think the North Korean government would definitely like to do something with it,"" said Ripley. ""For years, it was an embarrassing eyesore -- especially before the glass exterior was installed. I imagine if they do finish it, and Kim Jong Un makes an inspection and it's all over the state media, it will be more widely acknowledged as a proud centerpiece of the city.

""Personally, I think it would be fascinating to see what they do with the inside and go all the way to the top. I'm sure the views are extraordinary.""",2020-07-12,https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/ryugyong-hotel-architecture-origins/index.html
Oscar Holland,The man on the phone: What's it like making history's highest auction bid?,"Written by Oscar Holland, CNN

In November 2017 at Christie's New York, Alex Rotter uttered a phrase never before heard at an art auction: ""Four hundred million.""

His bid was in dollars, and the lot in question was the last known Leonardo da Vinci painting in private hands. Audible gasps gave way to applause, and, less than a minute later, the gavel fell to make history.

After fees, the ""Salvator Mundi"" sold for $450.3 million , obliterating auction records for a work of art.

But it wasn't Rotter who made the world-famous purchase -- it was the anonymous bidder on the end of his telephone line. In fact, he was just as surprised as anyone.

""I thought when we reached $200 million it would end,"" he recalled to CNN on the phone. ""Then I thought it would end when we reached $300 million... a natural stopping point.""

""It was really unclear how far the client would go. It was just (me saying), 'Do you want to?' I remember making sure that I -- that he -- was very clear about the bidding increments and what the next bid was.

""Normally I'd just say the next bid, but I remember clarifying it at 300 million. I said, 'It's $300 million, do you want to bid $300 million now?'

""At this level you can't mess up -- you can't (get it) wrong,"" he added.

It's a remarkably candid account, given how tight-lipped Christie's has remained about the historic sale. The auction house has consistently refused to discuss the bidder's identity, though it is widely believed to have been Saudi Prince Badr bin Abdullah bin Mohammed bin Farhan Al Saud, acting on behalf of the kingdom's Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, better known as MbS.

The moment Leonardo da Vinci's ""Salvator Mundi"" sold for $450 million.

""I had no recollection of time -- you could have told me it was two minutes,"" Rotter said of the 18-minute bidding war, adding: ""(It) was one of the most exciting moments that I've experienced in my 20 years of auctions.""

Art world matchmaker

Austrian-born Rotter, Christie's chairman of post-war and contemporary art, wouldn't be drawn on further details. But his recollections of other record-breaking sales paint a compelling picture of high drama and pressured decision-making.

His auction day role -- which the 45-year-old admits is ""quite stressful"" -- sees him telling telephone bidders what's happening in the room. This means relaying the auctioneer's words and price increments in real-time, as well as communicating details about potential rivals (revealing the identity of other phone bidders is, however, ""a big no-no,"" Rotter stressed).

Many of Rotter's interlocutors are long-term clients. So he's also on hand to offer advice -- how much similar artworks sold for, or how a bidding war might unfold. And then, by Rotter's own admission, there's an element of gentle encouragement. Auctioneering is a commissions business, after all (and the so-called ""buyer's premium"" at Christie's ranges from about 13% to 30% of the winning bid).

What might surprise those outside the art world, however, is that his wealthy clients don't always have a maximum price in mind -- even when it comes to multimillion-dollar paintings.

""I've heard people on the telephone say, 'Alex, let's just buy it, no matter how far it goes,' and I've heard people (say), 'I have a limit, and don't even ask me if we reach (it) because I don't want to be tempted,'"" revealed Rotter.

""People have different strategies for how to go about it. I do think people get carried away.

""Competition attracts everyone, and on auction night, you're in the bidding process and it's a little bit of a race. People don't like to lose.""

In recent years, Rotter has become a familiar sight in the so-called ""phone bank,"" the line of well-heeled go-betweens covering their mouths as they confer with anonymous buyers. Last November, he made another world record bid -- this time on behalf of an unidentified client pursuing David Hockney's ""Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures)."" At $90.3 million, the sale marked the highest sum ever paid for the work of a living artist.

This record was broken again, just six months later, by Jeff Koons' $91.1-million ""Rabbit"" sculpture. And although Rotter wasn't on the winning client's side this time, he was nonetheless instrumental in bringing the artwork to auction.

Indeed, despite his public-facing role, most of the Austrian's work happens in the weeks and months prior to a sale. As well as conceiving of auction themes and populating them with relevant works, he serves as something of an art-world matchmaker, filling gaps in collectors' portfolios and tracking down the world's most sought-after paintings.

'Dream of big numbers'

Identifying targets means knowing art intimately -- and seeing lots of it too. The journey to bring Koons' ""Rabbit"" to auction began with Rotter's personal encounter with the sculpture at the Newhouse Apartment gallery in New York at the beginning of the last decade: ""I remember saying to my colleagues, 'one day...'"" he recalled.

Even at the highest echelons of the art market, such instincts outweigh number-crunching. Data ""substantiates the intuition and gut feeling experts have,"" Rotter said.

Hailing from a family of Austrian art dealers, these instincts are, undoubtedly, finely tuned. He made his first sale, aged 13, at his mother's booth at a Vienna art and antiques fair, where he sold an early 19th-century porcelain cup and saucer for the equivalent of $1,000, and a watercolor by Austrian painter Rudolf von Alt for 10 times that.

""My mother had to help in the final round of negotiation as I didn't want to give more than a 10% discount and the guy insisted on more,"" he recalled. ""But I remember the feeling of closing a sale and it had me hooked.""

Thirty years on, closing deals is still the endgame. When desired artworks are identified, it's often Rotter's job to convince their owners to part company with them. Such discussions involve not only an item's valuation, but negotiations over fees and the size of the opening bid (""In an ideal world, you start lower than you think it would make, and then have it run"").

For the aforementioned Hockney painting, whose owner Christie's courted for a year and a half, it was a case of making them ""dream of big numbers,"" as Rotter recalled.

""People who own $80 million paintings are (going) to be savvy and smart. They didn't just sign on the dotted line. They made it competitive. So, after us, they also went to the other auction houses and asked them for opinions, values, pitches.

""There was some price resistance,"" he added, ""Hockney's world record (at the time) was $25 million, and here was a painting that was expected to sell for $80 million.""

But while Rotter estimates that bidding usually starts between 30% and 50% of the expected price, the Hockney auction opened low, at just $20 million -- a quarter of Christie's top estimate. The gamble paid off, as bids soared past $90 million.

""At the end of the day, we got our result by starting low and tempting (bidders) ... so it worked out beautifully.""

Market pressures

With collectors increasingly shopping for art on Instagram and looking beyond Western marketplaces for returns, there are plenty of challenges facing European auction houses.

In July, research firm ArtTactic reported that Christie's, Sotheby's and Phillips had posted a collective 20.3% year-on-year drop in sales in the first half of 2019. Indeed, if it weren't for the $450 million auction of the ""Salvator Mundi"" in 2017, and Peggy and David Rockefeller's huge $832 million private art collection in 2018, then both of these years might have been considered disappointing for Christie's, too.

This recent dip may not concern an auction market known for its volatility. For all the ups and downs of the last decade, global auction sales in 2018 were, at $29.1 billion, slightly above 2008 levels, according to Art Basel and UBS' authoritative Global Art Market Report

But sales of art and antiques online -- whether from auction houses' websites or internet retailers -- have exploded, almost doubling between 2013 and 2018. Online transactions may represent a small chunk of the art market, at $6 billion, but growth looks set to continue. Generation Z collectors are more than twice as likely than their millennial or generation X counterparts to prefer buying art on the internet, the same report found.

With their wood-paneled rooms, corded telephones and paper catalogs, the old auction houses of New York and London appear increasingly antiquated. Nonetheless, Christie's is adapting to the digital age -- more than 250 years after its founding. Last year, it hosted 88 web-only auctions, and generated online sales of $250 million (up by more than 16% from 2016, the year Rotter arrived from arch rival Sotheby's).

It's still a brick-and-mortar business. But Rotter is confident that his employer -- now owned by French billionaire François Pinault -- can use heritage to its advantage.

""There is obviously something very traditional, something charming about (auctions) -- that it's still wooden benches (and) telephones,"" he said. ""There's obviously a digital technology revolution going on in the auction business. A lot of the transactions happen online now. (But) the spectacle of the evening sale stays the same.

""People like to dress up; they like to come to the auction or to participate in it somehow,"" he added. ""It's serious art we're selling, but it's still an event.""

Moreover, he depicts big-ticket auctions as being uniquely democratic -- great levelers through which an artwork's market value emerges in real-time. Or as Rotter put it: ""Who bids the most gets the painting. There's no trickery, there's no advantage for someone who comes first or has a bigger name. That's the beauty of it.""

When it comes to the art itself, however, bigger names command bigger prices. So which painting is the holy grail of the market -- the one artwork his clients all want but can't have?

""There are a handful of objects,"" Rotter said. ""I'm not talking about pieces that are hanging in MoMA or the Metropolitan Museum, because they will never be obtainable. But there is (always) one object that still sits in a private collection -- this one Van Gogh, this one Warhol, this one Koons -- that everyone wants.

""Obviously, I have this list in my office. It lives there -- I know it by heart -- with little thumbnail images.

""You always try,"" he concluded, adding: ""Always shoot for the masterpieces.""

Jacopo Prisco,The unsung car designer who created the DeLorean and James Bond's underwater car,"Jacopo Prisco , CNN Written by

Few other designers have been as influential as Giorgetto Giugiaro in shaping modern automobiles. In a career spanning 64 years he has designed some of the most successful and influential cars in history, ranging from one-of-a-kind exotics to mass market utility vehicles.

He's designed over 200 cars for manufacturers around the world which collectively put over 60 million cars on the road and -- at the age of 81 -- is still working today. Having sold his design practice Italdesign in 2015, he continues to design, now with his son Fabrizio, under the roof of a new firm called GFG Style.

































1 / 17 – Alfa Romeo Iguana (1969) Italian designer Giorgetto Giugiaro has created some of the most successful and influential cars in history, in an impressive career that spans over six decades. This is the 1969 Alfa Romeo Iguana concept, one of the cars that Giugiaro used as an inspiration for the design of the DeLorean a decade later, along with his 1970 Porsche Tapiro concept.

Birth of a legend

Born in 1938 in Garessio, about 60 miles South of Turn, Giugiaro came into the world at the prime time and place for a young boy who would eventually become a gifted designer. Fiat, Italy's flagship automaker, was an hour's drive away and the country's post-war economic boom would coincide with Giugiaro's coming of age. In fact, Giugiaro joined FIAT as early as he possibly could -- when he was just 17 -- but not because he was eager to draw cars.

""I got involved with cars not out of passion, but as a part of my creative process,"" he said in a phone interview from his studio in Moncalieri, just outside Turin.

The Giugiaros were a family of artists and Giorgetto was supposed to pursue a similar path. His father, however, noticed that he had a more technical inclination, and so allowed him to go to art school by day and study technical design in the evenings.

Dante Giacosa, FIAT's technical director, saw some of his car sketches and hired him as a junior designer. ""I joined FIAT in 1955 to have an experience outside of the arts world, not really knowing where it would lead to. This experience was more valuable than a school and gave me confidence to experiment with my creativity.""

After four formative years at Fiat, Giugiaro's work was noticed by Nuccio Bertone, who ran one of several influential coachbuilding ateliers that had sprung up around Turin at the time, including Ghia, Pininfarina and Vignale. Bertone's firm made its name by styling beautiful cars for other manufacturers, and put Giugiaro at work on some forward-thinking projects.

""In 1960 I saw my first prototypes come to life at Bertone: The Gordon-Keeble GT, the Alfa Romeo 2600 and the Giulia GT, which I finished as I was drafted for the then obligatory military service. I was 22.""

After creating cars at Bertone under badges such as BMW, Mazda and Ferrari, Giugiaro switched jobs again in 1965, joining Bertone's competitor Ghia. There, he designed two of his most beautiful cars, the Maserati Ghibli and the De Tomaso Mangusta.

The Mangusta went on to become a minor icon among sports car enthusiasts, although only around 400 were produced. Its passenger doors open normally, the design features gullwing doors for the engine and luggage compartment, a truly unique styling quirk. It's Bill's car in ""Kill Bill: Volume 2,"" it features in the film ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" and in Kylie Minogue's ""Can't Get You Out of My Head"" music video.

The Italdesign era

In 1967 , aged 29 but with 12 years of work experience, Giugiaro started his own design firm, Italdesign, and moved heavily into mass produced cars, shaping some of the world's most successful people movers. As a designer, this is the type of work he preferred. ""The mass-produced car, as a project, has many variables, including timing, costs, feasibility, directors, marketing -- the creative aspect isn't hard, but the mediation between all these variables is. That makes it more gratifying,"" he said.

""The hedonistic car, the car that everybody wants but nearly nobody can have, is a lot easier do to, because it's created for publicity, it doesn't have to rely on a complex structure.""

In 1974 he was asked to design the successor of the Beetle for Volkswagen. The resulting first generation Golf -- known as the Rabbit in the US -- debuted Giugiaro's ""origami period,"" a new styling sensibility dominated by sharp, angular lines. It would influence car design for generations, and create one of the most resounding success stories in the automotive world: The Golf, currently in its seventh generation, is still the undisputed leader in its sector, with sales to date in excess of 30 million units.

Despite his growing fame, Giugiaro kept a low profile. ""When Volkswagen asked me if I wanted to have a badge on every Golf they built that read 'design by Giugiaro,' I said 'No, thanks.' It would have cost me more to send them thousands of badges every day than the money I got from the entire project! When people buy a car, they don't generally care about who designed it. Cars are not artworks. Art is prestigious, but cars are not.""

Movie icons

Giugiaro applied his sharp-edged, origami style to cars that were meant for wildly different purposes and markets.

In 1976 he designed the Esprit for English automaker Lotus, which became James Bond's car in the following year's ""The Spy Who Loved Me,"" famously transforming into a submarine. The very car that was used for the film's underwater scenes was purchased by Elon Musk in 2013 for nearly $1 million.

Shortly after, Giugiaro styled the DeLorean, a 2-door coupe launched in 1981 that was consigned to immortality when Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale picked it as Marty McFly's car for ""Back to the Future"" in 1985. Giugiaro based the DeLorean on the Tapiro, a 1970 concept car he had created for Porsche. It was similarly wedge-shaped and, most importantly, sported a stainless steel body with gullwing doors.

""I didn't expect that it could be picked as a movie car,"" he said. ""Its unpainted look is due to the fact that DeLorean didn't want to spend anything on painting equipment, so he went with stainless steel, but that didn't come without problems. I'm glad when someone remembers that I designed it.""

Around the same time, during a fruitful collaboration with Fiat, he designed the two affordable and compact cars of the 1980s for the Italian automaker: the well-known Uno and the Panda.

With its brutally basic design, Giugiaro's Panda was the opposite of a bedroom poster car in its heyday, but it's now attracting a cult following, the ""4x4"" version especially. In a 1980 interview to Italian newspaper La Stampa, Giugiaro described the Panda as ""a pair of jeans: a simple, practical, no-frills piece of clothing."" He likened the design to that of a military helicopter: ""a light, rational machine designed for a specific purpose.""

More than cars

Giugiaro's designs extend beyond the automotive industry thanks to an industrial design division of Italdesign, launched in 1974. Since then he's designed the Nikon F5 camera trains for the Riyadh metro, a professional coffee machine , a dentist chair, several Beretta guns, sewing machines, watches, tractors, motorbikes and the stadium for Turin's football team Juventus FC, and perhaps the most unexpected -- a pasta shape called Marille.

""These were a great way to fill the dead times between car projects -- but the creative process and technique are exactly the same as a car, there's no difference. It's more liberating, because it lets me escape the normative hell of cars, which are full of rules and regulations,"" said Giugiaro.

Today, Giugiaro is no longer involved with Italdesign, after Volkswagen -- through its subsidiary Audi -- first acquired 90% of its shares in 2010 , then the remaining 10% in 2015 . But he's still designing cars: One of his latest creations, presented at the Geneva Motor Show in 2018 in celebration of his 80th birthday, is an electric concept named Sybilla (after his mother, Maria Sibilla).

Whenever he sees one of his own creations on the road, he has a simple thought: ""I notice what I could have done better. I'm always thinking about the future, about doing what I couldn't have done before. So, in a way, I'm constantly working even when I'm not working.""

There is, however, something he would have liked to design but never got the chance to: ""I love the design of modern fighter jets and even space ships that you see in the movies. I would have enjoyed designing a plane.""

Aileen Kwun,Fashion gaffes are a reflection of the industry's diversity problem,"Written by Aileen Kwun, CNN Contributors Oscar Holland, CNN Stephy Chung, CNN

Last month, fashion house Chanel appointed its first head of diversity and inclusion. Announcing the hire, the French brand said it hoped to provide ""momentum"" for its ""existing diversity and inclusion approach.""

The move marked Chanel's entry into a new race in the world of luxury fashion: the race to hire more diverse talents, and thus lessen the chance of becoming the latest brand to alienate potential customers with racially or culturally insensitive gaffes.

About two weeks later, Gucci then appointed a new global head of diversity, equity and inclusion in order to ""create a more inclusive and equitable workplace and increase workforce diversity."" Prada and Burberry, too, have created a similar position in recent months.

These announcements all appear to be part of the fashion industry's response to accusations that it's out of touch with customers and society at large.

These missteps differ from one another in important ways. Burberry's noose touched on issues of mental health, while the Prada outrage was a matter of race. Gucci's turban, or its balaclava sweater resembling blackface (pictured top), generated backlash in existing markets, while D&G's ads alienated new ones. But what they collectively reveal is that the fashion industry is struggling -- at times -- to keep up with tech-savvy consumers who are ready to call out companies in real-time for insensitive imagery.

Hiring diversity advocates might seem like a sensible way to address fashion's troubling tendency to use stereotypes or cultural appropriation to turn a profit. But the new Chanel appointment has not been without its own controversy: Many on social media expressed their dismay that a white woman, Fiona Pargeter, had been named to the role.

Teen Vogue's fashion and beauty features director Tahirah Hairston took to Twitter to ask , ""why did chanel hire a white woman to be over diversity and inclusion? who is in that room?""

Another user wrote: ""white privilege is hiring a Head of Diversity and Inclusion who isn't a POC @CHANEL.""

In a statement e-mailed to CNN, Chanel said Pargeter's appointment ""is a sign of our commitment to D&I (diversity and inclusion) and its importance to the House.""

The brand declined to comment on questions about its decision to hire Pargeter at a time when fashion industry statistics show that people of color are far less likely to be hired for influential roles than white people. In 2018, The Business of Fashion found diversity to be lacking at the highest levels of leadership after studying 15 of the largest public companies in fashion.

From the outside, it seems obvious that hiring a white woman to lead diversity efforts might elicit a backlash. The blackface and chopstick gaffes seemed even more predictable, playing on racist tropes that have circulated for centuries. So why do they keep happening?

Fashion's new watchdogs

With designers and brands now contending with instant reactions from social media and a 24-hour news cycle, the backlash has become a fierce, tangible force with real consequences for sales.

Fashion's watchdogs -- once a select group of buyers and editors at closed-door runway shows -- are now online influencers and social media accounts, followed by people who might not even buy luxury brands, but are nonetheless vocal critics in cultural debates over ethics and representation.

Take the snarky Diet Prada , an Instagram account (with a cult following of 1.5 million ""Dieters"") that calls out copycat scandals and hypocrisy in the fashion industry. It has been credited with, among other things, fanning the flames of D&G's self-inflicted woes.

Social media has spread fashion -- and its critique -- faster and wider. And the reputational risks of insensitive blunders are real, potentially prompting boycotts that can cost brands millions.

But controversial campaigns and products are nothing new in the industry. Fashion has a long, fraught history of systemic racism, explains Valerie Steele, chief curator and director of the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York.

The industry has been rife with biases and insensitivities toward underrepresented and marginalized groups. Blackface caricatures are images that have persisted since the 19th century, she noted, ""and in the 1920s and '30s, fashion companies would use the n-word, for example, to describe a particular shade of brown"" in marketing materials. ""It was a fairly common practice in the UK, not so much in the US.""

Meanwhile, stereotypical depictions of Asians can be traced back nearly a hundred years with the popularization of conical straw ""coolie"" hats -- a derogatory reference to Southeast Asian laborers that was later appeared to influence Dior's ""New Look"" headgear in the 1940s and again various 1970s Yves Saint Laurent collections inspired by Asia.

Sales of the YSL perfume ""Opium"" appeared to benefit from protests against the scent's name, which many felt trivialized China's painful history of drug abuse and the Opium Wars. The scandal created a notoriety that helped make the scent a bestseller.

""We certainly keep seeing gaffes today, and it leaves one flabbergasted,"" Steele said in a phone interview. ""How do these things even get greenlighted? Who in the world, for example, thought that D&G's ad campaign, insulting and patronizing the Chinese model, would appeal to a Chinese audience? It's absolutely absurd.""

While the D&G ad campaign incensed some viewers, it was Stefano Gabbana's alleged trail of offensive Instagram direct messages that spurred Chinese audiences to boycott the brand, leading a number of online retailers to pull the brand entirely. Gabbana denied sending the derogatory messages, but the damage had been done.

""The reality is, brands have to be more nuanced,"" Steele added. ""Not every form of cultural appropriation is, or needs to be, egregious. But some of them have proven to be deeply offensive, over and over again, and yet we keep seeing them.""

Why brands miss the mark

Whether the result of careless mistakes, willful ignorance or even a cynical ploy for headlines, the recent slew of fashion gaffes may not stem from a single cause. Yet, they share a common characteristic: brands pursuing profit at the expense of cultural sensitivity.

This is particularly the case in China, where European fashion houses are competing to court a new generation of wealthy shoppers.

Here, D&G is not alone in having upset potential customers. Earlier this year, Burberry faced criticism after it marked Chinese New Year with a series of family-portrait-style photos that were ridiculed as ""creepy"" by social media users.

Fashion is full of elaborate cultural code switch, reference and pastiche. In the race to corner new markets, brands have a history of charging in with limited knowledge of the local audiences they seek to entice.

This raises questions about the process that goes into formulating a campaign, and the resources allocated to researching the market.

Former Elle China editor, Ye Zi, also known as Leaf Greener , said the cultural divide between Western and Asian audiences must be bridged in order to move forward. The Beijing native now works as a creative consultant for brands like Chloé, helping to facilitate conversations between staff in Western headquarters and their colleagues in China, while offering insight into Chinese consumers.

She believes that fashion houses must look to hire people who live in, or have previously lived in, the countries and markets being targeted.

""These people should have knowledge of their own country, but also understand what's going on globally.

""With China and Western countries, there's a big gap,"" she said, noting that cultural misunderstandings can go both ways. ""Even (Beijing and Shanghai) can feel like two different cultures or countries. That's something most people outside of China wouldn't understand -- not to mention basic things like the number of dialects used here.""

Tapping the Chinese market is about more than its buying power, she added, suggesting that brands would benefit from showing more respect to their target audiences' cultures. She cited the Hermès-backed Chinese lifestyle brand, Shang Xia, founded by Shanghai-born Jiang Qiong Er, as an example of a smart business move -- one that allowed the French fashion giant to show respect for Chinese consumers, and a vested interest, both financial and cultural, in the country's traditional craftsmanship.

More than money

There is clearly no shortage of money at Europe's biggest fashion houses, and China's rise as the world's fastest-growing consumer market makes it the target of many new products and campaigns. Chinese consumers account for nearly a third of spending on luxury goods worldwide, according to a recent report by consultancy firm Bain & Company.

The D&G incident last November serves as a cautionary tale. It is difficult to calculate the amount of money a brand loses in the fallout of a scandal like this, but they can stand to lose millions if campaigns backfire and customers boycott. Within days of the private messages becoming public, one Chinese e-commerce site said it had removed nearly 60,000 D&G products. But understanding a foreign audience's culture isn't a matter of money, according to Steele.

Dolce & Gabbana forced to cancel show in China

If more Chinese people were involved in planning the D&G campaign, she said, there may not have been as many errors. ""Giving diverse voices a seat at the table isn't enough,"" she argued, saying that those employees also need to be valued and ""in a position that isn't threatened or penalized for speaking up.""

""You can't just have change in terms of representation, like a rainbow coalition on the runway,"" she said. ""You really have to have diversity in terms of who's in power: Who owns the company, who designs for the company, who does the advertising? You need diversity all the way through the entire power structure, not just the face of the brand.""

Steele and Greener both allude to a broader theory that links overseas missteps with offense caused by the people in headquarters in the West: that these gaffes all directly reflect homogeneity in fashion's upper echelons. Just as involving Chinese people may help heighten brands' sensitivity towards China, hiring more black people or Sikhs -- in London, Milan or New York -- might have stopped garments offending those communities from making it past the drawing board.

And the industry's problematic lack of diversity isn't just racial -- it may also reflect socioeconomic inequalities.

""Increasingly, you have to be rich to break into (fashion), because you're getting paid so little at the start, and are less likely to be able to afford unpaid internships,"" said Steele.

""On top of everything else, you have a climate which many people say is one of bullying and conformism, (and) which is hostile to anybody who does not fall within the parameters of whatever clique has the power to make decisions.""

This pervasive culture makes it easier for prejudices to go unchallenged, according to New York-based stylist Ashley Owens, who founded the independent art and fashion magazine Suited in 2015.

""Racism, sexism and homophobia are so ingrained that you actually have to be mentally fighting those biases within yourself constantly,"" she said in a phone interview. ""In order to really change that system, it takes individual, incremental change in the day to day.""

Steps toward accountability

Brands are slowly starting to recognize that they must embrace inclusion within their own ranks if they are to achieve global appeal.

In January, the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) and PVH, the parent company of brands like Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, published a briefing on inclusivity and diversity, making an ethical and creative case for embracing both.

""The (American) fashion industry ... has so far struggled to reflect the country's diversity in its workforce across all levels,"" the briefing stated. ""It's crucial for our industry to understand that diversity and inclusion are not a trend, but the way every company should operate.""

As the report articulated, diversity is ""simply a measure of difference"" within a company -- be it race, age, gender, ability or sexual orientation -- while inclusion goes further, creating ""a climate in which diverse individuals come together to form a collective whole."" Only then, perhaps, will fashion house employees feel empowered to speak out against campaigns or products that are so obviously going to cause offense.

The current disconnect between diversity and inclusion in fashion's ivory tower is clear. The major players are, still, overwhelmingly white. Fewer than 4% of the Council of Fashion Designers of America's (CFDA) members listed on its website are black, and until the September 2018 issue, the cover of US Vogue had never been shot by an African-American photographer.

The industry is also overwhelmingly male. In the US, women may spend three times more on clothing than men, but only 14% of major brands are led by a female executive, according to a 2015 Business of Fashion survey of 50 global brands.

Remedies will take time, and the CFDA's report outlines a number of long-term goals. Attitudes within fashion may be no more offensive than in other homogenous industries, but its public-facing role exposes it to far greater scrutiny. For now, the threat of coordinated action spreading online may be the most powerful force keeping brands in check.

While no fashion house has explicitly blamed their transgressions on insufficient in-house diversity, their responses to controversy offer a tacit acceptance of its role. Shortly after Prada's blackface accessories were withdrawn, the brand announced that two influential African-American cultural figures, artist Theaster Gates and director Ava DuVernay, would lead a new advisory council that will ""elevate voices of color.""

And when Gucci withdrew the aforementioned balaclava sweater from sale, it published an apology alongside what it called a commitment to increase diversity throughout the organization. (It later launched the Gucci Changemakers program, with a particular focus on targeting African-American communities and youth, and announced a $5 million fund ""to support social change by investing in community-based programs.)

Burberry soon followed suit, announcing plans to establish employee councils focused on diversity and inclusion, and telling CNN by email that it is rolling out inclusive leadership workshops and mandatory unconscious bias training. Whether such initiatives bring about meaningful change remains to be seen.

But they are, at least, an attempt to right some of the industry's wrongs, rather than simply apologizing and pulling offensive items from the shelves.

Hannah Ritchie,Meet North Korea's art dealer to the West,"Written by Hannah Ritchie, CNN Pontassieve, Italy Contributors Muhammad Darwish

In a sleepy town in Tuscany, over 8,000 kilometers from Pyongyang, you can find one of the West's largest collections of North Korean art. The man behind the operation, Pier Luigi Cecioni, has been bringing North Korean artworks to Pontassieve -- a small commune just a stone's throw from Florence -- for over 10 years.

The pieces in his collection all come from the same Pyongyang art studio, Mansudae. With an estimated 4,000 employees, it is the largest state-run art house in North Korea -- and one of the largest art production centers in the world.

Cecioni formed his working relationship with Mansudae back in 2005, when, during an official tour of the country with an Italian orchestra, he asked to look at some North Korean art.

Mansudae produces an array of artworks, including woodcuts, oil paintings, charcoal drawings, embroideries and even jeweled paintings.

""Once I was there, I said, 'I'm actually very interested in art -- do you have anything to show me?'"" Cecioni said in his studio. ""They brought me to Mansudae's studio. Nobody had ever heard of it (in) the West, so I asked them whether they would they be interested in doing some business in the West, and they said 'sure.'""

With over 1.2 million square feet of studio space, Mansudae produces an array of artworks, including woodcuts, oil paintings, charcoal drawings, embroideries and even jeweled paintings made from semi-precious stones. Cecioni sells them all, with prices ranging from $300 to $7,000, depending on the size and detail of the work.

The best-sellers, he explained, have been hand-painted propaganda posters, which are the most affordable and have proven popular with art collectors.

Cecioni sells works from Mansudae for $300 to $7,000.

Cecioni said that dealing with the state-run art house has proven to be surprisingly easy. ""Doing business with North Korea is, in a way, very old fashioned,"" he said. ""They're very trustworthy. What they say, they do. And what you say, you have to do.""

How Cecioni imports the artworks -- some of which are over two meters wide -- is similarly straightforward: ""There is DHL in Pyongyang. So they are sent through DHL to us, and they arrive in five days,"" he said.

Sanctions taking effect

Beyond the world of art collectors, Mansudae is best known for large bronze statues, which can be found in African countries such as Namibia and Senegal.

The sale of these socialist-style statues has, however, come under scrutiny from the United Nations, which last year blacklisted the studio as part of tightening sanctions against Kim Jong Un's regime. It is believed that the monuments were being paid for in cash or land, helping North Korea evade existing sanctions and take in millions of dollars in income.

Cecioni imports artworks from Pyongyang using DHL.

""This money is highly significant,"" the coordinator of the UN Panel of Experts on North Korea, Hugh Griffiths, told CNN in December 2017. ""We are looking at at least 14 African (UN) member states where Mansudae alone was running quite large construction operations.""

Cecioni only deals in two-dimensional art, claiming that Mansudae's statue business is separate from the studio's main operation -- despite being run under the same name.

""It's like a big art company, there are many branches,"" he said. ""The money they received from us essentially goes back into running the studio. The very large statues -- that's Mansudae, but it's so different from the other things they do. It's definitely a multi-million-dollar enterprise, so I'm sure there is some direction from the (state).""

Cecioni said last year's UN sanctions has affected his business, as he's no longer able to import North Korean art.

Despite Cecioni's convictions that the art he buys plays no significant role in generating income for the regime, his business was still impacted by last year's UN sanctions.

""The sanctions that are on Mansudae specifically -- I think they were not well placed,"" he said. ""I don't think they had the right perception of what Mansudae really is. They aimed at the statues, and they also hit the things we do, which are irrelevant for the economy of the country.""

Cecioni's ability to acquire new works has come to a sudden halt. ""The sanctions on my business have had a tremendous effect, because we cannot import anymore,"" he said.

Best-sellers, according to Cecioni, have been hand-painted propaganda posters.

But while the Italian is not bringing in any new artworks, he still has over 300 pieces in storage. Demand from international customers hasn't slowed, he said.

But instead of selling from his existing stockpile, Cecioni has begun rejecting sales, saying that the art has always been difficult to accurately value, and that he wants to keep the works he has on hand until he can start importing again.

""We are not really trying to sell anymore,"" he said, ""because we cannot replenish our inventory.""",2020-07-12,https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/north-korea-art-dealer-pier-luigi-cecioni/index.html
Nick Glass,David Hockney at 80: An encounter with the world's most popular artist,"David Hockney's home studio is set deep in the Hollywood Hills. We drive there from Sunset Boulevard, past sweeping views of the canyon below, 1920s Art Deco homes and modernist glass boxes perched at intervals on the hillside.

The ""English Angelino,"" as he sometimes refers to himself, lives in a corner house off the main road, just where the hill flattens out. A verdant, anonymous compound behind high gray fences, it's quiet, with no through traffic. With only a four-figure number on the door and a buzzer, there is no hint that this has, since 1979, been home to one of the world's most recognizable and popular artists.

We are buzzed in and directed up a short path to Hockney's studio, a building set aside from his home. From here, it is hard to make out his actual house, which is apparently a series of one- and two-story buildings -- bungalows almost -- enveloped in plants and shrubs. There are steps down, and somewhere tantalizingly out of sight is Hockney's famous swimming pool, a recurring subject in his paintings.

David Hockney at 80: A rare encounter with the artist

The studio -- a long, white, airy space with a staircase leading up to a gallery -- is a converted paddle tennis court. Upon entering, we see half a dozen or so works in progress. Hockney is preparing for a show at Pace Gallery in New York in April.

We hear him before we see him -- his hacking smoker's cough, to be precise. At 80 (and a half), Hockney is sitting in a favorite comfy armchair, reading the Financial Times. He peers up inquisitively through owlish glasses, before struggling up to greet us. He's wearing a blue and green striped cardigan (familiar to me from recent photos) and paint-spattered trousers, his once vibrantly dyed blonde hair now gray and thinning. He clutches a cigarette packet in one hand.

I'm little nervous at the beginning and don't want the interview to start before the cameras are ready to roll. We've arrived with three cameras to capture Hockney's every gesture, every laugh and every cigarette drag (he smokes three or four cigarettes during the interview).

“ I think I've not done so bad in my life for the last 64 years ... Every day I've done what I want to do. ” David Hockney

Making polite conversation, his assistant J.P. asks where I'm staying. I name a new boutique hotel on Sunset that he hasn't heard of. I complain about the lighting design in my room, which was so moodily dim that I couldn't find the bedside light switches. Evidently no one reads in bed these days -- the dominant fixture is a giant TV.

Hockney quickly interjects: ""Yes, they are just big voids,"" he says, referring to the TV screens. ""I don't like voids.""

Painting the pool

Hockney says that his swimming pool was also looking ""a bit like a void,"" so in the summer, the day before his 80th birthday, he had it drained so he could repaint the bottom himself with arcs of blue.

""Once it was painted, it made you see all the plants,"" he says. The job took him two and half hours, ""and that's how long it took me 20 years ago.""

Hockney's ex-lover, Gregory Evans, who lives next door and runs the business side of things for him, apparently questioned whether he was up to the job. ""Of course, I thought I could do it,"" he says a little defiantly.

He admits that he is stubborn, and you can sense a fierce willpower. He is not happy with the shade of blue -- it's ""a bit too pale"" -- and he may do it again. An hour or so later, after the interview is over, I politely ask if we can film his swimming pool. No, says Hockney -- ""Gregory wouldn't like it.""

A bigger retrospective

The pretext for our visit is Hockney's 80th birthday retrospective, which has already drawn well over a million visitors to London's Tate Britain, the Pompidou Centre in Paris, and The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.

""I realize it is the last time (a retrospective) will be done in my lifetime,"" says Hockney. And that's the truth of it.

I ask him how this retrospective compares with the one in 1988 (around the time of his 50th birthday). ""Well,"" comes the blunt reply, ""it's 30 years later, 30 years more painting. A big difference, 30 years.""

We both laugh and I blush a little with embarrassment. It's arguably a stupid question, but there is also a feeling that Hockney wants his later work to receive the same attention that his paintings from the 1960s and 70s did.

Throughout the interview Hockney is his usual chatty, funny, contrary, bee-in-his-bonnet self. Naturally, he mentions smoking more than once -- ""Sixty-five years ago. I began smoking and they were called 'coffin nails' then.""

His father had been ""a big anti-smoker but (he died from) eating chocolate biscuits at 75. I'm five years older than him now,"" he says with a certain relish.

Fish and chips

Having first achieved success in his early 20s, Hockney has long been financially comfortable. But it seems that money never mattered that much to him, providing he has enough to run his studios.

He has always been generous by nature. I mention an early lithograph he gave away in 1954 -- the interior of a Yorkshire fish and chip shop with a 17-year-old art student, elbow on the counter, patiently waiting for his food to arrive.

""Yes I remember it. I remember drawing it on a lithographic stone they had at the art school in Bradford (in West Yorkshire).""

Hockney has astonishing recall. There were only ""about five copies,"" he says. I tell him that the copy that he gave to the shop's owners recently sold at auction for just under £19,000 ($27,000). Hockney shrugs; he's not remotely bothered. He's well aware that his work has risen hugely in value.

One of the first people to acquire Hockney's art was his friend and fellow student at London's Royal College of Art, the late R.B. Kitaj, in the early 1960s. Kitaj paid £5 ($7) for a drawing of a skeleton. ""That was quite a lot of money then,"" Hockney says, recalling being pleased that he was then able to buy cigarettes in packs of 20 rather than 10.

Hockney holds on to much of his own work, and has set up a foundation to look after it. I mention how much I admire his drawings of his mother, who died age 99 in 1999 (he painted her virtually every time he visited her). Hockney hints that he may exhibit them one day.

A gay pioneer

Hockney recalls the royal photographer, Cecil Beaton , purchasing one of his more sexually explicit paintings, ""Adhesiveness,"" for less than $60.

""I remember delivering it to his house,"" he tells me. ""He had it for 40 years."" The money helped pay for Hockney's first visit to New York in 1961.

We sometimes forget that, as a gay man in the public eye, Hockney was a pioneer of sorts -- an artist too honest not to paint his desires. Fresh out of college, he celebrated his sexuality through his work at a time when gay sex was still outlawed in England (it wasn't legalized until 1967). Those early pictures ""look rather good and stand up,"" he says.

'I feel 30 in the studio'

It's difficult to imagine Hockney not working. His work ethic is utterly engrained.

Hockney likes to paint in silence, ""to look, and look again."" Unlike Lucian Freud, for whom Hockney sat for a portrait for a total of 120 hours, he doesn't talk much to his sitters. Freud, he says, was ""amusing, gossipy and bitchy about other artists.""

Hockney laughs but doesn't elaborate. Both artists attended royal lunches as members of the Order of Merit, and he confides that Freud was always better at conversing with the Queen, as they had a common interest in horse racing.

Hanging by the studio staircase is Hockney's design for a six-meter (20 feet) high stained-glass window honoring the Queen, which is set to be unveiled in Westminster Abbey in October (we are quickly told that we can't film it). Suffice to say, it shows nature at her most glorious.

The image was drawn from memory on an iPad and features a favorite subject, hawthorn blossom. Hockney was obviously inspired by his prolonged stay in Yorkshire (2005-2013) where, year after year, he painted the seasons en plein air. A composite photo shows how it will appear once it's installed by the Abbey's transept. It looks splendid, enlivening an august religious space.

Every day, Hockney paints for six or seven hours. ""I'm perfectly happy doing this,"" he says. ""I feel 30 when I'm in the studio, so I come in every day and work, because then I feel 30.""

Hockney never seems to stop thinking about work. He takes iPad images of his current paintings to bed, so he can look at them and know ""what to do straight away"" the next morning. Painting is Hockney's be-all and end-all.

Our interview is regularly punctuated by his smoker's laugh, a guttural infectious chuckle. But he also seems older and more fragile, perhaps a tacit awareness of mortality. More than ever, he is reluctant to leave his studio -- his refuge, his cave.

He doesn't want to walk far or go to restaurants where he can't hear anything (he has got progressively deafer in recent years, and wears hearing aids in both ears). He is less and less keen on flying, disliking both long flights and travelling alone.

""Travelling, I feel 80,"" he says poignantly.

A bigger book

For almost the first time in his life, Hockney has begun looking back at his work in its entirety to reflect on his exhilarating artistic journey. Implicit in our conversation is the sense of an artist reflecting on his place in art history. And his undeniable conclusion is: ""Yes, I've made a few memorable pictures. I know that now.""

A crucial moment in this self-reflection has been the release of ""A Bigger Book,"" a 77-pound ""sumo"" book published in 2016. It is, he acknowledges, his autobiography.

""Well, I realized,"" says Hockney, flipping through the pages, ""that this would last 100 years. Most people will see my work in this book. So why not make it good?""

""A Bigger Splash"" (1967) by David Hockney Credit: Tate

His own copy -- which comes on a bespoke stand designed by Marc Newson -- is within easy reach, a few feet from his armchair. ""I keep looking through it,' he admits.

""I think I've not done so bad in my life for the last 64 years,"" he muses. ""Every day I've done what I want to do.""

""That's a privilege', I say. ""I know I'm privileged,"" comes the reply, ""I've always known that I was privileged.""

Hanging on the wall, just by the studio entrance, is a framed handwritten note. It was pressed into Hockney's hand by a stranger while he was visiting a museum. It reads: ""Thank you for brightening our world.""

""That was OK, wasn't it?"" he asks rather sweetly at the end of the interview. ""Yes,"" I exclaim, ""more than OK. Thank you!"" And it's true. Hockney has been in fine fettle -- funny and characteristically open, two of the many reasons why he has been so admired and loved for so long.

On camera, the years seemed to fall away. He sparkles and looks momentarily boyish. Before we wind our way back down the Hollywood Hills, he signs my Hockney book for me -- ""with love, David and a kiss"" -- and sees us out with a gentle handshake.

Jonathan Chatwin,The Shenzhen effect: Why China's original 'model' city matters more than ever,"Written by Jonathan Chatwin, CNN

Jonathan Chatwin is a writer, journalist and author of books including "" Long Peace Street: A Walk in Modern China .""

By 2035, China's government expects over 70% of the country's population -- around a billion people -- to be living in cities.

Both Shanghai and Beijing have announced population limits and are implementing policies to reduce the number of new arrivals. These restrictions look likely to be replicated in many of China's more populous cities.

But the rate of urbanization shows no sign of slowing. So, while existing smaller cities can absorb some of the millions who relocate, China is, with increasing haste, looking to develop entirely new urban areas in order to provide homes, jobs and infrastructure -- all while driving economic growth.

The most high-profile of these is Xiongan, a new city being built across three counties in Hebei province, 100 kilometers to Beijing's south west. Announced to great fanfare in April 2017, it's expected to house up to 2.5 million people . Large-scale construction began in 2019 and, over the next decade, an ambitious government plan will see many of Beijing's businesses, universities and hospitals relocated to this new city, alleviating pressure on the capital and encouraging hi-tech economic development in a traditionally industrial area.

Across the country, China's government is investing trillions of yuan to establish new areas and development zones, many of which act as satellites to existing cities. To the south of Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province, Tianfu New Area has been developed over the last decade and is soon set to open Unicorn Island , a 166-acre technology hub designed by Zaha Hadid Architects. In Changsha, capital of Hunan province, the vast and similarly ambitious Xiangjiang New Area is intended to attract hi-tech industry and is home to the country's first test zone for autonomous public transport.

These projects all look back to one city for inspiration: the godfather of urban transformation and the country's ""model"" city, Shenzhen. Now home to over 13 million people, the southern metropolis is the Chinese government's proudest symbol of the last 40 years of economic reform.

Building on Shenzhen

On September 4, 1984, the sound of firecrackers echoed through the streets of Shenzhen as the city celebrated the completion of the International Trade Center, its -- and, at the time, China's -- tallest building.

Deng Xiaoping, the country's then paramount leader, had visited the site earlier that year and had given the project his seal of approval. He was particularly impressed by the speed of construction, which -- though it began slowly, partly due to a lack of proper equipment -- eventually reached a rate of one new floor every three days. The pace with which the upper floors of the tower were built became known as ""Shenzhen speed,"" part of the pervasive mythology that clouds the origins of this so-called ""Instant City.""

For visitors to Shenzhen in the 1980s, the 50-story skyscraper dominated the city's skyline. Over time, however, neighboring buildings would reach, and then exceed, the International Trade Center. As Juan Du, an architect and author of new book ""The Shenzhen Experiment"" observed in an email interview: ""This cluster of tall buildings became the image of China's post-reform modernization and urbanization.""

Special Economic Zones

As China began reforming its economic system and opening up to the world, a process initiated by Deng in the late 1970s, Shenzhen was established as one of China's first four ""Special Economic Zones,"" or SEZs. All four were chosen for their favorable geographical position and access to global markets, with Shenzhen located just across the river from the international hub of Hong Kong.

An oft-repeated myth is that Shenzhen grew from a fishing village. But in 1980 it was already a bustling market town. The surrounding areas that would become the SEZ covered almost 330 square kilometers and included a number of other pre-existing villages and towns. The official population of the SEZ at the time was 94,100, according to Du's research.

Although Shenzhen is now considered a success story, its establishment and early development was not without controversy. The city was, as Deng acknowledged, an experiment, and thus diverged from rules that applied to the rest of China. Shenzhen was allowed to try out comparatively radical ideas, like loosening price controls on goods and inviting foreign direct investment.

Shenzhen was such an exception that, for much of its existence, it was physically separated from the rest of the country by a barbed wire fence. This fortified perimeter was interspersed with seven manned checkpoints and was known as the ""Second Line"" (the first being the border with the semi-autonomous Hong Kong to the south).

Until 2006, visitors from other parts of China needed their passports and a special permit to enter the SEZ.

When Deng visited in 1984, he asserted that SEZs were ""windows of technology, management, knowledge and foreign policy,"" designed to showcase China's potential to the rest of the world -- and the rest of the country. The city was intended to become a ""national model for China's modernization and urbanization,"" Du said.

Architecture and design became crucial ways of representing this model vision of modern China. The country's urban spaces have long emphasized the importance of symmetry, with streets traditionally laid out in straight lines running east to west and north to south. Following these principles, Shenzhen initially spread out along its first east-west avenue, whilst the city's main Central Business District was laid out along a prominent north to south axis, flanked by skyscrapers and landmark architectural projects.

Shenzhen was not, however, a blank slate onto which a symmetrically ordered city could be drawn. Existing villages within the boundaries of the Special Economic Zone grew exponentially, as they were often the first destinations for the thousands of newcomers looking for an affordable place to live.

Those who owned village properties would quickly extend their houses upwards and outwards to offer low-rent accommodation for new arrivals. ""Without the villages, the city would never have grown with the famous 'Shenzhen speed,'"" Jonathan Bach wrote in ""Learning from Shenzhen,"" a collection of essays on the city. ""The city could never have sustained the cost of housing and supporting so much labor.""

However, over time, the villages have been surrounded and overshadowed by new, more lucrative developments -- or razed by developers seeking new opportunities for growth.

As Du observed in ""The Shenzhen Experiment,"" many people in China share a stereotyped view of the surviving villages as being ""dirty, disorderly and inferior,"" though they have been integral in driving Shenzhen's success, and their vibrancy and dynamism are a key aspect of the city's culture. There are still hundreds of these ""urban villages,"" and one of the unresolved challenges in Shenzhen's development is how to sensitively manage and integrate them -- and the millions of people who live in them -- into an ever-growing metropolis that leaders like to promote as an orderly, model city.

A new city center

Shenzhen has proven such a success that it's now faced with a problem unimaginable to its original planners: A lack of space.

One source of new land has been found by building onto what was once the sea.

Through extensive land reclamation, the waterfront at the city's southern edge was extended into the bay almost 20 years ago. A new city center business district, dubbed Shenzhen Bay Headquarters City, is now being built on that land.

""We intend to make Shenzhen Bay a complementary city center to the string of existing central business districts of Shenzhen,"" said Claude Godefroy of Henning Larsen Architects, one of three firms to win a competition to design the new district, in an email interview.

With the first phase of building expected to be completed by 2022, the project features a north-south axis and showpiece skyscraper (the project's main tower will reach a height of over 1,640 feet, the architects said, placing it firmly in the world's 20 tallest buildings).

But beyond the superlatives, its design aims to correct the mistakes of the past. Although Shenzhen has been treated as a model city, the power of hindsight has exposed some of the original plan's shortcomings.

In a city where ""oversize impassable highways crisscross the city and isolate neighborhoods from each other,"" as Godefroy put it, Shenzhen Bay will be pedestrian friendly. A waterfront promenade will be lined with bars and restaurants, correcting ""an historic failure in Shenzhen's urban planning: its disconnection with the sea,"" he added. ""Citizens complain that they sometimes forget they are living in a coastal city.""

One of the project's goals is to attract skilled Chinese and international workers to the city. ""All megacities compete to attract the talents of tomorrow,"" Godefroy said, ""and Shenzhen lags behind in livability compared to Hong Kong.""

The idea of Shenzhen competing with neighboring Hong Kong, long a prosperous global trading hub, is hardly new. But a government plan published over the summer of 2019 directly declared its ambition for Shenzhen to itself become ""a capital of innovation, entrepreneurship and creativity with international influence.""

The plan emphasizes making the city more internationally open, developing its reputation as a technology hub -- it is already home to Chinese tech giants Huawei, Tencent and ZTE, among others -- and improving its environmental credentials. It is to become a ""pioneering demonstration zone of socialism with Chinese characteristics"" according to the State Council , China's cabinet.

""The State Council document was not part of the brief for Shenzhen Bay, but every architect involved with Shenzhen knows that is the agenda,"" said Godefroy. Although he doesn't believe Shenzhen can become a true competitor to Hong Kong, as ""their economies have such a different focus,"" he said that the government's ambition for the new development was very clear -- it wants to ""make this district the spearhead of a plan to position Shenzhen a model city for China and the world.""

A model for China

China's politicians have persistently tried to replicate the ""Shenzhen effect"" as they develop other urban areas around the country.

These new areas often feature architectural motifs reminiscent of Shenzhen, sprawling along broad, perpendicular avenues flanked by convention centers, malls and flagship skyscrapers. And, like Shenzhen, they are generally built with economic revitalization in mind, with local governments often offering favorable terms to developers and companies relocating there.

Take Shanghai's Pudong district, across the river from the city's famous Bund, which drew inspiration from Shenzhen. In early 1990, Deng, who often wintered in Shanghai, began to encourage China's next generation of leaders to allow Pudong -- relatively rural in comparison to the city it faced across the water -- to redevelop, saying that he had made a mistake by not including Shanghai in the original group of Special Economic Zones in 1979. According to Ezra Vogel's 2011 biography of Deng, the paramount leader argued the city could, at least, benefit from developing later than Shenzhen by learning the lessons of its predecessor.

Pudong has since become home to a famed skyline punctuated by some of China's tallest buildings, and the center of the country's financial sector. The district's planning and development was certainly more centralized and coordinated than that of Shenzhen, but despite innovative plans proposed by international architecture firms, Pudong ended up re-articulating the same ideas of urban development: build quickly and ambitiously, maximize land value and prioritize the commercial over the human.

Beyond Pudong, China has struggled to successfully export Shenzhen's remarkable example. Even the other three SEZs established at the same time as Shenzhen -- Shantou, Xiamen and Zhuhai -- failed to develop in anything like the same explosive manner. A myriad of different factors has influenced this -- geography, size and scale, specific local policies and the nature of the cities' populations. As Du noted in her book, ""Shenzhen ... is not a singular transferable model but a plurality, informed by local conditions and local communities.""

Xiongan, Xi's model city

Beijing's new satellite city, Xiongan, is China's latest attempt to replicate the success of Shenzhen. President Xi Jinping has appointed Shenzhen's former mayor and party chief, Xu Qin, as governor of Hebei province, where the city is being built. State media has referred to Xiongan as the "" Shenzhen of the North "" while, according to its master plan, the project is intended to become ""a model city in the history of human development.""

There are differences between Xiongan's development and that of Shenzhen, however. Most obviously, whereas all of the original Special Economic Zones were coastal areas designed to attract foreign capital, Xiongan is 150 kilometers from the nearest coastline.

It will mainly serve a center for domestic, rather than international, industries -- in particular, many of the country's massive state-owned enterprises currently based in Beijing.

The government also emphasizes that Xiongan will be a green ""smart city,"" built on a more human scale and with lower population density than China's sprawling megacities. The city will be comparatively low-rise, and free from the ever-taller skyscrapers that define most new urban developments. Early work has focused on improving environmental conditions in what is one of the most polluted areas of China, with the sizeable Baiyangdian Lake -- around which the city will be oriented -- subject to an intensive clean-up operation.

As with Shenzhen, Xiongan must also navigate the complexities of managing the area's existing population. When Xiongan was first announced, a rush of real estate trading led the government to freeze property sales.

The government has subsequently restricted speculation further by announcing that housing in Xiongan will be subject to strict state controls -- a substantial change to the policy of Shenzhen, where property development was a key driver of economic growth.

Many of the existing residents have already been relocated and compensated. But with a population of around 1 million people in the area -- and over 500 villages to be redeveloped -- enabling satisfactory outcomes for low-income and often older rural residents remains problematic.

One key similarity between the two cities, however, is in the way Xiongan will be integrated into a greater conglomeration of urban centers. Just as Shenzhen now blends almost imperceptibly into the Pearl River Delta's other cities, such as Guangzhou and Dongguan, so Xiongan will be connected via high-speed rail with Beijing and Tianjin, to its east, to form a 130-million-person megalopolis nicknamed 'Jing-Jin-Ji' (a portmanteau of the names of Beijing, Tianjin and ""Ji,"" an ancient name for Hebei province).

There is clearly no lack of ambition for Xiongan. It is a project that reflects the ambitions and concerns of China's current leadership, with Xi seemingly hoping to emulate Deng's legacy in Shenzhen by very publicly attaching his name to the project. ""General Secretary Xi Jinping has planned for, made decisions on and promoted (Xiongan) in person, devoting painstaking efforts,"" read a 2018 planning document.

The extent to which Xiongan will copy -- or diverge from -- the template established by the model city of Shenzhen remains to be seen. But what is indisputable is that Shenzhen's example, both positive and negative, remains hugely influential in China's urban planning, even four decades after the city was established.",2020-07-12,https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/shenzhen-effect-china-model-city-intl-hnk/index.html
James Griffiths,Graphic novel on the Tiananmen Massacre shows medium's power to capture history,"James Griffiths , CNN Hong Kong Written by

As a young man in Beijing in the 1980s, Lun Zhang felt like he was taking part in a new Chinese enlightenment.

becoming newly available. The country was undergoing paramount leader Deng Xiaoping's "" Reform and Opening Up ,"" and previously sealed-off areas of knowledge, arts, and culture werebecoming newly available.

People who had only years before been living in the stifling, hyper-Maoist orthodoxy of the Cultural Revolution, in which anything foreign or historical was deemed counter-revolutionary, could now listen to Wham!, hold intellectual salons in which people read Jean-Paul Sartre or Sigmund Freud, or even publish their own works, taking aim at previously sacred political targets.

""In those days, our thirst to read, learn and explore the outside world was insatiable,"" Zhang writes in his new graphic novel, ""Tiananmen 1989: Our Shattered Hopes.""

But with this intellectual awakening came a growing frustration with the pace of reform in China, particularly how economic liberalization was taking precedence over any suggestion that the Communist Party give up its tight control on the country's politics.

An apocryphal quote attributed to Deng captured the mood at this time, that ""to get rich is glorious,"" but for many people, it was increasingly apparent that only a handful were becoming wealthy, while others were suffering due to growing corruption and the destruction of the social safety net.

Small demonstrations against graft and for greater political reform ballooned into what would become the 1989 Tiananmen movement , in which hundreds of thousands of people protested across the country, with the largest demonstration in Beijing led by workers and student groups.

The pro-democracy protesters occupied Tiananmen Square for months, even holding meetings with top officials. At the time, many felt hopeful that these actions would bring about wider societal change in the one-party state.

Crackdown

Zhang was on the square that spring, when the protesters put forward seven demands, including for democratic elections and an end to state censorship. He was there as the crowds paid tribute to the late reformist leader Hu Yaobang, and he was there as the occupiers sang and danced on what had become the people's square.

He was not there when soldiers opened fire on protesters and fought with them in the streets of the Chinese capital. He was not there when the tanks rolled in. Zhang was in the suburbs of the city with another activist, recuperating in preparation for what some thought would be a last push before the government gave into the protesters' demands.

""When we heard the army had entered Beijing, we tried to reach the square, but our efforts were in vain,"" Zhang writes of when they learned of the bloodshed.

Far from reaching the center of the city, Zhang's attention turned to escape: the authorities were rounding up prominent protesters and leaders, and he was worried about arrest. He fled first to rural China, eventually becoming one of dozens of Tiananmen protesters smuggled into Hong Kong by activists in the then British colony.

Graphic novel

Zhang eventually moved to France, where he has lived ever since, and is teaching at the Cergy-Pontoise University near Paris. While he writes about the Chinese economy and geopolitics, he has largely left out his own personal history prior to this month's publication of his graphic novel.

""I worked with (French journalist) Adrien Gombeaud, who wrote the script for the format,"" Zhang told CNN. ""We read some graphic novels about historical events, and together came up with the plan, for example, to imagine a theater scene to link all the parts of the story.""

While the Tiananmen Square Massacre has been widely covered in the media and in documentaries, with many focusing on the iconic image of the Tank Man or utilizing archive footage from the square itself, much of the events leading up to the infamous night have been lost to history, available only through witnesses' accounts. Zhang said that the comics format provided a key means of capturing the emotion of the demonstrations, in a way that does not necessarily come across in text.

""It is difficult to find a satisfactory way in which this kind of big event is reported, in my opinion,"" he said. ""In some reporting on Tiananmen, the authors didn't reflect enough on the will of students to cooperate with the authorities in peacefully reforming China.

""When you take into account the emotion involved, we can understand why the peaceful way of demonstration was chosen, why there was the huge hunger strike.""

After the initial script was written, the authors worked with French artist Ameziane to develop the comic's visuals, by sourcing images of the various characters, and referencing archival photos of era-appropriate objects, such as clothes, cars and teacups from 1980s China. ""We spent a lot of time in discussions on how to arrange the scenes, how to convey the essential message, what limits we might have on a given page. It played to the style and skill of our painter,"" Zhang said.

The shift in artistic style is most notable in the scenes depicting the massacre itself. Prior pages feature white backgrounds and muted colors, but as the crackdown begins, the pages turn to black, with a heavy use of oranges and reds. Ameziane's illustrations become looser and full of movement, emphasizing the chaos and panic experienced by the characters.

The book is structured in several acts, with Zhang as its narrator. He said the play format was an obvious storytelling device, given ""the protest movement itself felt like a drama, with its different phases akin to great acts.""

Comics journalism

Zhang, Gombeaud and Ameziane's book joins what has quietly become a major strand of modern comics: graphic journalism or historical comics dealing with topics that were once considered out of the art form's remit.

American cartoonist Art Spiegelman's ""Maus,"" a Pulitzer Prize-winning account of his parents' experiences as Holocaust survivors -- with the Jews depicted as mice and the Nazis as cats -- has long been considered a masterwork in the graphic novel genre.

While adult themes and history were features in comics long before ""Maus"" debuted in 1980, including in Spiegelman's own work, its use of accessible, black and white art combined with a sweeping historical narrative broke into the mainstream, and set a new standard for ""grown up"" comics with political subject matter and potentially upsetting content.

Works like Maltese-American Joe Sacco's ground-breaking comics journalism in ""Palestine"" or ""Safe Area Gorazde,"" and French-Iranian Marjane Satrapi's ""Persepolis"" have further driven this trend, with the latter turned into an Oscar-nominated movie in 2007.

The popularity of comics and graphic novels has only grown in recent years -- with the help of blockbuster film adaptations. This has happened in conjunction with the rise of comics journalism, in everything from newspapers to dedicated publications such as The Nib , which has long recognized the medium's ability to tackle serious issues, interweaving reporting with satirical cartoons.

Sacco has talked about how the use of comics, the presentation of the artist and writer as a figure in the story, helps remove ""the illusion that a journalist is a fly on the wall, all seeing and all knowing.""

in a ""To me, drawing myself signals to the reader that I'm a filter between the information, the people and them. They know that I'm a presence, and that they're seeing things through my eyes,"" he saidin a recent interview

This is very much apparent in Zhang's book, as he uses his role as narrator to critique both the protest movement and himself.

Asked once about whether drawing helped him deal with being the child of Holocaust survivors, Spiegelman answered : ""I've had therapy, and I've made comics. The comics are cheaper.""

Part of ""Maus"" deals with Spiegelman's guilt over his difficult relationship with his father and in comparing his problems with depression and work to the experiences of his parents. Zhang too writes in ""Tiananmen"" of his own survivor's guilt and of questioning his decisions made as a younger man in the midst of history.

In an interview, Zhang said he did not write about Tiananmen for so long, because his role, his involvement, seemed inconsequential compared to what some went through.

""The way I saw it, there were many people dead or wounded in the aftermath, and many people lost their jobs; their families were never the same after,"" he said. ""The real heroes were the ordinary students and people in (Beijing) and other cities. By comparison, what I did personally didn't seem worth telling. The most important thing I could do was live my life in a way that wouldn't dishonor the dead.""

He was eventually convinced by an editor to write the book last year, around the 30th anniversary of the massacre. ""She convinced me that I had a duty to the memory of that time,"" Zhang said. ""I accepted it. 'No justice, no peace,' but I think also, 'No memory, no justice.'""",2020-07-12,https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/tiananmen-square-massacre-graphic-novel-comics-journalism-intl-hnk/index.html

Read more unknown and curious design origin stories here

Like many of history's greatest ideas, Tetris came about quite unintentionally.

Alexey Pajitnov was a software engineer at the Soviet Academy of Sciences in Moscow, tasked with testing a new type of computer, the Electronika 60. To do so, he wrote a simple game based on a puzzle from his childhood. It would help assess how powerful the computer was -- and provide a bit of fun.

Little did he know that the resulting game would go on to become one of the greatest, most addictive and most successful of all time.

It was June 6, 1984, and Tetris had just started its journey from behind the Iron Curtain.

The original version of Tetris.

Tetris is a puzzle game in which geometric shapes called ""tetrominoes"" fall down onto a playing field, and the player has to arrange them to form gapless lines. Pajitnov took inspiration from pentomino, a classic puzzle game consisting of all the different shapes that can be made by combining five squares -- 12 in total -- with the goal of arranging them in a wooden box like a jigsaw puzzle.

To simplify things, he knocked that down to four squares, thus reducing the number of shapes from 12 to seven. He called the game Tetris, combining the Greek numeral ""tetra"" (meaning four) and tennis, his favorite sport.

Pajitnov himself was immediately hooked. ""I couldn't stop myself from playing this prototype version, because it was very addictive to put the shapes together,"" he said on the phone from Seattle, where he now lives.

But creating a video game in Soviet Russia at the height of the Cold War was far from easy. It was only through the sheer brilliance of its design that Tetris was transformed from a quirky test program into a worldwide phenomenon.

Word of mouth

Although Tetris became immediately popular among programmers with access to an Electronika 60, the machine had no graphical capabilities -- and less memory than today's calculators. Pressed with requests to create a version of the game for the IBM PC, a more widespread computer with better graphics, Pajitnov assigned the job to Vadim Gerasimov, a 16-year-old student on a summer job at his office (today an engineer at Google). The game spread quickly. ""It was like a wood fire. Everyone in the Soviet Union who had a PC had Tetris on it,"" said Pajitnov.

Pajitnov wasn't making any money off the game, nor did he intend to. Ideas were owned by the state and the very concept of selling software as a product was unfamiliar to him. People were just sharing Tetris through word of mouth and by copying it onto floppy disks.

Then, Pajitnov heard rumors that the game might have crossed borders and was being played in other Eastern bloc countries. In 1986, he got a message via telex -- a forerunner of the fax machine -- from Robert Stein, a salesman for a Hungary-based software company called Andromeda. Stein, who had seen Tetris in Hungary, wanted to secure the rights to sell it as a computer game in the West. He offered significant money in advance.

""My English was really bad at that time, so I put together some kind of positive answer, saying we were very glad to receive the proposal and that some agreement could be made,"" said Pajitnov. He knew that doing business directly with a Western firm could have landed him in jail, even before making any money, so he started investigating how he could sell the rights to Tetris through the state.

Stein, however, interpreted his response as a green light and immediately started producing the game. But as he was preparing to launch, he received another telex from Elorg -- short for Electronorgtechnica, the Soviet organization that oversaw software and hardware exports. It said that the rights had not been officially granted and that his launch was illegal.

Eventually, Stein cleared the rights, and Tetris was released as a commercial PC title in the UK and the US in 1988. The game played up its Soviet origins through Kremlin-themed illustrations and Cyrillic characters. But the misunderstanding between Pajitnov and Stein showed how tricky it would be to export a video game from Soviet Russia to the West for the first time -- an issue that led to years of confusion and legal battles, and is even rumored to have landed on the desk of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.

The Game Boy

Tetris was selling well on computers, but the big money in the games sector was being made elsewhere: consoles. Henk Rogers, a Dutch video game developer and businessman living in Japan, was the first to realize that Tetris was a perfect match for the Game Boy, a new handheld system released by Nintendo in Japan in early 1989. The console was about to launch in North America and Europe too, and Rogers set out to convince the company to bundle a copy of the game in the box, a common practice outside of Japan.

""I made a handshake deal with Minoru Arakawa, the founder of Nintendo of America, to have Nintendo include Tetris in every Game Boy,"" said Rogers in a phone interview. ""He said, 'Why should I include Tetris? I have Mario.' And I said, 'If you want little boys to buy your Game Boy, then include Mario. But if you want everyone to buy your Game Boy, then you should include Tetris.'""

Rogers set out to obtain the necessary permissions, and soon realized what a challenge that would be. He had already published a version of Tetris in Japan, for the popular Nintendo Famicom home system, only to discover that there were half a dozen companies all claiming to own the rights to the game. ""So I got on a plane and went to Moscow on a tourist visa to track down the source of the rights, Elorg -- and talk my way into it,"" he said.

Once in Moscow, Rogers made little progress until he hired an interpreter, who swiftly took him to Elorg.

""She knew immediately where everything was, so that was fishy. They're not supposed to talk to foreigners, and I wasn't supposed to talk to the Russians, let alone people inside the government. So I broke all kinds of rules by being there. They interrogated me for two hours. I thought they were trying to figure out whether they were gonna send me to Siberia or not,"" he said.

But among the officials in the room was Alexey Pajitnov, who immediately took a liking to Rogers. ""Alexey was the only guy in the room who actually knew anything about games,"" Rogers recalled. ""I explained how business worked, and we became friends. A week later, I left Moscow with a signed agreement for Tetris on the Game Boy.""

The Game Boy version of Tetris sold 35 million units and helped the console become one of the most successful of all time. It is still considered by many -- Pajitnov included -- to be the best version of Tetris, and it created an unprecedented synergy between hardware and software, epitomizing the gaming mantra ""easy to learn, hard to master.""

Delayed royalties

Despite the game's success, Pajitnov was still not making any money from it. ""There was a lot of legal trouble, and when the question of ownership and the original source of the game came up, I decided that I wanted everything to go smoothly and I granted the rights to the Computer Center of the Soviet Academy of Sciences for 10 years,"" he said.

The legal trouble culminated in a skirmish between Nintendo and Atari over the home console rights for Tetris. A judge ruled in Nintendo's favor in late 1989, dealing a lethal blow to Atari, which had already produced hundreds of thousands of now useless copies of its version of the game, under the tagline ""Tetris: The Soviet Mind Game."" Nintendo took a different approach, opting for the slogan ""From Russia with fun.""

Pajitnov left Moscow for Seattle in 1991, with the help of his friend Henk Rogers. And when his deal over the rights expired in 1995, he finally started receiving royalties for the game. ""And they've been fine so far,"" he said.

Pajitnov and Rogers in 2018.

In 1996, Pajitnov and Rogers founded the Tetris Company, to handle licensing for Tetris and its spinoffs. In 2005, the Tetris Company bought Elorg -- which after the fall of the Soviet Union had transformed from a state-owned company into a private one -- gaining total control of all Tetris rights worldwide. The company has even standardized and trademarked the names and colors of every Tetris piece -- officially called Tetriminos , rather than the generic tetrominoes, although they have many unofficial nicknames

Tetris has been the subject of several scientific studies. One found that playing the game can be effective in fighting off cravings for food and even drugs, while another noted an increase in the thickness of some parts of the brain in people who had played regularly. Playing Tetris for prolonged periods of time can lead to players dreaming to about the falling pieces or interpreting real-world objects as tetrominoes and mentally re-arranging them -- a phenomenon known as ""the Tetris Effect.""

To date, Tetris has been released on over 65 platforms, a world record , with more than half a billion downloads on mobile devices, according to the Tetris Company. Pajitnov has personally worked on over 100 variants of the game.

The latest, released in early 2019 to coincide with the game's 35th anniversary, is an online multiplayer version called ""Tetris 99,"" which can be played by up to 99 players simultaneously. Since 2010, an eSports tournament based on the 1989 Nintendo Entertainment System version of Tetris has seen the world's best players gather in Portland, Oregon. Some of the matches, which can surpass 30 minutes in length, have garnered over 10 million views on YouTube.

""It hasn't lost any of its play value and nothing has come to replace Tetris,"" said Henk Rogers, explaining the game's enduring popularity.

""It's like 'Happy Birthday.' There have been lots of songs that come and go, but 'Happy Birthday' is it still always sung in the same way. Tetris has become the 'Happy Birthday' of computer games.""",2020-07-12,https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/tetris-video-game-history/index.html
Lisa Respers France,What August Alsina said after Jada Pinkett Smith and Will Smith's 'Red Table Talk',"(CNN) People are fascinated by August Alsina's ""entanglement"" with Jada Pinkett Smith, but the singer seems less than thrilled with all the attention.

Pinkett Smith and her husband of 23 years, actor Will Smith, confirmed during Friday's episode of her Facebook talk show ""Red Table Talk"" that she had been romantically involved with Alsina years ago.

The superstar couple said the relationship began during a period they had separated.

""I got into an entanglement with August,"" Pinkett Smith said during the talk.

In a recent interview with radio host Angela Yee, Alsina said he had been involved romantically with Pinkett Smith. Pinkett Smith has been married to Smith since 1997 and shares two children with him.

""I actually sat down with Will and had a conversation,"" Alsina said during his interview with Yee. ""Due to the transformation from their marriage to (a) life partnership that they have spoken on several times, and not involving romanticism, he gave me his blessing.""

Pinkett Smith said during her ""Red Table Talk"" that she began a friendship with Alsina four and a half years ago which developed into something more after she and Smith hit a rough patch in their relationship and agreed to amicably split.

But she denied that her husband had given Alsina permission to be involved with her, though she added that she understood why the young singer may have believed that to be the case.

""The only person that can give permission in that particular circumstance is myself,"" she said. ""I could actually see how he would perceive it as permission because we were separated amicably and I think he also wanted to make it clear that he's also not a homewrecker. Which he's not.""

She said the relationship ended, she and Smith reconciled and they are now at a place of ""unconditional love.""

The whole drama set social media afire and soon there were plenty of memes and conversation about the ""entanglement.""

On Friday Alsina responded on Twitter after actress Keke Palmer tweeted to set the record straight about whether they had been romantically involved.

Palmer denied they were when a follower shared a picture of Palmer and Alsina together and inquired about it.

After sharing his thoughts about that (and confirming that he and Palmer had not been a couple), Alsina tweeted what some took to be his frustration resulting from all the attention and hoopla.

He went on to add ""If you have something to say, say it w/ ya CHEST kids.""

""It's always very perplexing cause I real deal be showing people genuine love,"" he tweeted. ""Whole time that envy eating ya lil heart. Anyway, NEXT!!""

Alsina has not shied away from the drama.

A week before Pinkett Smith and her husband broke their silence, Alsina appeared to double down on his claim about the relationship in a lengthy Instagram post in which he wrote about a variety of topics.

In part he wrote ""A tower of truth can never fall, only a tower of lies can do that.""

""My truth is MY truth, & its mine to own,"" he wrote. ""There is no right or wrong here, it simply just IS. & I make room and have acceptance for your thoughts and opinions, regardless if I agree or not, you have that freedom to feel WHATEVER it is u feel because when you're at TRUE peace, all of the noise and chatter becomes that of a whisper.""

Analysis Julia Horowitz,Could the United Kingdom become an emerging market?,"London (CNN Business) Brexit and the coronavirus pandemic are reshaping the UK economy . Could it end up looking more like Turkey, Mexico and Argentina than France, Germany and the United States ?

Some analysts on Wall Street are beginning to wonder whether a volatile currency, declining global clout and a reliance on foreign investors could relegate the United Kingdom to ""emerging market"" status.

Bank of America suggested in a recent note to clients that it may be time to treat the British pound as an emerging market currency, citing Brexit and worsening debt dynamics as a result of Covid-19.

""We believe [the pound] is in the process of evolving into a currency that resembles the underlying reality of the British economy: small and shrinking,"" wrote BofA strategists Kamal Sharma and Myria Kyriacou.

There are reasons the demotion to emerging market status seems like a stretch. The pound is heavily traded, investors have maintained their faith in British institutions and there's high demand for debt issued by the country's government.

But what the comparisons make clear is that investors are bracing for a world in which the United Kingdom's standing is diminished.

""We don't think there's any risk that the UK is suddenly going to be viewed as an emerging market,"" said Thomas Pugh, UK economist at the research firm Capital Economics. But Brexit and the country's response to the pandemic, he said, ""will weigh on confidence.""

A sagging United Kingdom

The United Kingdom, which has one of the highest per capita Covid-19 death rates in the world, is battling a deep recession as a result of lockdowns aimed at containing the virus.

The Bank of England estimates the UK economy could shrink by 14% this year, its worst downturn in more than 300 years . The country also has fewer than six months to hammer out a new trade deal with the European Union, its biggest export market.

The pound has become extremely volatile amid uncertainty about the United Kingdom's path forward. It's now trading at $1.26, down more than 15% since the 2016 Brexit referendum.

Bank of America's Sharma and Kyriacou described its fluctuations as ""neurotic at best, unfathomable at worst."" The only currency that investors see as more unstable is the Brazilian real, they noted.

Brexit, they added, isn't helping. The country's departure from the European Union ""is likely to permanently alter the way in which investors view the pound,"" Sharma and Kyriacou said.

Investors also have to stomach concerns about Britain living beyond its means.

For years, Britain has carried a sizable current account deficit, which means it spends more on goods, services and investments abroad than it brings in at home. That's now coupled with a worsening fiscal deficit as the country borrows huge amounts to finance its pandemic recovery plans. As of May, Britain's debt was bigger than the size of the entire economy for the first time since 1963

A pedestrian walks a dog along a street in Manchester on July 7.

This week, finance minister Rishi Sunak unveiled another £30 billion ($37.8 billion) coronavirus stimulus package aimed at stemming a growing jobs crisis. The Institute for Fiscal Studies, an economic think tank, predicted that the latest measures would likely push this year's deficit further north of £300 billion ($378 billion), which it said would be ""easily"" the highest as a share of national income since World War II.

These dynamics make Britain vulnerable to a rise in interest rates. Rates are extremely low right now and expected to stay that way for a long time. But a spike in inflation could change that calculus.

Per Sharma and Kyriacou, Britain's so-called ""dual deficit"" — its current account deficit and its fiscal deficit taken together — will be wider next year than that of Mexico and Turkey, as well as the G20 average.

Emerging market Britain?

The United Kingdom is still the sixth largest economy in the world. On most counts, it falls squarely into the ""developed market"" camp.

The British pound makes up 4.4% of the world's currency reserves, according to data from the International Monetary Fund, suggesting that foreign central banks consider it a safe bet.

Investors also place a lot of trust in the country's institutions, including the Bank of England, which was founded more than 325 years ago. The central bank has moved swiftly during the current crisis, dropping interest rates and ramping up its bond-buying program

Those bond purchases are allowing the UK government to finance its recovery efforts as it borrows record amounts, while supporting demand for UK government bonds, known as gilts.

The yield on the benchmark 10-year bond is 0.14%, reflecting its status as a safe haven. The yield on Mexico's 10-year bond, for comparison, is 5.76%, while Turkey's is 12.43%, indicating a much higher risk premium.

""There doesn't seem to be any ... unwillingness to buy and hold UK debt,"" UBS economist Dean Turner said. Should demand falter, there's an expectation that the Bank of England would quickly step in.

Still, there is a growing view that the country's stature in global markets could be under threat over the longer term.

Britain's budget watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, said in March — before the country entered lockdown — that it expected economic output to be about 4% lower over the next 15 years than it would have been without Brexit, even if the United Kingdom and the European Union reach a ""typical"" free trade agreement.

And Britain is not impervious to an emerging market-style currency crisis, if history is any guide.

In 1976, the country — battling a run on the pound triggered by recession and concern about high levels of public spending — was forced to appeal for a nearly $4 billion IMF loan.

""You only have to go [back] to the '70s when there was last real currency crisis,"" Pugh said. ""It's certainly not unheard of.""",2020-07-10,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/10/business/uk-emerging-market/index.html
Hanna Ziady,The UK is reopening for business. London may never be the same,"London has seen more than its share of crises. The 2000-year old metropolis has endured an influenza pandemic, the Blitz and several financial meltdowns over just the past century.

Time and again, London has come roaring back, relying on a spirit of resilience and reinvention that is being summoned once more as the British capital seeks to recover from what may be this century's greatest upheaval: the coronavirus pandemic.

The spread of the virus and efforts to contain it turned one of the world's liveliest urban meccas into a virtual ghost town, driving millions of people out of the city's center and its financial district, and bringing commerce to a sudden halt.

Spectators at the New Year's Day Parade. Over 10,000 performers paraded from Piccadilly Circus to Parliament Square.

The scale of the shutdown would have been unimaginable just six months ago, when around 500,000 people poured into the area around Piccadilly Circus for the annual New Year's Day Parade and it was common to wait 90 minutes for a table at the busiest restaurants.

Then the pandemic hit. Virtually overnight, shops closed, tourists fled, offices and streets emptied out and the city's 9 million residents holed up at home. Nowhere was the standstill captured more acutely than in the mainstay of London city life: the Tube.

Underground journeys for the month of March tumbled 43% from the 106 million recorded in February, and plunged even further in April, during the height of lockdown, to just 5.7 million. Social distancing rules mean the Tube can only handle up to 15% of its normal traffic, according to London's mayor, Sadiq Khan.

The fallout from lockdown has been severe. London's economy is expected to contract nearly 17% this year, according to figures from the city government, a sharper drop than the 14% decline the Bank of England expects for the United Kingdom as a whole.

Companies in London are expected to shed some 460,000 jobs, or about 7% of the workforce, with manufacturing, construction, retail, and accommodation and food services the hardest hit. Employment is not expected to fully recover until 2022.

With transportation severely constrained, and a potential coronavirus vaccine still many months away, the people and companies that have made London into a hub for real estate, finance, the arts, hospitality and technology are desperately trying to reinvent themselves in hopes of surviving the pandemic.

One sign of progress: pubs, restaurants and hair salons can reopen on Saturday, provided they follow social distancing guidelines.

The physical city

What the pandemic means for London's sprawling collection of corporate headquarters is still unclear. Paul Cheshire, professor of economic geography at the London School of Economics, is quick to dismiss the suggestion that the office is dead as ""nonsense,"" arguing that what happens in the long term will be less dramatic.

More people will spend more time working from home, or in decentralized office spaces, but this won't abolish companies' demand for locations in the city center, which have been shown to increase productivity and facilitate idea sharing, he said.

Commuters walk across London Bridge on February 3, 2020. The city went into lockdown on March 24.

What happens to real estate, which accounts for 15% of London's economy, matters a great deal to the city.

The government has protected commercial tenants from eviction through August, but those measures will at some point expire. According to property management platform, Re-Leased, just 45% of commercial rents for the third quarter had been paid by early July. But that was an improvement on the previous three months and ""a sign of the capital's resilience,"" said Re-Leased CEO, Tom Wallace.

The pandemic has accelerated existing trends around agile working and the desire for more flexible office space, where several different companies share meeting and social areas, as well as facilities such as showers, bike racks and kitchens.

Companies ""want their offices to count,"" said Darren Richards, head of real estate at British Land, a leading UK property company. He predicts that greater numbers of older offices in need of refurbishment will likely be released onto the market in the future, as companies prioritize higher quality spaces.

British Land owns 22.8 million square feet of commercial real estate, including 7.1 million square feet of offices in areas like Broadgate, Paddington, Mayfair and Regent's Place. It said that its tenants are currently not seeking to get rid of office space. Businesses still ""want space fundamentally,"" though they are contemplating how much and for what purpose, Richards said.

Still, the penetration of online shopping during the coronavirus will mean a reduction in brick-and-mortar outlets, which could radically alter the landscape of London's vast retail space and create yet more uncertainty for the city's real estate market. ""What would have happened over five years is happening over months,"" said Richards.

The City, reinvented

London's financial heart, referred to as the City of London, has a proven track record of reinvention.

Storied institutions like Lloyd's of London, the Bank of England and the London Stock Exchange have been around for centuries, withstanding radical social, political and economic turmoil

Today, the City is home to well over 250 international banks and handles 43% of global foreign exchange trading, according to the Bank for International Settlements. Financial services contributed £65 billion ($81 billion) to the London economy in 2018, or about 15%, figures from City Hall show.

And despite four years of uncertainty over Brexit, the United Kingdom has been Europe's top location for international financial services investment over the past two decades, with London claiming the bulk of those flows.

People observe social distancing as they look out at the skyline of London's financial district on June 9.

""London's dominance as the preeminent European financial center remains unrivaled,"" said Omar Ali, EY's UK financial services managing partner.

UK financial services will continue to be a leading recipient of overseas investment even after the pandemic, according to an EY survey conducted in April.

Investors ranked the availability of capital as the most important consideration influencing their future location choices, followed by safety and security measures introduced to prevent a future major crisis, whether that relates to health, the environment or cyber security.

London's dominance as the preeminent European financial center remains unrivaled."" Omar Ali, EY

There are factors working against the City, however. The UK government's handling of the coronavirus crisis has been widely criticized, and business and consumer confidence remains depressed.

""We failed to take advantage of the fact that we're an island and didn't move fast enough. There was a lot of complacency and hubris,"" said Richard Burge, the CEO of the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

The government's approach to negotiating its post-Brexit trading relationship with the European Union has also drawn reproach. A group of business leaders warned this week that Britain's decision not to extend the current transition period beyond the end of the year is a "" huge gamble .""

The City of London may yet be tested. Crucially, there is currently no guarantee that UK financial firms will retain access to the European Union after this year — an export market worth £26 billion ($32.4 billion) in 2018, according to the Office for National Statistics, or 40% of the sector's total value.

Still good for startups

As London seeks to retain its status as a leading global business center, the city's technology sector, which boomed following the global financial crisis, could help.

Google, GOOGL Facebook FB Amazon AMZN andhave big offices in London, and startup investment has continued during the pandemic, suggesting that losses in real estate and financial services could be made up in the tech sector. Startups based in London have raised $4 billion in venture capital since the start of the year, more than Paris, Stockholm, Berlin and Tel Aviv combined, according to figures compiled in June by Tech Nation and Dealroom.

""It's a global arms race but London is still ahead,"" said Brent Hoberman, the co-founder of Founders Factory, an accelerator. ""I think London absolutely remains as the global magnet for tech talent,"" he added, attributing its attractiveness to world class educational institutions, diverse culture and early entrepreneur success stories.

Lockdowns have only accelerated the adoption of digital technologies in everyday life, and boosted information and health technology companies, playing to London's strengths, said Suranga Chandratillake, a partner at Balderton Capital, one of Europe's leading early stage venture capital investors with stakes in companies such as Citymapper, Vivino, Lyst and Revolut.

London absolutely remains the global magnet for tech talent."" Brent Hoberman, Founders Factory

The city is home to a large share of digital consumer businesses, Chandratillake said, including online grocer Ocado, digital banks such as Revolut and Monzo, and food delivery companies such as Deliveroo and Gousto.

London also boasts an outsized share of technology companies in areas such as cyber security and workforce management, now servicing armies of home workers. And the coronavirus has boosted investment into health technology, benefiting London and the United Kingdom more broadly.

""The city is the most genetically diverse in the world, almost all citizens use the same health system and there are a variety of tech projects, both government-funded within the NHS [National Health Service] and privately-funded startups, that have grown rapidly against this backdrop and stand in a very strong position,"" Chandratillake told CNN Business.

Zoom ZM The pandemic could even help to catalyze new ways of doing business. London & Partners, the trade and investment body for London, said it recently organized a trade mission via, where a group of human resources tech entrepreneurs pitched their businesses to potential investors and customers in New York.

""If we assume a reduction in travel, it points towards naturally digital sectors in which London has existing strengths,"" said managing director of strategy and corporate affairs, Allen Simpson.

Saving London's culture

While London's tech and finance sectors look set to weather the current crisis, social distancing and a reduction in travel spells disaster for its once booming arts and culture scene, which helps attract tourists, ambitious young professionals and investment. For theaters, museums, restaurants and bars, it's an existential threat.

Leisure and hospitality ""really strategically matter,"" said Simpson. ""People come from all over the world partly because London is a cool place to live.""

Nearly 40% of Londoners are born outside the United Kingdom, making London one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the world. It is home to 1 million EU nationals and was the world's third most visited city in 2018, narrowly behind Paris and Bangkok, according to Mastercard.

Last year, London boasted 21.7 million overseas visitors who spent £15.7 billion ($19.6 billion) on the local economy and supported 250,000 jobs, according to the Office for National Statistics.

""That revenue keeps certain things alive in London,"" said UK Tourism Alliance director Kurt Janson. ""The West End theaters couldn't survive if not for overseas visitors.""

London's West End theater district on a Saturday evening in April.

In an open letter to the government signed by UK Theatre and nearly 100 actors, writers and directors, the Society of London Theatre worried that ""British theatre is on the brink of ruin.""

""Theatres do not have the money to operate viably with physical distancing,"" they said. The industry has called for an emergency relief fund, ongoing wage support and more help for freelancers and self-employed artists.

Museums, galleries and London's iconic tourist attractions are also at risk. Several have not yet announced plans to reopen, despite being allowed to do so on Saturday. In a joint statement issued late last month, directors of museums such as the Tate, British Museum and National Gallery said it was a question of ""how and when we can open our doors again in a financially sustainable manner, for the long term.""

The National Gallery has said it will reopen on July 8, while the Tate Britain and Tate Modern will reopen on July 27 and the Tower of London on July 10.

On Sunday, the government announced a £1.57 billion ($1.96 billion) rescue package, mostly in the form of grants, to ""provide a lifeline"" to the arts and culture sector. Details of how the bailout will be distributed still need to be ironed out, but it was welcomed by industry leaders. ""This is a vital next step on the road to recovery for the industry and will help to support and sustain the UK's vibrant arts ecology through this crisis,"" Alex Beard, CEO of the Royal Opera House, said in a statement.

London's pubs and restaurants face an even greater threat from social distancing.

Already, Michelin-starred Texture and the upmarket Indian Accent, a Mayfair outpost of the Delhi original, have permanently closed. They are unlikely to be the only casualties.

Murat Kilic, the owner of Amber, in the hip East Aldgate neighborhood, told CNN Business that he is not confident about reopening. Amber is opening its doors on Saturday for the first time in nearly four months, but at less than half its previous capacity.

Kilic worries that when government support is wound down in October, he could risk eviction unless his landlord agrees to temporarily reduce monthly rent payments.

For Joseph Ryan, business looks set to boom over the July 4 weekend at his two pubs in London. Howl at the Moon and The White Hart have far more bookings than usual, Ryan said, but he is less optimistic about the longer term outlook.

Indoor capacity has been cut in half, seating is now mandatory, wooden panels have been erected between tables, and staff will be wearing masks and gloves.

""We're confident about this weekend, but thereafter we're not so sure,"" said Ryan. ""The novelty might wear off.""

The shopping and entertainment hub, Covent Garden, on July 1, 2020.

Whether Londoners are quick to return to bars and eateries remains to be seen. Worryingly, household income and expenditure are set to tumble by 5.5% and 12% respectively this year, and are not expected to reach 2019 levels before at least 2023, according to City Hall.

How quickly a new London emerges depends on the coronavirus: if cases continue to fall and social distancing is eased further, the economic outlook will brighten. A second wave could prompt further lockdowns and all the economic pain that brings.

London will find ""workarounds"" to the immediate challenges posed by the virus, said Burge of the London Chamber, from becoming a city of cyclists and walkers to standing outside bars in the drizzle. ""That's what we do,"" he said. ""London will come through.""

Sarah Dean,Britain is the worst-hit country outside of the US and Brazil. It STILL won't wear masks,"London (CNN) Walk into any busy store in England or board a train on London's cramped underground system and you will see dozens of people unmasked. And you can forget about face coverings at recently reopened pubs... that's about as likely as a free pint of beer.

This despite the UK being one of the world's worst-hit countries by coronavirus -- it stands third behind Brazil and the United States -- with almost 45,000 fatalities.

And apart from catastrophic death tolls, the three countries at the top of the pandemic chart are those in which people resist wearing masks.

Now, in the same week the World Health Organization confirms there is ""emerging evidence"" of airborne transmission of the coronavirus, senior scientists are urging Britons to take up mask wearing, as two new reports highlight the potential effectiveness of facial coverings.

""The UK is way behind many countries in terms of wearing masks,"" the head of Britain's national academy of sciences, the Royal Society, Venki Ramakrishnan said Tuesday. He claimed not wearing a mask should be regarded as antisocial as drink driving and reasoned that there is a ""growing body of evidence that wearing a mask will help protect others -- and might even protect you.""

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson -- who was hospitalized in intensive care with the virus -- has not previously worn a mask in public until this week.

The PM wore a mask for the first time in public on Friday, in his Uxbridge constituency, west of London.

His comments came as a review of global scientific research on mask wearing was published by a multi-disciplinary group convened by the Royal Society -- Data Evaluation and Learning for Viral Epidemics (DELVE).

And in the United States, a new study showed that one of the main drivers of cases now could be ""silent spreaders,"" or people who are asymptomatic or presymptomatic.

The report, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found that asymptomatic or presymptomatic hosts could be responsible for half of cases, highlighting how masks could be useful in preventing the spread of the virus.

""We have now identified convincing decades-old and apparently forgotten evidence, from the time when surgical masks were made of cloth and were reusable, showing that they help to prevent transmission of airborne infectious agents. There is now even some evidence that masks might directly benefit the wearer,"" its author, Paul Edelstein, Emeritus Professor of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, said.

Edlestein explained: ""There are people without symptoms going about their daily business who are unknowingly breathing out droplets that are carrying the virus. If they had their faces covered the majority of those droplets would be caught before they can infect other people. Wearing face coverings can help save lives and prevent disabling illnesses.""

So if the basics are ""simple to understand,"" as Edlestein put it, why is Britain so reluctant to latch onto masks?

Becoming an outlier

second report , by the Royal Society's SET-C (Science in Emergencies Tasking Covid-19 group) and the British Academy, attempts to explain. It looks at the socio-behavioral factors that could affect the uptake of mask wearing -- and points to how important clear and consistent government policy and messaging around masks is for compliance.

It found that in late April in the UK around 25% of people wore face masks or coverings in public places. This is staggeringly low compared to 83.4% in Italy and 63.8% in Spain in the same period.

People wear face masks in Barcelona, Spain, where those who don't do so in a public space face a 100 euro fine.

April was a month when the UK saw its official daily hospital death toll climb as high as 980. The government only started reporting deaths in all settings, including care homes, at the end of the month. On April 28, at a Downing Street daily briefing, Deputy Chief Scientific Adviser Angela McLean said the government's scientific advisory group SAGE had concluded there was ""weak evidence of a small effect"" in which face masks could prevent an infected person passing coronavirus on to someone else.

At the time, the UK was also battling a critical personal protective equipment (PPE) shortage , with fears that wide public use of face masks could lead to a shortage for healthcare workers.

In the US, where a political and cultural war on masks is now playing out while the virus continues to surge, the Trump administration's top public health experts recently defended their decision to recommend against wearing masks in the pandemic's earliest days, saying it was necessary to prevent a run on equipment that was in short supply.

""I don't regret that,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said during congressional testimony last week. ""At that time, there was a paucity of equipment that our health care providers needed... we did not want to divert masks and PPE away from them.""

Current World Health Organization guidance , updated on June 5, advises governments to encourage the general public to wear masks where there is widespread transmission and physical distancing is difficult, such as on public transport, in shops or in other confined or crowded environments.

Revellers pack a street outside bars in the Soho area of London on July 4, as restrictions are further eased.

The only places where face masks are currently mandatory in England is on public transport, a measure brought in on June 15, and in healthcare settings. According to the government's website, public transport ""differs from enclosed spaces like shops, for example, where people can more easily go outside if social distancing is not possible.""

""People may rightly ask why you have to wear a mask on a train but not in a shop. If guidance is inconsistent people will follow their own preferences,"" Ramakrishnan said. He argued British people might ""not really understand the benefits or are not convinced of them.""

There have also been cracks in a UK-wide approach on masks, with the devolved nations having the power to decide their own coronavirus measures. Northern Ireland is in line with England in mandating masks on public transport but not shops. Scotland has gone one step further and made it mandatory to wear face coverings in shops from July 10. In Wales, masks are not mandatory in shops or on public transport.

In Parliament on Tuesday, UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the government will review guidance for whether the public should wear face masks in supermarkets and retail shops in England.

When asked for a review timeframe, a government spokesperson at the Department of Health told CNN: ""As we ease lockdown measures, face coverings can help us protect each other and reduce the spread of the disease if people are suffering from coronavirus, but not showing symptoms. We continue to advise individuals to wear face coverings in enclosed public spaces where social distancing is not possible.

""Everyone should maintain a 2-meter distance wherever possible. Where this is not possible wearing a face covering is one of the ways people can manage risk at a 1-meter distance.""

Although the uptake of face masks or coverings may have increased in the UK since late April, the Set-C report highlights how many countries implemented a policy requiring the general public to wear face masks and coverings in all public places much earlier, by mid-March 2020.

Taiwan, South Korea and mainland China, all places with widespread mask use, have seen greater success in preventing major outbreaks or reining them in once they begin.

As second and third waves begin to emerge in countries that have eased up coronavirus restrictions, mask wearing has up until this week been shunned and even ridiculed by the leaders of the worst hit countries -- the US and Brazil -- as they struggle to escape a devastating first wave of the pandemic.

President Donald Trump had refused to wear a mask in public for months until a visit to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Saturday. This came after some of the President's aides practically begged him to agree. It is hoped it will encourage skeptical Trump supporters to do the same. Meanwhile, President Jair Bolsonaro is being sued for removing his mask during an interview in which he announced that he has the coronavirus.

The University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) gives two versions of forecasts for the US: one in which everyone wears masks, and one in which they don't. This week the IHME model projected as many 208,000 American coronavirus deaths by November 1, but just under 163,000 if most people wear a face mask to help contain the spread of the virus.

Why the resistance?

""To understand why people don't wear face coverings it is essential to examine behavioural factors such as the public's understanding about masks and how to wear and re-use cloth coverings,"" said Melinda Mills, Director of the Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science at the University of Oxford and lead author on the SET-C report.

""What is clear is that it isn't the public's fault for not wearing masks in the UK. Rather, consistent policies and effective public messaging is vital, which have even differed across England, Scotland and Wales,"" Mills argued.

Notably, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson -- who was hospitalized in intensive care with the virus -- had not, until Friday, worn a mask in public, yet Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon had.

First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon wears a Tartan face mask as she visits a retail park last month in Edinburgh.

Mills said people in countries like Italy and Spain, without a previous history of mask wearing, have ""rapidly adopted face coverings during the Covid-19 period largely because the authorities provided them with a consistent policy and clear guidelines to understand why they should wear them.""

Spain, for example, which has recorded more than 28,000 deaths, has legally required everyone over the age of six to wear face masks indoors and outdoors in public spaces when a minimum two-meter distance is not possible since May 21. In June, the country's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez ordered that this remain the case even after the country's state of emergency ended on June 21.

The Set-C report, which states consistent and effective public messaging is ""vital"" to public adherence to wearing face masks and coverings, highlights a UK government tweet on June 27. The report said the ""face coverings make the shop safer"" message in the tweet was good for its ""altruism"" message but bad because it focused only on protecting others and not self protection. The campaign image featured an older woman, who the report says is already in the vulnerable group and less likely to break the face covering advice.

The report also concludes that a lack of uptake of face masks and coverings in the UK may also be attributed to factors such as an ""over-reliance on an evidence-based medicine approach,"" ""inconsistent and changing advice from supranational organizations (WHO, European Center for Disease Prevention and Control),"" and ""supply concerns of PPE shortages of surgical face masks.""

It's not too late

""As the government equivocates, unlike our European neighbours, the British public may end up being the 'control group' for the face mask experiment the government has been demanding all along,"" scientist Dr. Babak Javid wrote in April, in an opinion piece for The Guardian newspaper, as he urged Britons to take up mask wearing.

Since then, the consultant in infectious diseases at Cambridge University hospitals in England and professor at the Tsinghua University School of Medicine in Beijing has moved to the US to take up a new post as associate professor of experimental medicine at the University of California San Francisco. He's noticed masks are ""much more visible"" in the US than the UK, and he puts that down to the ""establishment"" unifying around masks early on in the pandemic.

In the US ""many shops here have not hesitated in mandating masks if you want to go and use their store... shops don't seem to be suffering as a result,"" he said in a phone interview with CNN.

However, mask wearing is by no means universal across the US, a country where rebellion runs through its political DNA. Different states have enacted different measures and passionate ""anti-mask"" protesters are rebelling against mandatory face coverings . On April 3, Trump announced the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was urging Americans to wear a mask when they leave their homes. But he declared he wouldn't be wearing one himself. ""With the masks, it is going to be really a voluntary thing,"" the President said. ""You can do it. You don't have to do it. I am choosing not to do it.""

Javid believes the UK has indeed become somewhat of a mask experiment ""control group,"" ""certainly compared with most European countries,"" although he points out the Netherlands and the Nordic countries also have very low uptake of face mask use. There are confounders, he said, ""because of the UK's very long lockdown and... because the UK was hit very hard... case counts are really dramatically falling in the UK now, so it's hard to disentangle.""

""I think there is reasonably compelling evidence that states that mandated masks earlier cut down their transmission rates more quickly in the upswing phase of the outbreak,"" he added.

Javid thinks the UK government's attempt to make the mask mandate as loose as possible has meant ""a very muddled and fairly watered-down message.""

""They were so worried about securing PPE supplies, so then the focus shifted to face coverings and the reality is not all face coverings are created equal. That's just the bare bones truth, a loose scarf is always going to be less effective than a well-fitted, well-made cloth mask,"" Javid argued.

""If you are going to have a lowest common denominator message that any face covering will do it's then hard to hand on your heart and say this is going to protect you. Whereas, actually, a well made cloth mask will protect you. I think that's incontrovertible.""

He said ""in terms of economics masks are one of the most cost-effective interventions we can have"" in the fight to stop the spread of coronavirus. He is not in favor of ""perpetual lockdown"" and believes masks are one way of trying to get out of lockdown quicker but they are not the beginning and the end of the pandemic. ""This isn't a simple solution, it's just one part of a package.""

Customers enjoy their drinks in Soho, London, earlier in July as pubs, restaurants, hotels and hairdressers in England reopen.

After a deadly first wave of the virus, Javid believes ""it's not too late"" for the UK. ""Now is a great time to increase our mask usage because it might allow us to open up even more and more safely."" This is a claim echoed by Royal Society President Ramakrishnan, who said: ""The virus has not been eliminated, so as we lift lockdown and people increasingly interact with each other we need to use every tool we have to reduce the risk of a second wave of infection.""

On July 4, England's pubs and restaurants swung open their doors after three months of lockdown. Prime Minister Johnson urged drinkers to behave responsibly, but footage last weekend showed large crowds outside city pubs with no social distancing and few revelers wearing masks. Since then at least three venues have had to shut again, after some customers tested positive for Covid-19 following their visit that weekend.

Will we ever see Brits wearing masks in pubs? ""The reason why pubs and clubs are higher risk activities is because you are much more likely to be engaging in speech and we know that speech is associated with transmission,"" Javid said. ""Realistically how many people will wear a mask, take it off for a quick sip of their pint and then put it back on again straight away? I just can't see that happening.""",2020-07-12,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/12/health/britain-masks-intl-gbr/index.html
Julia Horowitz,Why it pays to be a chain during a pandemic,"A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business' Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here

London (CNN Business) Companies often talk about the benefits of scale. And during a pandemic, it appears bigger can be better.

What's happening: A new analysis by Bank of America found that spending at big restaurant chains has ""largely recovered,"" while small chains and independent eateries remain under pressure. It pointed toas one player with a big presence whose shares could rise over the longer term.

""Larger chains [are] flexing [the] benefits of size,"" analysts Gregory Francfort and JonMichael Shekian told clients.

Chipotle's stock is up 33% this year. The company's investments in technology — one of such advantages — have helped it pivot to delivery and takeout, with digital sales shooting up 81% in the first quarter. Meanwhile, its commitment to food safety protocols following past scandals allowed it to quickly implement safeguards specific to the coronavirus.

Why it matters: Scale allows companies to paper over issues at struggling locations and spread out costs associated with new safety measures. That flexibility could be crucial as Covid-19 cases rise across parts of the United States, forcing at least two dozen states to pause or roll back reopening plans.

Still, size isn't a panacea. Walgreens said Thursday that it's cutting 4,000 jobs at its UK pharmacy chain Boots, which kept most of its stores open through lockdown. The company cited a ""dramatic decline"" in footfall.

UK shoppers are making a tentative return to shops as lockdown restrictions ease, according to a report Friday from the British Retail Consortium and ShopperTrak, a research firm.

But the country's High Streets, which host the top chains, remain under strain. Footfall declined by nearly 65% year-on-year in June. As non-essential stores began to reopen in second part of the month, traffic improved — but was still down 58% compared to 2019.

Governments are frantically trying to get people to feel comfortable shopping and dining out again. Earlier this week, UK finance minister Rishi Sunak announced that meals at participating restaurants, cafes and pubs will be discounted by up to £10 ($12.61) per head from Monday to Wednesday for the month of August.

The path the virus takes could dictate the success of these efforts, however. In the United States, high-frequency data indicates that the number of seated diners at restaurants has been sliding since the July 4 holiday weekend as cases shoot up in some states.

There are signs of a pullback in activity even in states that have not reimposed restrictions, Andrew Hunter of Capital Economics told clients this week. That indicates that fears about the virus could outweigh messaging from the government — which would hit chains and independent stores alike.

Demand for oil could be hit by a rise in new infections

Oil supply hit a nine-year low in June as OPEC, its allies and producers in the United States pulled back to meet diminished demand for energy, the International Energy Agency said in a report released Friday.

That's helped push Brent crude futures, the global benchmark for oil prices, back above $40 per barrel. But the agency warned that the recent rise in coronavirus cases and the return of partial lockdowns ""introduces more uncertainty into the forecast.""

""While the oil market has undoubtedly made progress since 'Black April,' the large, and in some countries, accelerating number of Covid-19 cases is a disturbing reminder that the pandemic is not under control and the risk to our market outlook is almost certainly to the downside,"" the IEA said.

The agency now expects demand to plunge by 7.9 million barrels per day this year, a slightly smaller decline than forecast in its previous report.

The April to June period wasn't quite as bad as expected, it said, with demand rebounding ""strongly"" in China and India this spring. In China, transport fuel deliveries actually surpassed 2019 levels in April and May.

That said: Globally, demand for transport fuel is still ""much lower"" than it was one year ago, per the IEA.

And it's difficult to predict the effect of a virus resurgence in some regions. One one hand, a spike in cases could push more people to use cars, which would prop up fuel demand. But it could also just serve to reduce the amount of people moving around, limiting demand for energy.

Watch this space: Demand could also take a hit if governments enact large-scale clean energy programs as part of their economic recovery plans. The International Energy Agency hosted a summit Thursday with 40 government ministers to discuss how to reduce global emissions while boosting the economy.

A 'dangerous new normal' for the US job market

Week after week, the number of initial unemployment claims filed by Americans has declined. But the overall scale of applications for jobless benefits has remained stubbornly high, feeding fears among economists that the recovery is running into trouble.

The latest: Initial claims for the week ending July 4 came in at 1.3 million , down slightly from 1.4 million the previous week. That's well below the apex of nearly 6.9 claims reached in late March.

But Daniel Zhao, senior economist at Glassdoor, expressed concern about a ""dangerous new normal.""

""The decline in initial claims appears to be stalling out, with well over a million initial [unemployment insurance] claims being filed every week,"" he said in a blog post Thursday. ""This level of [unemployment insurance] claims, almost double the pre-crisis record, was unthinkable just a few months ago.""

James Knightley, chief international economist at ING, told clients that jobless claims have proved ""far stickier than most analysts thought likely as the reopening got underway.""

""Unfortunately we don't expect to see meaningful declines from these huge numbers anytime soon,"" Knightley said.

The numbers should bolster Congress' resolve to pass additional stimulus measures, which are currently locked in partisan negotiations, said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM. But he warned that ""fiscal fatigue"" appears to be taking hold.

Mary Ilyushina,Protests erupt in Russia's Far East after arrest of governor over years-old murders,"Moscow (CNN) Thousands of Russians protested on the streets in the country's remote Far Eastern territory of Khabarovsk on Saturday after their governor was arrested and flown to Moscow on charges for years-old murders, in a detention criticized as a politically motivated move by President Vladimir Putin's government.

Live feeds of the protests posted to social media from the event showed people chanting: ""This is our land"" and ""Putin must resign,"" while demanding Khabarovsk Governor Sergey Furgal be released and brought back to the territory.

State-run media TASS reported on Thursday that Furgal had been arrested, while a video posted to YouTube by the Russian state's Investigative Committee showed the governor being pulled from his vehicle by masked officers in fatigues, who then pat him down and put him in a van before driving away.

Khabarovsk Governor Sergey Furgal is escorted into a police van after a court hearing in Moscow on Friday.

The arrest comes less than two weeks after the country gave Putin the green light to serve beyond his existing term limits, in a referendum on constitutional reforms that could now see the leader cement his power until 2036.

Furgal on Friday appeared in court in Moscow, charged with orchestrating the murders of two businessmen in 2004 and 2005 and the attempted murder of another, according to an unnamed law enforcement quoted by TASS. Furgal denied all charges. The court ordered him detained until September 9. Four other people were arrested in November in connection to the alleged murders and later testified against Furgal, according to TASS.

Laura Smith-Spark,Trump ally battles a liberal challenger. Poland's deep divisions on show in presidential run-off vote,"Szczecin, Poland (CNN) Poland is a country deeply divided over cultural issues, and the direction the former Soviet bloc nation should take next: does it want to be a European-style liberal democracy, or does it take a more authoritarian path?

The government's erosion of gay rights has put it on a collision course with Europe, as have its radical reforms to the courts. These changes are viewed by other European Union leaders as having politicized the judiciary and undermined the rule of law.

Now the country will go to the polls Sunday for a second-round vote in what could be the country's most consequential presidential election in decades. The outcome could shape Poland's future direction within the European Union and reverberate well beyond its borders.

The battle between the remaining candidates -- populist incumbent Andrzej Duda, backed by the ruling Law and Justice party (PiS), and his more liberal challenger, Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski, of the center-right Civic Platform party -- has become increasingly contentious.

US President Donald Trump walks with his Polish counterpart Andrzej Duda before a press conference at the White House last month.

President Duda came out on top in the first round on June 28 with 43.5% of the ballots cast, according to the National Electoral Commission, while Trzaskowski, who entered the race only a few weeks ago, took about 30.5% of the vote. Turnout was high, at over 64%.

But observers predict a much closer second round, as the pair fight to pass the vital 50% threshold by winning over voters who backed candidates now out of the race.

During campaigning, Duda -- who met with US President Donald Trump at the White House last month -- has sought to mobilize his more conservative, largely rural base with appeals to traditional Catholic values and a promise to maintain popular social welfare policies, such as a child allowance and lower pension age.

as an ""ideology"" worse than Soviet-era communism sparked wide criticism, prompting Duda to But comments in which he described LGBTQ rightsas an ""ideology"" worse than Soviet-era communism sparked wide criticism, prompting Duda to tweet that his words had been ""put out of context"" as part of a dirty political fight.

""I truly believe in diversity and equality,"" he said, before adding: ""At the same time, beliefs of any minority cannot be imposed on a majority under the false pretense of tolerance.""

Presidential candidate Rafal Trzaskowski delivers a speech to locals and supporters during a campaign rally on July 7 in Gniezno, Poland.

Trzaskowski, who has previously served as an opposition minister and member of the European Parliament in Brussels, told CNN the election was important because ""the current government is monopolizing all the power"" and attacking key institutions.

""We need a break, we need a balance of power where the president of the Republic can cooperate with the government as needed -- for instance, when it comes to restoring good relations with the European Union -- but who is ready to veto legislation, for instance, that meddles with the rule of law,"" he said Wednesday in Szczecin, northwest Poland, where he was holding a campaign rally.

The government wants to focus debate solely on the LGBTQ issue, Trzaskowski said. As mayor of Warsaw, he said, ""I was always standing next to those who are marginalized. Disabled people, people of minorities, people are sent to the margins of society by this government.""

And if reelected, Duda is likely to continue to rubber-stamp the agenda shaped by PiS leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski, Piotr Buras, head of the Warsaw office of the European Council on Foreign Relations, told CNN.

Basic rights

LGBTQ protesters rallied in the capital, Warsaw, on Thursday against Duda's position on gay rights.

Just on Monday, Duda signed a draft amendment to the Constitution which, if approved, would bar the adoption of a child by a same-sex couple, saying his goal was to ""support the Polish family, protect Polish children.""

Trzaskowski also said in recent days that he's against the adoption of children by same-sex couples but has previously committed to supporting LGBTQ rights.

Trzaskowski supporter Jakub Lipczinsky, who attended the rally Wednesday in Szczecin, told CNN he was ""deeply concerned about what's happening with our basic rights"" at the hands of the current government.

""I have to say that I have never seen such a reckless attitude against our beliefs, our values,"" he said. ""And it is with such an arrogance. And so it is of utmost importance for us to stop this process of breaking law. If our candidate won the election, it would be a great step toward the improvement of this political situation in our country.""

Lipczinsky said he believed in respecting other people's views on their sexuality and their right to express themselves freely. ""Once your basic right to express yourself and your sexuality is broken it is difficult to still speak of a democracy,"" he said.

Another Trzaskowski supporter, Hannah Nikolaiczyk, told CNN the politician represented change that was much needed.

""It is important that Poland is not closed and separated from other countries,"" she said. ""It is important to work with them. It's important to see the change that is about to happen and I hope that Poles see that as well.""

Nikolaiczyk said she was motivated by concerns over LGBT rights and the constitution, but also issues such as health care and its approach to Europe. ""I think it is important to be open instead of closing and doing everything against connections with other countries,"" she said.

Andrzej Krasnitzky, also at the rally, described Duda as ""like a puppet on a string in the hands of Kaczynski"" and said he feared that after another five years with him in power ""our democracy will completely be destroyed.""

President Andrzej Duda delivers a speech during a campaign rally on July 4 in Wroclaw, Poland.

Others disagree, saying Duda and the ruling coalition are carrying out much-needed reforms.

Jakub, a 48-year-old Duda supporter in Warsaw who declined to give CNN his last name, said: ""I vote for Duda because I want to ensure continuity of government so that the current government can continue reforms. This government has evened out the social divide in Poland and President Duda is necessary, so that what was done would not be wasted.""

Duda's campaign has not yet responded to a request for comment on claims that the President has undermined the rule of law in Poland, eroded gay rights and rubber-stamped the PiS agenda.

Collision course with Europe

Although cultural issues have dominated campaigning, the outcome of the election has wider ramifications for Europe.

As one of the largest economies in the bloc, a big player in central Europe and a major beneficiary of EU funding, Poland should have clout.

But if Duda is reelected, Poland is likely to remain ""sitting on the sidelines in Europe,"" said Milan Nic, of the German Council on Foreign Relations, ""not playing its full weight... and seen as simply on a different wavelength to Germany and the rest of western Europe"" on issues such as climate policy and energy, thanks to its reliance on coal.

Trzaskowski told CNN he wanted to see Poland back at the table. ""Poland and this government are completely marginalized within the European Union. So it's not treated that seriously by the big powers,"" he said.

If Poland continues on its current path, in which the rule of law has been undermined by a politicization of the judiciary and public media, fellow EU member states may try to rein it in by attaching conditionality to EU funding, Buras suggested. But the PiS has until now been emboldened by the example of Hungary, where Viktor Orban has imposed an increasingly authoritarian rule in defiance of the EU.

Gerald Knaus, chairman of the European Stability Initiative think tank, said this election could be a turning point.

""One of the most important issues is the relationship between Poland and what has been the framework for the most successful period in Polish history -- EU membership,"" he told CNN from Berlin.

""The position of the PiS, which Duda has been supporting in recent years, is that Poland can remain a full member of the EU and can benefit and continue to benefit more than any other countries from structural assistance while charting an independent course on issues like the rule of law.""

Looking beyond Europe, both candidates are keen to maintain strong ties with the United States, which has troops stationed in Poland and is a longstanding ally.

Duda has forged a tight relationship with Trump since the US President visited Warsaw in 2017.

Trzaskowski, on the other hand, tweeted on July 1 that he would be speaking with former US President Barack Obama that evening ""about the importance of Polish democracy within the European Union and the significance of the U.S.-Polish alliance.""

What is the path to victory?

Despite his apparent momentum, Trzaskowski faces an uphill struggle to claim victory on Sunday based on the first-round tallies.

Duda has presided over a period during which Poland's economy has been in very good shape, said Buras, in part because of reforms enacted by the government since it was elected in 2015. And his message to voters is that the very close cooperation between president and government is in the interests of Poland and should continue.

Duda's harsh language on LGBT issues appears to be an attempt to mobilize the so-called ""silent majority"" by painting Trzaskowski ""as someone who, once elected, will be a source of cultural Armageddon,"" Buras said, although this approach may have reached its limit.

In Sunday's vote, Trzaskowski is likely to garner support from those who previously backed third-placed Szymon Holownia, a former TV host who ran as an independent, and left-wing candidates.

But to win, he must also pick up voters who supported far-right Confederation candidate Krzysztof Bosak two weeks ago, said Buras.

Although some will prefer Duda for his conservative values, others may now back Trzaskowski for reasons of free market radicalism, since they dislike the big-state spending of the PiS, or simply to prevent PiS from killing off their party as its chief competitor on the right, said Buras.

The fact that the second-round vote falls in the holiday season may benefit Duda, since the more affluent, urban voters who tend to back Trzaskowski are more likely to be away, said Nic.

But it's not yet clear how fears over the coronavirus -- or the fact that Poles already made the effort to vote in the first round -- will affect turnout, or how the debate over gay rights will galvanize voters.

""Trzaskowski stands for a more active Polish presence in the EU, more pro-European, more ambitious for climate policy and energy transformation,"" said Buras. ""But in the end he bets on those voters who feel fed up with the PiS.""",2020-07-11,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/11/europe/poland-presidential-election-vote-europe-intl/index.html
Tamara Hardingham-Gill,UK eases quarantine rules for travelers,"(CNN) — The UK government has relaxed quarantine rules for travelers from a number of destinations, including France, Italy, Belgium, Germany and Spain.

From July 10, visitors arriving in England from 58 selected countries will no longer be required to self-isolate for 14 days.

The US, China and Portugal are among the destinations that have been left off the list, which is to be kept ""under constant review.""

While it's been confirmed this will also apply to those visiting Wales and Northern Ireland, Scotland has issued a separate, smaller list made up of 39 countries, with Spain notably absent.

""Whether you are a holidaymaker ready to travel abroad or a business eager to open your doors again, this is good news for British people and great news for British businesses,"" Grant Shapps, UK secretary of state for transport, said in a statement last week.

""The entire nation has worked tirelessly to get to this stage, therefore safety must remain our watch word and we will not hesitate to move quickly to protect ourselves if infection rates rise in countries we are reconnecting with.""

The UK's mandatory two-week quarantine, which came into effect on June 8, has been criticized by many in the travel sector who feel it's slowed down the industry's recovery process in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Paul Charles, a member of Quash Quarantine, a campaign group lobbying the government to drop the measure, previously described the guidelines as ""unworkable and unenforceable.""

""A lot of jobs have gone in the last few weeks as people haven't been able to book holidays because they've been fearful of quarantine,"" he told CNN Travel.

""So, quarantine itself has acted as a block to future bookings.""

While travelers from the named countries won't have to self-isolate, they'll still need to provide the address of where they'll be staying for the duration of their trip.

According to the UK Department for Transport, the approved destinations pose ""a reduced risk to the public health of UK citizens.""

Faith Karimi,"As coronavirus cases skyrocket, US marks July Fourth with pleas for people to skip the parties","(CNN) After a week of skyrocketing coronavirus cases in the United States, officials are issuing a stark warning this July Fourth: Skip the parties.

If you really have to go, wear a mask, wash your hands and maintain social distancing. And if you must host, try to keep festivities outdoors and save the partygoers' information for future contact tracing if needed.

Coronavirus cases have been rising in 36 states with California, Arizona, Texas and Florida all posting record numbers of new infections this week.

The Florida Department of Health reported 11,445 new cases of Covid-19 on Saturday -- yet another record for new coronavirus cases reported in a single day. The previous record was set on Thursday, with 10,109 cases.

Nationwide, the virus has killed more than 129,000 people and infected over 2.8 million since the pandemic started, according to Johns Hopkins University. And for the third straight day Friday, the number of new cases surpassed 50,000 nationwide.

Despite the bleak milestones, President Donald Trump said Saturday that 99% of coronavirus cases ""are totally harmless"" and the rising number of cases are caused by increased testing.

""Now we have tested, almost 40 million people. By so doing, we show cases -- 99% of which are totally harmless — results that no other country can show because no other country has testing that we have. Not in terms of the numbers, or in terms of the quality,"" Trump said during remarks on the White House South Lawn.

Of the 36 states whose new cases have gone up this week compared to the previous one, nine of them have increased by over 50%. They are Montana, Idaho, Nevada, Florida, Georgia, Tennessee, Louisiana, Alaska and Delaware.

People yearning for some normalcy hosted barbecues, found crowds in Virginia Beach, Virginia, and attended gatherings to watch fireworks. Meanwhile, others were finding beaches in Miami and Los Angeles closed, tubing in Texas rivers banned and some city celebrations happening mostly on livestreams.

Fireworks light up the sky on June 30 in New York City, part of July Fourth displays in locations around the city that are kept secret to minimize crowds gathering due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Without stringent safety measures, health experts fear the holiday weekend could bring a wave of new infections that could overwhelm hospitals. To avoid a public health disaster, they're imploring people to wear masks, skip bars and crowded places, and avoid mixing with people outside of their households.

""What we know is that our behavior is the most powerful tool we have right now against the virus,"" said Dr. Nadine Burke Harris, surgeon general of California. ""And we really need folks to, you know, step up. I know that folks are tired, but it's absolutely critically important.""

Some beaches open for revelers, others stay closed

Beaches in Huntington Beach, California, would typically be packed with beachgoers this weekend. Just two weeks ago on June 14, photos showed the beach packed with people, towels and umbrellas.

But on Saturday, beaches in the Los Angeles area are closed due to rising Covid-19 cases, and beaches were left empty with large stretches of untouched white sand.

A normally crowded beach in Huntington Beach, California, is empty on July 4, 2020.

Renee Van Arsdale, who was riding bikes with her husband near the beach, told CNN there would usually be a ""sea of people"" on the beach for July Fourth.

""But today it's mostly locals just enjoying the beauty of the beach instead of being on the beach,"" she said.

Her husband, Gary Van Arsdale, pointed out that the city of Huntington Beach had to cancel its annual July Fourth parade. Instead, the city put on a neighborhood tour with small-vehicle caravans that weaved through the streets with local dignitaries.

Revelers enjoy the beach at Coney Island in the Brooklyn borough of New York on Saturday, July 4, 2020.

Beaches were open elsewhere, like New York's Coney Island. There were also beachgoers at Clearwater Beach in Florida, though there were fewer than typical for the holiday weekend.

At Clearwater, some had gathered in groups, according to a CNN crew on the scene, despite signs on the beach that warned not to gather in groups of 10 or more. But many at the beach told CNN they were taking certain precautions like wearing masks and having hand sanitizer at the ready.

Local resident Connor Gourley — who believed he had the coronavirus earlier in the year and recovered — told CNN he wasn't ""necessarily concerned"" about being on the beach. He wasn't going to let concerns about the virus stop him from celebrating Independence Day, he said.

""It's not more about the partying, it's about celebrating America and our Independence Day,"" he said. ""So, no matter what we're going to be out here and we're going to be American and enjoy our freedom.""

Some officials have made small exceptions for July Fourth festivities, so long as people adhere to restrictions. In Harris County, Texas, Judge Lina Hidalgo issued a countywide order prohibiting outdoor gatherings of 10 or more except for a handful of activities, including fireworks.

The order, signed Friday, says fireworks displays and gatherings with more than 100 people are allowed only if people view the celebrations from inside a vehicle. The order will remain in effect through at least Wednesday, August 26. It also includes exceptions for gatherings of 10 or more people at religious services, youth camps, swimming pools and certain sporting events.

""I think this is the real challenge we have,"" Dr. Umair Shah, executive director of Harris County Public Health, told CNN Saturday. ""It's 4th of July now. All of us should be coming together as Americans to fight this pandemic. It is not just going to go away.""

Health care workers make plea to governor

In Georgia, where coronavirus cases are going up, about 1,400 health care workers signed a letter to Gov. Brian Kemp asking him to increase state restrictions to slow the spread of the coronavirus.

The letter dated Thursday urged the governor to close bars and nightclubs and prohibit indoor gatherings of more than 25 people, including at places of worship. It also recommends a statewide face covering requirement that allows mayors and county officials to institute requirements appropriate for their jurisdictions.

""During the past week we have seen a sharp spike in cases that cannot be accounted for by increased testing. We also are seeing a very troubling increase in hospitalizations that, if continuing, will overwhelm our healthcare infrastructure, not only in metro Atlanta but also in rural Georgia,"" the letter said.

Dr. Jesse Couk, the chair of infectious disease at Shepherd Center and a doctor at Piedmont Atlanta Hospital, told CNN he worked with other doctors and health care professionals to create the letter after he became frustrated with lack of action after a spike in cases.

Couk and other medical contacts worked together to create the letter and have other health care professionals sign it. He said he wanted to highlight the need for increased social distancing and further restrictions to slow the spread and was speaking as a member of the Infectious Disease Society of Georgia and not as a representative of Piedmont Atlanta.

More states make sweeping mask mandates

""We have the ability to keep businesses open and move our economy forward so that Texans can continue to earn a paycheck, but it requires each of us to do our part ... and that means wearing a face covering in public spaces,"" Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said.

Other governors have also issued statewide orders, including California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois and Michigan. And in Tennessee, Gov. Bill Lee signed an executive order granting mayors in 89 counties the authority to issue mask requirements. It allows local governments to issue the mandates if a surge requires more preventative measures.

""While our densely populated urban areas continue to have the highest Covid-19 case rates, our local governments expressed a need for greater flexibility in addressing a rise in cases and that includes setting stronger expectations around masks,"" Lee said in a statement. ""This targeted approach ensures we protect both lives and livelihoods and safely keep our economy open in Tennessee.""

In Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, the beaches will be open to thousands of visitors for the holiday weekend — but with a mask requirement to help stop the spread, Mayor Brenda Bethune said.

US commercial labs report testing delays

Rising demand for Covid-19 testing has led some major commercial laboratories to report delays in turning around test results.

Testing demands have reached ""unprecedented levels,"" commercial laboratory Quest Diagnostics said this week, leading to delays in notifying clients of their results.

Although Quest can provide results within a day for priority patients — including sick health care workers and people in the hospital — the average turnaround time is three to five days for most other patients, the company said in a statement Monday.

While the number of tests conducted across the US is increasing, experts say long turnaround times can make it difficult to isolate confirmed cases and quickly quarantine their close contacts.

Another commercial laboratory, LabCorp, is reporting delays. The company told CNN in a statement Saturday that reporting test results may take one to two days longer now, leading to a current turnaround time of two to four days on average.

""In recent weeks, we have seen a steady increase in demand for molecular testing and we are doing everything we can to continue delivering results in a timely manner while continually increasing testing capacity,"" LabCorp said.",2020-07-04,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/04/health/us-coronavirus-saturday/index.html

Chandler Thornton,Facebook removes fake accounts tied to Brazil's Bolsonaro and sons,"(CNN) Facebook has removed dozens of what it said are fake social media accounts linked to the offices of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and his sons. The accounts were used to target journalists and political opponents of the president, and also discussed the coronavirus.

In a statement Wednesday , Facebook's Head of Security Policy Nathaniel Gleicher said the company took down ""35 Facebook accounts, 14 Pages, 1 Group and 38 Instagram accounts that were involved in coordinated inauthentic behavior in Brazil.""

Gleicher wrote the people behind the accounts ""attempted to conceal their identities,"" but were discovered to be ""associated with the Social Liberal Party and some of the employees of the offices of Anderson Moraes, Alana Passos, Eduardo Bolsonaro , Flavio Bolsonaro and Jair Bolsonaro.""

The accounts reportedly posted about ""domestic politics and elections."" They also posted ""criticism of the political opposition, media organizations and journalists, and most recently they posted about the coronavirus pandemic,"" Facebook said, adding that one or more of the social media pages had more than 883,000 followers.

The social network removed the accounts not for their content, but for ""inauthentic"" activity that aimed ""to evade enforcement, create fictitious personas posing as reporters, post content, and manage Pages masquerading as news outlets.""

President Bolsonaro has not commented on the Facebook action. However, when asked about the accounts, his eldest son Flavio Bolsonaro told CNN that ""as far as we know, they are all free and independent.""

He also questioned ""whether or not the platform [Facebook] exceeded the limits of censorship"" in removing the accounts. ""Judgments that do not allow for contradiction and wide defense are not compatible with our democracy, they are weapons that can destroy reputations and lives,"" he said.

Separately, Flavio Bolsonaro tweeted , ""My solidarity to all the profiles that were unfairly censored by Facebook and Instagram - apparently for supporting President Bolsonaro. As soon as you create your new profiles to exercise the sacred freedom of expression, let me know in private and I will help spread the word.""

Rodrigo Pedroso,Brazil coronavirus: Cases explode while country investigates corruption,"(CNN) As Brazil's coronavirus cases surge by the tens of thousands each day, the country is contending with a parallel outbreak -- a flurry of corruption investigations into the alleged misuse of public money rapidly shelled out for Covid-19 emergency procurement.

The investigations have reached all levels of government, including three state governors who have come under federal scrutiny in the past two months. Nearly 1,500 federal criminal judicial proceedings have also been opened into coronavirus-related cases, including investigations into misuse of federal funds, fraud, overpricing, and money laundering, according to a summary the federal prosecution office shared with CNN. The data provided to CNN does not specify what portion of the probes relate to corruption.

Meanwhile, cases of coronavirus are soaring across Brazil , and the healthcare system in several states has been stretched to its limit. Brazil is second only to the United States in the number of infections and deaths, and on Tuesday, bombastic president Jair Bolsonaro was also diagnosed with Covid-19.

State-level investigations

On the state level, investigations into Covid-19 emergency purchases have been reported in at least 11 of Brazil's 26 states and the federal district, according to the Federal Police. At least seven high-ranking state health officials have been fired or resigned during the pandemic.

Two health officials in Rio de Janeiro were arrested in a probe known as ""Operation Merchants of Chaos,"" into an alleged scheme to pilfer millions of dollars from a contract for ventilators that federal authorities say were never delivered.

In São Paulo, Brazil's most populous state and the epicenter of the country's coronavirus outbreak, a large purchase of imported ventilators is under investigation.

State prosecutors and an accountability court are reviewing a $100 million contract signed by the state government at the beginning of the pandemic for some 3,000 ventilators from China. Sao Paulo officials paid as much as $40,000 each for some ventilators, while the cheapest were bought for $20,000, according to the Brazilian Office of the Comptroller General, which notes that the average price per ventilator paid across Brazil is around $16,000.

The state government has said the purchases complied with legal requirements. But in June, the state canceled the contract after receiving only a small number of the ventilators. Attorneys for the São Paulo state government have filed a lawsuit against the middleman company seeking a refund and fines for the unfulfilled delivery. It was a highly publicized debacle for São Paulo's government, which is listed in the middle of a ranking published by Transparency International Brazil of states' transparency in Covid-19 emergency contracting.

Globally, the rush to obtain urgent medical supplies has led to hastily negotiated contracts and sometimes exorbitant prices. Spiking demand for medical equipment has also forced legitimate costs up as suppliers ramp up production and compete for raw materials.

Expeditious emergency contracting is useful in order to meet the need of the pandemic, acknowledges Guilherme France, research coordinator for Transparency International Brazil -- however, doing so ""also implies a loosening of controls that exist precisely in order to prevent corruption.""

He says that the frenzied circumstances of the pandemic have opened the door to abuses. ""In this moment of inflated prices and limited offer, opportunistic businesses arise to take advantage of these vulnerabilities and to increase profits in an unscrupulous way,"" he said.

Federal investigations across the country

On the federal level, probes into suspected misuse of federal funds have touched officials across the country, from a mayor and city officials in the remote northern Amapá to the governors of the Amazonian states of Pará and Amazonas and down to the southeastern beaches of Rio de Janeiro.

Federal agents searched the home of Amazonas Gov. Wilson Lima in late June as part of an investigation into an alleged no-bid contract for the purchase of ventilators by the state government from a wine importer in the capital Manaus. Lima has denied any wrongdoing. ""I am absolutely calm and am certain that these facts will soon be clarified,"" he said

In the state of Pará, federal agents searched the home of Gov. Helder Barbalho, who is suspected of involvement in a ventilator contract that delivered equipment with glaring technical defects, such as the lack of an internal battery which means it could shut off if power went out, flaws in the breathing cycle that could cause lung damage and problems with the machine's ability to be cleaned and sterilized.

Federal prosecutors allege that Barbalho was aware of the flaws in the equipment and had a close relationship with a businessman who brokered the sale. But the governor has denied any wrongdoing. ""I clarify that I am not a friend of the businessman [involved in the sale] and, obviously, I did not know that the ventilators would not work,"" Barbalho wrote on Twitter in early June.

In Rio de Janeiro, Gov. Wilson Witzel had his cell phones and computers seized by federal agents who entered his official residence on May 26 as part of a probe investigators dubbed ""Operation Placebo"" into alleged embezzlement of public health funds. Rio state lawmakers, responding to the federal investigation, have now launched an impeachment investigation of Witzel over Covid-19 procurement, including allegations of graft in a purchase of ventilators and a contract to build f ield hospitals. Witzel has denied any wrongdoing.

The investigations into the three governors are ongoing and no charges have been made against them.

However, the probes have already deprived Witzel's government of the high-ranking health officials who would have otherwise led Rio de Janeiro through its pandemic response. Fernando Ferry, Rio de Janeiro's health secretary for a matter of weeks, resigned his post in late June after three other top state health officials had lost or quit their jobs amid wrongdoing and corruption accusations during the pandemic. His resignation came a week after federal agents indicted 17 people in Rio de Janeiro, including a former state lawmaker, for alleged involvement in a scheme to misappropriate funds meant to be spent on medical equipment.

Ferry later testified to lawmakers on an oversight committee probing public health expenditures during the pandemic that he feared ""dirtying"" his personal record. He told Brazil's TV Record: ""In order to make the machine work, I would have to sign off on things without being covered by a contract. And this legal imbroglio would spill over to my CPF,"" a reference to a Brazilian identification number that tracks one's creditworthiness.

'You could have saved more lives and helped more people if resources were not diverted'

President Bolsonaro rose to power promising to clean up corruption and to change ""all that is there, "" as he frequently said on the campaign trail. But France, from Transparency International, says that Bolsonaro's performance before and during the pandemic is hardly fulfilling the anti-corruption rhetoric that drew voters.

""Now, after a year and a half of governing, the Bolsonaro administration is responsible for a series of setbacks in the fight against corruption,"" France said. Those setbacks include instances of blatant political interference in institutions responsible for fighting corruption, such as the Federal Police, the Federal Prosecution Office, and the Council for Financial Activities Control.

In April, Bolsonaro replaced Justice Minister Sergio Moro with an ally, André Mendonça, who in turn named a new head of the Federal Police. This comes as two of Bolsonaros sons are under investigation for alleged wrongdoing unrelated to the pandemic.

Christian Lynch, political scientist and professor at Rio de Janeiro State University, says local corruption scandals and investigations could prove beneficial to Bolsonaro politically, as he outsources the responsibility of handling the pandemic.

""The scandals that appeared in Rio de Janeiro and Pará, states whose governors were the opposition, were very useful because they associated the independence of their opponents from the federal government with corruption,"" he said.

The country's flurry of corruption investigations come amid crushing poverty and unemployment in the country, as the pandemic caps off years of economic decline . According to a new projection from the International Monetary Fund, Brazilian GDP is expected to shrink 9.1% this year.

For Micaella Melo de Paula, a respiratory physiotherapist in a Rio de Janeiro public hospital who intubates Covid-19 patients, the allegations of misused funds and backroom deals are an indignity. Employees at the hospital where she works went unpaid for more than a month during the pandemic, the Rio de Janeiro state health secretariat has confirmed to CNN. A probe is now underway in order to settle payments. Melo de Paula herself says she is owed more than a thousand dollars in unpaid wages from work during the pandemic.

""But it gives you a feeling of impotence and anger to know that you could have saved more lives and helped more people if resources were not diverted, if supplies were not overpriced,"" she said.

""The pandemic comes to expose all these dirty politics and its schemes -- and we are the ones who are the frontline suffering from their actions.""",2020-07-08,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/08/americas/brazil-coronavirus-corruption-intl/index.html
Analysis Cnn'S Matt Rivers,Why Trump? Why now? Behind Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador's big trip to the US,"Mexico City (CNN) If you're not a close follower of US-Mexico relations, you might be forgiven for assuming President Donald Trump and Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador wouldn't get along.

The two share a famously contentious border. Demonizing people on the Mexican side of it has long been a key part of the Trump political playbook, while López Obrador -- known as AMLO in Mexico -- has accused Trump of inciting racism. But when the two men meet this week to celebrate the implementation of the United States-Mexico-Capnada Agreement (USMCA) trade deal , expect smiles all around.

This is the first time Mexico's President has left the country since taking office in December of 2018. The fact that he's headed to the White House speaks volumes, both practically and symbolically. Both leaders are looking for victories beyond their losing battles with the coronavirus pandemic.

Trump said last month that López Obrador was ""a really great guy,"" and López Obrador said he was going to Washington, DC, ""to thank Trump for his support and solidarity."" They still have plenty to disagree over, but there also seems to be a lot of common ground -- not the least of which could be their similar governing styles as two populists who've built political brands on a cult of personality.

Showing off the USMCA

Their meeting centers on the USMCA, a deal that passed after months of difficult negotiations.

The timing of the meeting amid the rampant spread of the coronavirus in both countries has questioned by critics. But for two men who've seen their approval ratings consistently drop during the outbreak, the meeting presents an opportunity to talk about something else.

""Right now, neither is getting high marks for their handling of the health crisis, making the visit a welcome distraction,"" said Christopher Wilson, deputy director of the Wilson Center's Mexico Institute.

The USMCA's implementation represents one of the biggest foreign policy wins of the Trump administration — and arguably one of the only major examples of the President creating new, lasting agreements with foreign countries rather than tearing up existing ones.

Trump will promote this deal as a win and a follow-through on a 2016 campaign promise to rework previous free trade deals, even as Democrats say the only reason they voted to pass the USMCA is because they overhauled the original framework during negotiations.

""López Obrador's visit will allow [Trump] to showcase how he has bent Mexico to his will by reminding voters that this is a 'very good deal' for the US while signaling his achievements at strong-arming Mexico on immigration policies,"" said Gladys McCormick, an expert on US-Mexico affairs at Syracuse University.

Meanwhile, López Obrador has also staked a lot of political capital in the USMCA and likely wants to make sure the Trump administration is invested in ironing out any issues that arise during its implementation.

Mexico's economy was sputtering even before the pandemic hit. Now, with the IMF predicting a 10.5% GDP contraction in 2020 and his party facing critical midterm elections next summer, shoring up Mexico's most important economic relationship is probably top of mind for López Obrador.

""Almost 85%of all [Mexican] exports go to the [United States], which is obviously a huge number,"" said Larry Rubin, president of the American Society of Mexico. ""Mexico is highly dependent on trade with the United States.""

""Mexico will benefit more by sending very clear and positive messages that if investors want to come and invest in Mexico, their investment will be protected,"" Rubin said.

A calculated strategy for AMLO

Critics of the Mexican President have urged him not to travel to the White House, saying it follows a trend of AMLO wilting in the face of Trump's economic bullying and racist rhetoric.

Consider that in 2019, when Trump expressed anger over the flow of Central American migrants traveling to the US border through Mexico, he threatened tariffs on Mexican imports if Mexico didn't crack down.

López Obrador quickly complied. He deployed Mexico's National Guard, a newly created force supposedly dedicated to fighting Mexico's horrific levels of violence, to the northern and southern borders, significantly slowing migrant flows.

Critics have said that while Trump's vaunted border wall hasn't actually been built or paid for by Mexico as Trump promised, AMLO's National Guard deployment essentially did just that.

AMLO also signed onto the so-called Remain in Mexico policy, under which the Trump administration forces asylum seekers to wait in Mexico while their paperwork is processed, exposing them to dangerous conditions in Mexican border cities where levels of violence are sky high.

AMLO has also largely refrained from criticizing the provocative language sometimes used by Trump and his supporters when describing people crossing from Mexico into the United States.

""How do you stop these people?"" Trump asked of immigrants at a May 2019 rally in Florida. When an audience member shouted, ""Shoot them!"" Trump smiled and said, ""Only in the [Florida] Panhandle can you get away with a statement like that."" The exchange continues to be referenced in Mexican political commentary today.

AMLO agreed to step up his country's immigration enforcement just a few weeks later.

""We Mexican democrats will not forget Mr. López Obrador's reverence to the man who has maligned us,"" wrote Mexican historian Enrique Krauze this week in a New York Times op-ed.

But López Obrador's approach to the United States is a calculated one. Next to nothing should get in the way of Mexico capitalizing on its relationship with the world's largest economic power. Some might call it appeasement. Others call it smart.

""If we have a good relationship with the US, we will avoid bad treatments, and we've accomplished this,"" he said in his daily press conference on Monday. ""My critics say, 'How am I going to the US if they have offended the Mexicans?'I want to tell the people of my country that since we took office, there's been a respectful relationship, not only to the Mexican government but also to the Mexicans.""

""Notwithstanding some of President Trump's derogatory remarks about Mexico and Mexicans, President López Obrador is placing Mexican national interest first and conducting himself like a statesman,"" said Armand Peschard-Sverdrup, a senior associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

Whatever the strategy, it has led to the US President taking a kind view of López Obrador, with Trump even tweeting in June of 2019, ""Mexico is doing a far better job than the Democrats on the border. Thank you Mexico!""

Two sides of the same coin?

And although the two presidents come from very different political backgrounds — Trump the right-wing former television star, AMLO the decades-long politician, self-declared leftist and former mayor of Mexico City — experts note they have very similar approaches to governing.

""Both presidents are populists and economic nationalists,"" said Wilson. ""Both came to power on a message of empowering the disenchanted and disaffected. Both see institutions and bureaucracy as unnecessary checks on their power and obstacles in their direct relationship with voters.""

And the presidents have taken a remarkably similar track in their handling of the coronavirus pandemic.

Both presidents downplayed the initial threat. Trump promised back in February it would just disappear while AMLO famously held up two amulets and said, while smiling, that they would ""protect"" him from the virus.

They also routinely ignore public health experts' advice to socially distance and wear masks in public, and neither man is in favor of mass testing.

Most crucially, Trump and AMLO are both aggressively pushing for their economies to reopen. So perhaps it's no surprise that, of all the reasons to meet, they would find time this week to tout a new economic deal.",2020-07-07,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/07/americas/mexico-us-andres-manuel-lopez-obrador-analysis-intl/index.html
Bill Weir,Gravedigger takes Covid-19 more seriously than Brazil's President,"São Paulo, Brazil (CNN) Adenilson Costa has worked at the Vila Formosa graveyard for a quarter of a century and he says he has never seen the fresh graves fill up so fast.

It's the largest cemetery in Latin America, but since coronavirus came to Brazil , it isn't big enough.

Gravedigger Adenilson Costa says he is shocked and saddened by what he sees at work every day.

Families are hustled through funerals, Costa said, each given no more than 10 or 15 minutes to say goodbye so the cemetery can manage up to 80 burials a day at this site on the outskirts of São Paulo.

""That makes us very shocked, very sad, because it is the last greeting they will give to the loved one that they lost and they do not have time,"" Costa said.

There are so many burials at Vila Formasa these days, that families are restricted to just a few minutes to say their final goodbyes.

He spoke on a momentous day for Brazil -- a day when the Health Ministry announced more than 45,000 new cases of Covid-19 in the country, one of them the President, Jair Bolsonaro

Bolsonaro has spent months downplaying the spread of the lethal virus, even as Brazil became the country with the second-most cases -- and deaths -- behind only the United States.

And while gravedigger Costa is shocked by the rate of death, Bolsonaro told many of his citizens they had nothing to worry about, as he announced he himself had the virus.

Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro wore a mask when he told reporters about his coronavirus diagnosis.

""Younger people: take care, but if you are affected by the virus, rest assured that, for you, the possibility of something more serious is close to zero,"" the President said.

Bolsonaro acknowledged the risk was higher for those, like himself, over the age of 65. But he told reporters he felt fine, and gave much of the credit to hydroxychloroquine, the malaria drug first pushed controversially by US President Donald Trump then stockpiled by Bolsonaro but unproven as a treatment for Covid-19

Bolsonaro told CNN Brasil that he took both hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin while he awaited the result of his fourth Covid-19 test in four months.

""I am feeling very well. I believe that the way they administered the hydroxychloroquine on, the effect was immediate,"" he said.

Bolsonaro's touting of hydroxychloroquine worries Dr. Luiz Henrique Mandetta, Brazil's former health minister.

Former health minister Luiz Henrique Mandetta, at right in this photo from March, disagreed with President Jair Bolsonaro, left, over how to tackle the coronavirus pandemic.

""So he pretends that this medicine would save 90% of people's lives. It is not the medicine. It's just the way the disease goes,"" Mandetta said.

""The problem is that people are going to believe that,"" he added. ""His message could be a disaster in a country that has so many people that really listen more to messages than read about things.""

Mandetta said he and other ministers tried to warn Bolsonaro to take the pandemic seriously and make a national plan to tackle it. But they were not heeded.

""He [Bolsonaro] always said that he would, he was more worried about the damage in the economy than damage to people's lives,"" Mandetta said.

A backhoe has been brought in to dig more graves at the Vila Formosa cemetery in São Paulo.

Mandetta says he hopes the President gets well but also hopes he thinks of all the other Brazilians who got a positive Covid test result on the same day as Bolsonaro.

""I just hope that he can think about the other people that have a diagnostic on the same day as he did,"" he said. ""The people that received the test today are going home, not to the place where he lives with a personal physician 24 hours a day, ... plenty of people ... and all the equipment.""",2020-07-07,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/07/americas/brazil-coronavirus-bolsonaro-gravedigger-weir/index.html
Devan Cole,"New York Times: Trump considered selling Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria, former acting Homeland Security chief says","Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump considered the idea of selling Puerto Rico in 2017 after the island was devastated by Hurricane Maria, the former acting Homeland Security secretary told The New York Times in an interview published Friday.

""The President's initial ideas were more of as a businessman, you know,"" Elaine Duke, who was serving as DHS' acting secretary when the hurricane hit the island in September 2017, told the Times.

""'Can we outsource the electricity? Can we can we sell the island? You know, or divest of that asset?'"" Trump reportedly said, according to Duke in the newspaper interview. ""(She said the idea of selling Puerto Rico was never seriously considered or discussed after Mr. Trump raised it.),"" the paper reported.

Trump has previously taken aim at Puerto Rican officials for their management of the billions in relief funds his administration has appropriated for storm recovery, accusing the island's leaders of spending some of that money for reasons other than hurricane clean-up. In November 2018, White House officials told congressional leaders and appropriators that the President did not want any additional relief funding sent to the island.

Christina Maxouris,US coronavirus: Florida sets new single-day record for new Covid-19 cases of any state nationwide,"(CNN) The Florida Department of Health reported 15,299 new Covid-19 cases Sunday, the highest number of new cases reported in a single day by any state since the coronavirus pandemic began.

The previous record -- also set by Florida -- came on July 4, with 11,434 new cases reported, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

The test positivity rate in Florida is 19.60%, according to JHU statistics.

With coronavirus cases climbing across the US, local and state leaders have found themselves at odds over the types of restrictions that should be in place to move forward effectively.

In Florida, Rep. Donna Shalala said the virus is still out of control and places like Miami are edging closer to shutting down for a second time.

""It's out of control across the state because our governor won't even tell everybody to wear masks. At least in Miami-Dade county, everyone must wear a mask when they're outside,"" she told CNN Saturday night.

""This is an American tragedy,"" she added.

In the past weeks, the state broke multiple records of single-day highs in new cases and reported another 10,360 new infections Saturday. Around 40 hospitals across the state have no ICU beds available and more than 7,000 patients are hospitalized statewide with the virus, state data showed Saturday.

But Gov. Ron DeSantis has resisted implementing a state-wide mask mandate, saying last week the state has ""stabilized where we're at."" On Saturday, he suggested Florida would not be moving on to the next reopening phase for now, saying ""we want to get this positivity rate down.""

In Georgia, Gov. Brian Kemp slammed the Atlanta mayor's decision to move the city's reopening back to phase 1 , saying the action was ""merely guidance -- both non-binding and legally unenforceable."" Phase 1 includes an order for residents to stay home except for essential trips. The mayor, who has tested positive for Covid-19, defended her decision saying the state opened recklessly and residents were ""suffering the consequences.""

""As clearly stated in my executive orders, no local action can be more or less restrictive, and that rule applies statewide,"" Kemp wrote on Twitter.

The debates are part of nationwide efforts by US leaders to control a now rapid spread of coronavirus without having to force residents into a second lockdown. More than half of US states have paused or rolled back their reopening plans in hopes of slowing down new cases. But both mandates and suggestions for face masks by officials still face heavy backlash by many Americans -- even as experts warn they're the most effective way to prevent further spread of the virus.

Now deep into the coronavirus crisis, the US is reporting more than 3.2 million infections, according to Johns Hopkins University. That's more than the individual population of 21 states, Washington DC and Puerto Rico, according to US Census Bureau data. At least 134,814 Americans have died.

How states are trending

According to data from Johns Hopkins University, at least 33 states are recording an upward trend in new cases, compared to the previous week.

Those states are: Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia and Wisconsin.

Fourteen states are trekking steady: Alaska, Arizona, Maryland, Mississippi, Nevada, New Hampshire, Oregon, New York, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Washington state and Wyoming.

Three states are reporting a decline: Delaware, Maine and New Jersey

Americans hit the road on 4th of July

Even as cases surge in many parts of the country, a new analysis of cell phone data across 10 coronavirus hotspots suggests even more people hit the road over the July 4 holiday than during the Memorial Day weekend.

Mobility is one of the drivers of transmission of the virus, experts have said, but it could be weeks before there is -- if there is -- an increase in cases linked to the July holiday.

The analysis comes from data shared with CNN by Cuebiq, one of the private companies the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention uses to track general movement in the US. It included data from Houston, Austin, Dallas, San Antonio, Phoenix, Orlando, Tampa, Charleston, Miami and Atlanta areas.

Travelers tended to visit cities in their own state or region, but some traveled further. About 3.7% of visitors to the Miami area came from New York, and nearly 4% came from the Atlanta area. Of the people who visited Phoenix, 16.3% came from just three metro areas in Southern California -- including Los Angeles, Riverside and San Diego. Others came from areas around Chicago and Dallas.

The travels come despite guidance from health officials who urged Americans to skip traditional celebrations, adding residents who may be feeling well could also be carrying the virus.

The CDC now estimates 40% of people infected with coronavirus show no symptoms. The percent of asymptomatic cases in the country remains uncertain, the agency said.

The fiery debate around school openings

As the country grapples to get ahold of the crisis, the president announced last week he's pressuring governors to reopen schools in a push to return the country to business as usual.

But internal documents from the CDC warned fully reopening K-12 schools and universities would pose the ""highest risk"" for spread of the virus, according to a report by The New York Times.

The 69-page document obtained by the Times marked ""For Internal Use Only"" was among materials for federal public health response teams deployed to coronavirus hotspots to help local public health officials handle the outbreak, the newspaper reported.",2020-07-12,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/12/health/us-coronavirus-sunday/index.html

Kristen Rogers,Johns Hopkins' dashboard: The people behind the pandemic's most visited site,"(CNN) If the year 2020 is good for anything, it's the lesson that during a crisis, anyone who builds a better mousetrap will find the world beating a path to his door.

A humble team at Johns Hopkins University in Maryland reminded the world of late poet Ralph Waldo Emerson's phrase when they created a real time tracking map of coronavirus cases and deaths.

And the world came to their door. They report that the site, plus downloads of its data, hosts three to five billion interactions daily. By their measurement, interactions include uses of the public dashboard and requests from a separate website for the underlying data used by news outlets and others who design their own maps and graphics.

Government agencies, public health departments, the public and news outlets, including CNN , regularly rely onit for the latest updates on the confirmed cases, deaths and recoveries connected to this harrowing disease.

""We were collecting data on a new virus that nobody understood at a time [when] there was not a single web page dedicated to Covid-19 case count,"" said Lauren Gardner, the project's chief and an associate professor in, and codirector of, the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins Whiting School of Engineering.

Professor Lauren Gardner has experience modeling infectious diseases.

From December 2019 to January 2020, Ensheng Dong, Gardner's first-year PhD student, heard from family in China who regularly reported how the outbreak was worsening and upending their lives. After passing an exam that cleared him to earn his PhD, tracking confirmed cases in China was what he wanted to tackle next.

First-year PhD student Ensheng Dong helped create the dashboard in less than a day.

On January 21, over coffee during a weekly research meeting, Dong proposed this idea to Gardner.

His background in spatial data visualization and Gardner's past in modeling infectious diseases converged to create the first iteration of the dashboard — which they finished that night and published the next day. The map's alarming red dots then reflected only 320 reported cases — mostly in China, the rest in Thailand, Japan and South Korea.

We are tracking the 2019-nCoV spread in real-time. Cases and locations can be viewed here; data available for download. #nCoV2019 @JHUSystems https://t.co/qfVymyUf7v pic.twitter.com/SS9zUwrQxT — Lauren Gardner (@TexasDownUnder) January 22, 2020

""He's gotten to play some pretty major roles in some really central problems to the society for someone that's six months into a degree program,"" Gardner said. ""I keep telling him that he needs to not get used to this and it's not normal. And [that] the rest of his PhD experience is going to be really boring, but I don't think he believes me.""

For two weeks from dawn till dusk, Dong lived and breathed the dashboard; it took precedence over his free time outside of class and soon the classes themselves. With Gardner's blessing, he pushed back a required course until the fall semester.

Has maintaining those responsibilities affected his health in any way? ""Not really,"" he said. ""I think this is what the research should do. The responsibility for this dashboard gives me energy.""

But as cases became globally widespread, they needed help.

""Initially, [I worried about my family]; right now, it's their time to worry about my situation in the US,"" Dong said.

Gardner and her team work to maintain the Covid-19 dashboard, built by her team at Johns Hopkins University.

What was once a modest goal to fill a research gap in a field with antiquated methods for disease tracking is now a tool widely used around the world.

They had no idea ""that it would evolve into something that literally impacts almost everybody's life on the planet,"" Gardner said.

From erratic data to the map on our screens

About 25 people from multiple disciplines now support the dashboard, including graduate students and senior software developers and research scientists primarily based in Maryland, California and England.

Like a lot of people, they're working from home. Their days begin with Zoom calls during which they hash out to-do lists and pressing issues. The conversation continues through a myriad of Slack channels, emails and phone calls.

""It's efficient, but it's boring,"" Gardner said. ""I really miss a bit of the real, in-person world.""

Gardner is in charge, so everyone involved reports to her. Her daily to-do list involves running a research group of PhD students, overseeing data additions and design for the dashboard and making strategic decisions for the development of the dashboard. She spends about half of her time on research based on data from the map.

From dozens of sources including local health departments and data aggregating websites, the dashboard reports cases from more than 3,500 locations — at the province level in China; at the county level in the US; and at subnational and national levels elsewhere.

Because they update the dashboard at least hourly, they've had to shift from manual data collection to leaning more on automatic culling — the team praised data wizards at the university's Applied Physics Laboratory for creating a code that periodically travels to trusted websites and scrapes for data. For independent research and the US government, the APL provides technological systems engineering, development and analysis.

The automated code aggregates the data and publishes it into GitHub , a software development platform. An anomaly detection system reviews every number that comes in and holds back anything that doesn't make sense, explained Ryan Lau, a graduate software engineer in the lab. Sometimes the web sources are technologically unreliable, but the case data is accurate in regard to what has been reported, Gardner said.

The teams manually validate and approve numbers before letting them be processed through a geographic information systems tool into the visualizations we see

Ryan Lau, a graduate software engineer in the university's Applied Physics Laboratory, plays a key role in collecting the data.

""Not to be cliche, but a picture is worth a thousand words,"" Lau said. The APL team works on building and maintaining the automated capabilities of the data-pulling code.

Frequent updates and data from multiple sources is what makes the dashboard different from the World Health Organization's tracker, which counts only states and nations, said Beth Blauer, executive director of the university's Centers for Civic Impact, which supports governments and nonprofits aiming to make data-driven change.

Blauer's work with the Centers for Civic Impact is her day job, but she also began working with the data in March after she used the map to assess the risk of traveling.

Beth Blauer helps run the US dashboard.

Her tasks include researching, reviewing and interviewing about US testing and county case data to provide additional insights for the university's Blaueris one of the technology and data gurus behind the US map, which is separate from and more detailed than the global map.

She's also a single mom. ""[My kids] deserve some kind of an award for the way that they've been able to stick with me through this,"" Blauer said.

The map places at people's fingertips ""information upon which they can make really important decisions,"" said Jennifer Nuzzo, who works on projects similar to Blauer's, but for the Coronavirus Resource Center. Nuzzo is an associate professor in the university's Bloomberg School of Public Health and a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.

Jennifer Nuzzo, an associate professor in the university's Bloomberg School of Public Health, also contributes to the US dashboard.

""For governments, it's about very high consequence decisions about protecting health and supporting the economy. And for people, it's about how to protect yourself and your loved ones.""

The challenges of informing the world

Work that relays ever-changing information from thousands of places comes with hurdles. There's no international modus operandi for how to count coronavirus infections and deaths.

The dashboard's infrastructure is more stable these days, but the ""sources and information coming in are still changing quite a bit,"" Gardner said.

Stumbling blocks have included when the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggested local health officials switch from reporting only confirmed cases and deaths to also probable cases and deaths

And sometimes the numbers between state and county health departments don't match up — they report differently or at varying times.

Each time these transitions happen, the team has to figure out how to handle them.

The biggest challenge is trying to collect data ""from multiple locations simultaneously and provide it in real time while all of those dynamics are at play,"" Gardner said. Knowing there are so many eyes on it and having to explain it is difficult, too, she added.

The dashboard hasn't been without controversy . The soundness of data aggregating website Worldometer is considered questionable by some academics, but the site is one of many sources from which the JHU dashboard pulls data.

Lessons on human behavior and how a virus travels

Besides the dashboard, the data also supports analyses for the university's Coronavirus Resource Center , which aims to help understanding of the virus and policymaking.

draws ""distinct connections"" between states' decisions in regard to closing and reopening phases and ""how the pandemic is unfolding at the local level,"" Blauer said. The US state policy timeline is an interactive graphic thatdraws ""distinct connections"" between states' decisions in regard to closing and reopening phases and ""how the pandemic is unfolding at the local level,"" Blauer said.

A county's health care capacity and access, demographics and disease data in comparison to its state are three factors starting to reveal those disparities.

Data on testing and contact tracing could illuminate long-term patterns regarding race, socioeconomic status and systemic barriers to testing access — an effort headed by Blauer and Nuzzo.

""There is nothing so stark than looking at the disproportionate amount of Black and Latino people that are [contracting and] dying from this disease, knowing there is no medical safety net for them and also understanding that there are deliberate decisions that aren't taking their best interests in mind,"" Blauer said.

""This is the piece that I think has been the most difficult for me.""

How they're coping during the pandemic

For a long time, Gardner felt removed from reality since busyness left no time for reflection on what was happening around her. Since the dashboard processes have stabilized, she's been able to focus more on the circumstances.

""I would say that I'm probably one of the more frustrated people with the situation, because I am just so well aware of the patterns, the trends, the direction we're going and mistakes we're making,"" she said. ""Watching that happen ... it's extra frustrating.""

Dong frets about his family in China, but the work gets into his subconscious as well. His pandemic-era dreams look like worrying over the quality of the data, which makes him incredibly anxious, he said.

Seeing the contextual reality of the data and thus being able to understand relative risks helps Nuzzo cope with what might otherwise be constant worry. But she also ""can't shut off the pandemic.""

""It's both my job and my life in a way that usually at the end of your workday, you get a break from what you're working on,"" she said. ""We don't escape it at all. That can be just emotionally exhausting.""

What the future holds

The need for this kind of data and analysis isn't going away any time soon, Nuzzo presumed.

""I've been focusing on [pandemic preparedness] for 20 years,"" she said. ""I unfortunately know that we live in an age of epidemics ... We are building an important process and infrastructure that I hope we never have to use again, but data tells me we very well may have to use that again.""

Considering how the dashboard will be used during and after the pandemic has been fruitful.

Philanthropic donations, including from Bloomberg Philanthropies and the Stavros Niarchos Foundation , have been the additional support needed to keep the research train chugging and flexible in regard to what the team can pursue.

""I believe there's a vision of the world in which if outbreaks of a new virus happen, we can also have the public health capabilities to stop the virus in its place, to prevent it from becoming a global pandemic,"" Nuzzo said. ""But as we're seeing now, we have more work to do in order to make that happen.""",2020-07-11,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/11/health/johns-hopkins-covid-19-map-team-wellness-trnd/index.html
Jay Croft,Florida publicly discloses hospitalizations as the US breaks another case record,"(CNN) Another record-setting day of Covid-19 cases across the US came with a spotlight on Florida, which publicly released its number of coronavirus patients currently in the hospital after weeks of pressure to do so.

A total of 6,991 people are hospitalized because of the virus, the state's Agency for Health Care Administration said Friday.

Friday brought 63,900 new Covid-19 cases nationwide, a single-day record, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The new high comes as many states set records in infection rates and hospitalizations

While 29 states saw an increase in new cases compared to last week, Miami-Dade County in Florida on Friday reported a staggering 28% positivity rate, or the percentage of people tested who test positive for the coronavirus.

Mayor Carlos Gimenez's office said the goal is to not exceed a positivity rate of 10%, but the county has exceeded the 18% mark for the past 14 days. On Thursday, it was 33.5%.

Over the past 13 days, hospitalizations in Miami-Dade County have gone up by 74%, the number of beds in intensive care units being used has increased by 88% and the use of ventilators has soared by 123%, according to the latest data from the county government.

""The situation is really concerning here in South Florida,"" Dr. David De La Zerda, the lead ICU physician at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami, told CNN on Friday. ""All the health care workers have a huge burden.""

But Gov. Ron DeSantis said there is no lack of ICU beds in the state

""You've got a lot of beds available,"" DeSantis said at a news conference in Orlando, adding that no major hospital system in the state ""has even gone to like a surge level.""

President Donald Trump traveled to the county on Friday on unrelated business. He was met by five local leaders, including a state senator and Gimenez.

From Miami, Trump traveled to Doral, where he received a briefing at US Southern Command, the US military command that covers the Caribbean and Central and South America. Trump will then go to a church nearby for a roundtable discussion with Venezuelans. After that, Trump will attend a private fundraiser in Hillsboro Beach. He is not scheduled to participate in any events related to the pandemic.

Florida health officials reported 11,433 new Covid-19 cases and 93 deaths, according to data on the Florida Department of Health website.

It's the second time the state's single-day tally topped 11,000, according to CNN's count. The health department reported 11,458 cases on July 4.

California reported 149 coronavirus-related deaths on Thursday, the highest daily total for the state, and total cases topped 300,000 on Friday. California's positivity rate as a 14-day average is climbing and stands at 7.4% with people between the ages of 18-49 accounting for almost 60% of all cases.

After outbreaks and more than two dozen deaths in state prisons, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation announced that 8,000 prisoners will be released early by the end of August.

Texas reported 105 deaths on Thursday, also a 24-hour record for the state, and Gov. Greg Abbott does not anticipate next week will bring any relief.

""I think the numbers are going to look worse as we go into next week, and we need to make sure that there's going to be plenty of hospital beds available in the Houston area,"" Abbott said in an interview with KRIV-TV.

Also setting daily records for new Covid-19 cases were Utah with 850, Louisiana with 2,642 and Georgia with 4,484, health officials said.

Georgia is reactivating a makeshift hospital at the Georgia World Congress Center, a large convention center in downtown Atlanta, amid a rising trend in cases, the governor's office said.

Michigan governor requires face coverings

Following an increase in cases in Michigan, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer signed an executive order requiring a face covering be worn in indoor public spaces. The order requires businesses to refuse service or entry to anyone not wearing a covering, the governor announced in a release.

Violating the order, which goes into effect Monday, could bring a $500 penalty.

There are exceptions, including while people are eating and drinking at a restaurant.

North Carolina set a record Thursday for the highest number of hospitalizations and posted the second highest number of cases for the state, said Gov. Roy Cooper.

""Though North Carolina isn't a surging hot spot like some other states, we could be if we don't stay strong in our fight,"" he said.

Staggering US numbers show pandemic isn't over

According to Johns Hopkins, there are at least 3.18 million cases of coronavirus in the US, and at least 134,059 people have died.

The nation's leading infectious disease expert warned Americans throughout the week that the nation is still ""knee deep"" in the first wave.

""We've never really gotten out of it,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci said in an interview with SiriusXM Doctor Radio airing on Friday. Fauci is the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

Dr. Peter Hotez says he's so alarmed by the rising numbers that he has a hard time sleeping.

""One (reason) is this steep acceleration,"" Hotez, dean of tropical medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, told CNN on Friday morning. ""We're approaching (Fauci's) apocalyptic prediction of 100,000 cases a day.""

Experts say US can stay open -- strategically

While it's impossible to maintain stringent coronavirus restrictions and return to a sense of normalcy, there is a middle ground, Fauci said.

""Rather than think in terms of reverting back down to a complete shutdown, I would think we need to get the states pausing in their opening process. Looking at what did not work well and try to mitigate that,"" Fauci told The Hill's Editor-at-Large Steve Clemons.

The all-or-nothing approach to socialization, and in Florida's case reopening too fast, contributed to the return of the virus, Fauci said on Podcast-19, FiveThirtyEight's weekly podcast on Covid-19.

""There are some governors and mayors that did it perfectly correctly,"" he said. ""But what happened is that many of the citizenry, said, 'You know, well, I'm either going to be locked down or I'm going to let it all rip.'""

Fauci has stressed the risk in congregating, and he recommended Thursday that the nation reevaluate recommendations on when to reopen bars and indoor restaurants, saying they pose one of the ""real problems.""

Even with the restrictions currently in place, only half of Nevada's bars were found to be in compliance, said Gov. Steve Sisolak. As of 11:59 p.m. local time on Friday, bars in certain counties will revert to similar restrictions in Phase 1 of the state's reopening plan.",2020-07-10,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/10/health/us-coronavirus-friday/index.html
Marshall Cohen,"'Broken heart syndrome' has increased during the Covid-19 pandemic, small study suggests","(CNN) A study published Thursday found a significant increase in ""broken heart syndrome"" at two Ohio hospitals among some patients who don't have coronavirus, suggesting that the physical, social and economic stressors from the pandemic are taking a physical toll.

Stress-induced cardiomyopathy or Takotsubo syndrome -- which is often called ""broken heart syndrome"" -- occurs when the heart muscles weaken, leading to chest pain and shortness of breath. It presents like a heart attack, but is triggered by stressful events , not blockages in the bloodstream. It can be deadly in rare cases, but patients usually recover within days or weeks.

Researchers at the Cleveland Clinic studied patients at two hospitals with heart trouble who were treated this spring, and compared them to patients with similar issues over the past two years. Patients during the pandemic were two times likelier to have broken heart syndrome, according to the study, which was published in the medical journal JAMA Network Open

The study looked at 1,914 patients from five distinct two-month periods, including a sample of more than 250 patients hospitalized in March and April, during the early peak of the pandemic. The study concluded that the increase was likely connected to the ""psychological, social, and economic stress"" caused by the pandemic, which includes ""imposed quarantine, lack of social interaction, strict physical distancing rules, and its economic consequences in people's lives.""

""The pandemic has created a parallel environment which is not healthy,"" said Dr. Ankur Kalra, the cardiologist who led the study. ""Emotional distancing is not healthy. The economic impact is not healthy. We've seen that as an increase in non-coronavirus deaths, and our study says that stress cardiomyopathy has gone up because of the stress that the pandemic has created.""

Sandee Lamotte,"Can the AC filter in your home, office or local mall protect you from Covid-19?","(CNN) When New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced last week that malls in New York could not reopen until they installed high-efficiency particulate air filters capable of trapping the virus that causes Covid-19, Harvard environmental health researcher Joseph Gardner Allen was thrilled.

""I've been writing consistently since early February about how healthy buildings should be the first line of defense against the novel coronavirus,"" said Allen, who directs the Healthy Buildings program at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

""I'm really grateful that we have a leader in the country -- somewhere -- who was finally talking about healthy buildings, ventilation and filtration,"" Allen said. ""That hasn't happened before. It just hasn't happened.""

A push to action

Allen was one of 239 scientists who wrote an open letter to the World Health Organization, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other health agencies, asking for a change in their guidance to the public on how the novel coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2, can spread.

Current guidance only focuses on ""hand washing, maintaining social distancing, and droplet precautions,"" according to the letter, published Monday in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases

The health agencies are ignoring the tiny droplets of virus that sputter and spray from our mouths, become aerosolized and then float away into the air, the scientists said, as a likely means of transmission.

""They don't want to talk about airborne transmission because that is going to make people afraid,"" co-author Donald Milton, a professor of environmental health at the University of Maryland, told CNN in a prior interview

""The best vaccine against fear is knowledge and empowering people to take care of themselves,"" Milton said. ""Why wearing a mask is important is because it blocks the aerosols at their source, when it is easy to block them.""

Because the CDC and WHO ""have been so slow to acknowledge aerosol transmission is happening, buildings are not putting in appropriate control measures,"" said Allen, who has focused his career on "" sick buildings "" and how they affect worker performance and productivity.

""The prudent and pragmatic approach is to acknowledge that airborne transmission is happening and put in the controls. If we find out in five years, that airborne was 5% of transmission, then OK,"" Allen said. ""But what if it's 20% or 30% and we failed to acknowledge it? That's a problem.""

Indoor settings such as restaurants, nightclubs and places of worship where people may be shouting, talking or singing and spend long periods of time have been associated with outbreaks, the agency said on its website.

""In these outbreaks, aerosol transmission ... cannot be ruled out. More studies are urgently needed to investigate such instances and assess their significance for transmission of COVID-19.""

Still, ""current evidence suggests that transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurs primarily between people through direct, indirect, or close contact with infected people through infected secretions such as saliva and respiratory secretions, or through their respiratory droplets,"" WHO said.

Not a major transmission route

Currently the CDC says ""Covid-19 is thought to spread mainly through close contact from person-to-person,"" through ""respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks.""

""I subscribe to the CDC opinion that the vast majority of transmission occurs within 3 to 6 feet from the infected person. That's the highway where all the traffic is -- where the the vast majority of this virus is transmitted,"" said infectious disease expert Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville.

""Are there side streets where it can become an aerosol and spread into the air? Yes,"" Schaffner said, adding that isn't likely to create a significant transmission route. If future public health investigations find these ""aerosol transmission events are more common than currently thought,"" that could change priorities.

""But I don't think we need to change all the AC units in the US and around the world based on side street traffic,"" Schaffner added. ""We want to attack the high traffic route by the big three -- masks, social distancing and avoiding large groups. Then we'll get virus transmission down.""

A role for aerosols?

mid-March study found SARS-CoV-2 can survive in microscopic respiratory droplets about 2.5 microns in diameter and smaller, which can remain airborne and viable for up to three hours or more.

Marr, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Virginia Tech, rounded up research focusing on the role of smaller airborne particles in the spread of the novel coronavirus. In early May, Harvard's Allen and LinseyMarr, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Virginia Tech, published a paper thatrounded up research focusing on the role of smaller airborne particles in the spread of the novel coronavirus.

""It is impossible for someone to release 'large droplets' (>5 microns) without also releasing smaller ones. Thus, transmission that is purported to occur via the spray of large droplets from a cough could in fact be occurring through inhalation of much smaller droplets at close range,"" the paper said.

Marr, who made a groundbreaking discovery that flu virus could float in the air in microscopic droplets for an hour or more, likes to use cigarettes as a way to explain how viruses spread.

""The smaller microscopic ones that we call aerosols behave kind of like cigarette smoke. So they're going to be more concentrated closer to the smoker, the person who might be infected. As you get farther away, your exposure would be much less,"" Marr said.

Will masks protect against those microscopic floating droplets? Top-rated N95 and surgical-grade masks will, and scientists are scrambling to study and tweak the effectiveness of homemade masks

""For most cloth face masks, there is no inner filtration layer that traps harmful particles,"" said Sara Greenstein, president and CEO of Lydall, one of the companies who signed with the U.S. Department of Defense to produce filtration media for N95 masks.

""Although wearing a cloth face mask is better than nothing, it is no substitute for an N95 or surgical mask, which are precisely engineered, highly technical products,"" Greenstein said.

Even when medical-grade masks are widespread, ventilation systems with highly effective filters are another key way to filter droplets from the air, Allen said.

MERV ratings

In his edict to New York mall owners, Cuomo was talking about HEPA filters, which have the highest MERV ratings, between 17 and 20.

What's MERV? It stands for ""minimum efficiency reporting value,"" and it's how filters are rated in their ability to trap tiny particles. The MERV ratings go from one to 20: Filters with higher MERV ratings are more effective than filters with lower ratings.

At the highest end, HEPA filters are used by hospitals to create sterile rooms for surgeries and to control infectious diseases, and are able to remove 99.97% of dust, pollen, mold, bacteria and other airborne particles with a size as small as 0.3 microns. For comparison, Covid-19 is thought to be between 0.06 to 1.4 microns.

""Filters are rated at their worst performance, so 99.97% is the worst it will do,"" Allen said. ""And that's rated for a particle size of 0.3 microns, but smaller and larger it actually does better. So the point is that it's capturing nearly all particles.""

Unfortunately, most businesses and home owners may find it difficult to retrofit their existing system to accommodate a HEPA filter, or any filter higher than the rating recommended by the system's manufacturer.

Doing so can actually impair the system's performance: Smaller pores in HEPA air filters make it more difficult for it to push air. Using denser filters can affect the efficiency of the unit and strain the fan, while decreasing indoor air quality -- the opposite of what you desire.

""HEPA filtration is not always going to be feasible or practical,"" Allen said. ""But there are other filters that can do the job. What is recommended now by the standard setting body for HVAC is a MERV 13 filter.""

High-efficiency filters in the 13-to-16 MERV range are often used in hospitals, nursing homes, research labs and other places where filtration is important.

""If you're an owner of a home, building or mall, you want to have someone to assess your system and install the largest MERV number filter the system can reliably handle without dropping the volume of air that runs through it,"" advised Erin Bromage, an associate professor of biology at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth.

""In addition, virtually all modern air conditioning systems in commercial buildings have a process called makeup air where they bring in air from outside and condition it and bring it inside,"" said Bromage, a CNN contributor who wrote a blog post in early May -- "" The Risks -- Know Them -- Avoid Them ,"" that got over 13 million views in one week.

Building owners should be looking at increasing the amount of makeup air that is brought inside by opening dampers, Bromage suggested.

""It's worse in regards to energy, but the more outside air we bring in, the more dilution of the virus we have and then the safer you are,"" Bromage said, adding that it's important to also monitor humidity levels.""

""There's sort of a 'Goldilocks' zone for the coronavirus, between 40 and 60% humidity, where it doesn't survive for very long,"" Bromage said.

Below 40% humidity, he said, the infected droplets hang in the air longer, thus providing the opportunity to travel farther to infect people.

""Above 60%, the droplets lose moisture more slowly, and therefore are heavier and more vulnerable to gravity,"" Bromage said, ""which sounds like a great thing.""

""But it actually drops onto surfaces much faster and being wet actually keeps the virus alive and infectious for longer,"" he added.

What to do?

First, focus on following public health recommendations: Wear masks when you go outside, stay away from large crowds and 6 feet from anyone not in your ""quarantine bubble,"" wash your hands with soap frequently, keep your hands away from your face, and try to only go to outdoor locations with excellent air circulation and filtration.

If you have the resources, there are also personal HEPA air purifiers on the market, designed to clean a standard room of a home. Some even come with humidifiers that will measure the air and keep the room between 40% and 60%, while others incorporate UV light technology designed to kill stray particles.

Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.

""Properly balanced UV light will inactivate viruses and bacteria in the air, which just adds an extra layer to the protection coming from the air purifier,"" Bromage said.

Costs range from a few hundred to over a thousand dollars, but don't be fooled by the price tag: You're looking for a machine with a HEPA filter designed for the size of your room -- so measure carefully. Having too small of a machine in a large room won't clean the air -- while having a large system in a small room is a waste of money.

Finally, know that HEPA filters can be pricey and will need frequent attention to keep them in top performance.

Many point to the cost of filters and the expense of retrofitting buildings and say it may not be worth it. That's not always the case, Allen said.

""It's a total misnomer that healthy building strategies and higher ventilation rates and filtration are expensive strategies,"" Allen said. ""When people know and understand how it's transmitted, then they're empowered to make better decisions.

""And that includes right in your home: You'd have people over, open up those windows; you're in your car with somebody else, roll down the window, a few inches,"" Allen said.

""No one strategy alone is going to work. But if we layer enough of these on top of each other, we can significantly reduce risks.""",2020-07-07,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/07/health/covid-19-air-conditioning-ventilation-wellness-scn/index.html
Emma Reynolds,Localized lockdowns show that we're in the most complex phase of coronavirus yet,"(CNN) From English cities to the Spanish seaside and Australian housing estates, local lockdowns are cropping up all over the world as countries ease restrictions only to encounter new coronavirus outbreaks.

After months of closures, governments are eager to reopen schools and businesses to allow people to get on with their lives. But fresh clusters of infection have seen leaders forced to reimpose restrictions in some hotspots, even as rules are eased elsewhere in the same country.

Beijing re-entered a partial lockdown in mid-June after a new coronavirus outbreak linked to a food market in the Chinese capital, while at least 24 states in the US are pausing or rolling back their reopenings as cases accelerate, amid fears that earlier restrictions were relaxed too fast.

Spain's northwest region of Galicia ordered a five-day lockdown Sunday for 70,000 inhabitants of A Marina, Lugo Province (pictured), just a day after the region of Catalonia in the northeast ordered the confinement of 200,000 people.

The threshold for imposing new lockdowns as well as their size and scope varies dramatically between countries, from a single building in Italy, to several Rwandan villages, to a community of 200,000 in Spain 's northeast and a coastal area of 70,000 in its northwest, to the whole of Israel.

There are hopes this approach could minimize the economic damage resulting from large-scale shutdowns. In Portugal, for example, 19 boroughs on the outskirts of Lisbon have shut down, while the capital's downtown area has continued its reopening, along with the rest of the country.

Workplace links

The German city of Guetersloh was put back into lockdown after 1,331 workers at its Toennies meat processing factory tested positive for the virus. Germany had few infections elsewhere, and the outbreak caused a sharp rise in the nation's R-number, a value indicating how fast the virus is spreading, according to its center for disease control, the Robert Koch Institute.

Alexander Kekulé, a virology professor and Director of the Institute for Biosecurity Research in Germany, told CNN: ""The only strategy we can have is a stamping-out strategy. It's the same thing we do usually when we have new clusters of infections of any novel disease.""

He said such moves were the ""new normal,"" but needed to be combined with other measures, such as wearing masks and maintaining social distancing, as well as efficient systems to track and trace outbreaks before case numbers enter the hundreds.

Kekulé said this was about clusters, rather than a second wave

""We should get used to it,"" he added. ""In many places of the world people are really used to rules, for instance: Mosquito nets. And you can argue that the mosquito net is terrible and will change your whole life -- and it's like everybody argues against masks -- but when you have at the other side a deadly disease, and no real good idea how to survive until the vaccine will come, one day or never, then I think it's the best chance we have.""

Guetersloh's lockdown was lifted Monday when a court in the state of North Rhine-Westfalia ruled that the regulation was ""no longer compatible with the principle of proportionality and the principle of equal treatment.""

Residents reported facing prejudice from the rest of the country, with a T-shirt on sale reading, ""Keep a distance, I am from Guetersloh,"" and CNN affiliate n-tv reporting that people with Guetersloh license plates were worried about driving outside the district for fear of discrimination.

A soldier stands in front of a building where dozens of Covid-19 cases were registered among a community of farm workers, in Mondragone, in the southern Italian region of Campania.

In the Italian city of Mondragone, authorities sealed off a building that housed migrant seasonal workers as a ""red zone"" late last month after 49 people tested positive for Covid-19. The army was sent to monitor the hotspot and a group of workers living in the building broke the quarantine to protest.

The governor of the Campania region, Vincenzo De Luca, blamed foreign workers for the ""contagion,"" in an interview published on his Twitter account: ""As always, we worked to assure the serenity of our families. In the coming weeks I believe we will do a wide check on seasonal workers.""

A spokesperson for the Italian Interior Minister told CNN that military controls were ending Tuesday night with only 10 positive cases remaining in the building, which they said local health authorities could easily monitor.

And in Serbia, police in the capital Belgrade on Tuesday fired tear gas at protesters demonstrating against the President Aleksandar Vucic after he announced a weekend-long curfew to try to combat a surge in cases.

On Tuesday, Serbia recorded its highest daily death toll from Covid-19 since the start of the pandemic, with Vucic calling the situation in Belgrade ""alarming.""

Lockdown towns

The English city of Leicester returned to lockdown for two weeks from July 2, with non-essential businesses shutting, people advised to minimize social contact, and schools closed for most children, after a spike in cases there.

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned that Leicester showed ""the virus is out there still circling like a shark in the water,"" raising fears of further lockdowns in other UK areas with rising numbers of new cases. After UK pubs opened last weekend, three establishments announced they were shutting because customers had tested positive for the coronavirus.

Leicester couple Naeem and Aisha Brisco formed an organization called Project Hope with two friends, to deliver food and necessities to vulnerable people in the community.

Naeem Brisco, whose IT company is currently closed, told CNN more people seemed to be struggling financially this time around. ""I have noticed that there's been more calls coming through,"" he said.

Signs explaining social distancing on display during the second lockdown in the English city of Leicester.

He said there were now more test centers, boards displaying distancing rules, leaflets delivered to people's homes in different languages, and police patrolling streets and stopping cars.

With the rest of the country able to visit relatives and return to pubs after England's lockdown was eased on July 4, ""Leicester feels a bit left out,"" he said.

Brisco said support was coming from the grassroots. ""I think mainly the locals are getting together and just trying to be there for their neighbors and family.""

The charity Save the Children says more than 25,000 children live in poverty in Leicester; it has warned that deprivation could soar during the new lockdown.

Campaign group Labour Behind the Label last week suggested conditions in Leicester's garment factories were increasing the risk of coronavirus transmission among low-paid and often migrant workers.

But Brisco stressed it was important not to stereotype areas. ""I can see a lot of unity and we talk about ethnic minorities, I get that, but if we remember, we've got people of all backgrounds in Leicester. Certain words that we use can put people in a minority position.""

He said people were ""scared"" but happy to do what needed to be done to contain the spread of the virus.

As for businesses: ""How long they can sustain for, I don't know,"" he said.

Sharifah Sekalala, Associate Professor at Warwick Law School, told CNN it was ""a real concern"" that local lockdowns could mean ""communities that are already deprived might then get deprived even further.""

She said the onus should not be on people who work in factories, use public transport, live in crowded housing or face social deprivation to enforce social distancing.

""What you end up with is just really easily stigmatizing all of certain groups of people,"" she said. ""This is really problematic, in terms of class but also in terms of ethnic groups that certain groups are going to be disproportionately more affected.""

Sekalala said government should hold industries to account -- as when the French government took Amazon to court for not practicing social distancing -- and ""think really carefully about what a social safety net looks like in times of a crisis.""

This includes providing appropriate housing that is not as densely populated, making sure transport to workplaces is socially distanced, and ensuring people can sustain themselves in the long term -- not just receiving furlough payments before losing their job.

Sekalala said lockdowns should not be ""punitive"" towards a particular region. ""We need to shift the narrative about this localized lockdown, because it seems to me that the people who are locking down make a personal sacrifice on behalf of the whole country,"" she said.

Second state of emergency

In the Australian state of Victoria , 6.6 million people have been isolated from the rest of the country for six weeks after Melbourne saw a record rise in daily case numbers.

On Saturday, 3,000 residents of nine densely populated public housing estates were put under full lockdown and from Wednesday, residents in metropolitan Melbourne are no longer allowed to leave their homes, except for grocery shopping, caregiving, exercise or work.

Victoria's border with New South Wales will close for the first time since the pandemic began.

Police stop and question drivers at a checkpoint on July 8 in the Australian border town of Albury.

""We know we're on the cusp of something very, very bad if we don't get on top of this,"" Victoria's State Premier Daniel Andrews told reporters Tuesday, describing the surge in numbers as unsustainable.

""I think a sense of complacency has crept into us as we let our frustrations get the better of us,"" Andrews said.

Melbourne cafe owner Steffan Tissa told CNN that he switched to takeout service for around three months before reopening to dine-in customers recently. Now his cafe, West 48, is closing its doors again. Tissa said he understands it's a necessity, but it will be ""difficult"" for his business.

""When it first started, we had to let staff go,"" he said. ""And then as the lockdown started to ease off, we brought new staff on.

""We've been quite encouraged by it and now to have to go back, we're in a state of limbo, you know, where will our new normal be just in terms of how trade goes?"" he said. ""Financially, it could be quite a challenge.""

Large-scale second lockdowns

Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, warned on Tuesday that the US is "" still knee-deep in the first wave"" of coronavirus, and seeing ""a resurgence of infections"" after never really reducing them to a safe level in the first place.

California and Florida closed beaches over the holiday weekend. Colorado is closing bars for July. Arizona has shut bars, gyms, and other businesses for a month.

New York, New Jersey and Connecticut are asking people from 16 states to self-quarantine upon arrival, while Massachusetts is doing the same for all bar seven northeastern states.

Israel has re-imposed strict limitations across the whole country, closing event halls, bars, gyms and pools after the country hit a record daily figure of 1,140 new infections.

It is facing a near 40-fold increase in daily cases from mid-May, when the nation appeared to have the virus under control.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a cabinet meeting Monday that ""we must take immediate steps that will prevent us from having to take even more extreme measures later.""

But Kekulé, the virology professor, believes that large-scale reopening and then locking down again is a mistake, and risks causing psychological or economic damage to those affected.

""We need a reliable picture of our future or the economy,"" he told CNN. ""You cannot plan when you have the possibilities of lockdowns at any time. People will not do that several times, again and again.

""In the United States, or also in Brazil, we have the situation that the people are beginning to fight against lockdowns and I understand why they are doing that,"" he said.

""Instead of braking and accelerating, we needed a completely different concept... some kind of continuous response to the disease or to the outbreak.

""Whenever we loosen these lockdowns without having a replacement strategy you will get outbreaks again, because you have only very few people who are immune.""

This could be the most complex and nuanced phase of the pandemic yet.",2020-07-09,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/09/health/local-lockdowns-leicester-melbourne-gutersloh-intl/index.html
Madeline Holcombe,Louisiana governor says progress against coronavirus has been wiped out in past three weeks,"(CNN) The gains the people of Louisiana made against Covid-19 in June have been wiped out over the past three weeks, Gov. John Bel Edwards said Wednesday.

""We have a statewide pandemic. It's no longer one or two regions,"" Edwards told reporters in Baton Rouge.

Edwards' announcement comes as the United States passed 3 million coronavirus cases.

Louisiana's health department reported 1,891 new cases Wednesday, 95% of which are from community spread, according to Edwards. Data from Johns Hopkins University shows the moving seven-day average of cases in the state hasn't been this high since early April.

Some hospitals are running out of ICU capacity

In Florida, 42 hospitals on Wednesday had no more capacity in their intensive care units -- down from 56 a day earlier -- and others are running low, but the state Agency for Health Care Administration said, ""Hospitals have the ability to convert beds and bring additional ICU beds online in a surge situation when necessary.""

Dr. Nicholas Namias, the medical director at the trauma center at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami, told CNN's ""The Lead with Jake Tapper"" that it is a balancing act between trying to have isolation bed capacity and treating other patients who need routine care.

""Right now we're not looking at anything apocalyptic going on in the hospital but we are flirting every day with the edge of capacity,"" he said.

He said some of the Covid patients are young people who are on ventilators.

In Arizona, the state has set records for daily death counts about once a week, including Tuesday -- the same day the state reported its lowest-ever number of ICU beds available.

""We need medical professionals. We need testing kits. We need supplies immediately,"" Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego said Tuesday. ""Our hospital is already in dire straits, and they tell us in the next two weeks it is going to get to an unbearable level of crisis.""

On Georgia's coronavirus website, the Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency says 18% of critical care hospital beds remain available and 17% of inpatient beds are available statewide. The figures are several percentage points lower than a week ago.

The pandemic worsens

The first reported case of Covid-19 came on January 21. Within 99 days, 1 million Americans became infected.

It took just 43 days after that to reach 2 million cases.

And 28 days later, on Wednesday, the US reached 3 million cases of the novel coronavirus.

The ferocious speed at which Covid-19 spreads has astounded doctors, with more than 132,000 people dying from the disease since January, according to data from Johns Hopkins University

The rate of new cases is increasing in 35 states, threatening to reverse the progress made during weeks of stressful shutdowns and stay-at-home orders.

The United States must control crowds, get people wearing masks and do a better job on physical distancing to get on top of the surging coronavirus pandemic as cases spike across parts of the South and Southwest, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's leading infectious disease expert, said Wednesday.

""We've got to get our arms around this,"" Fauci told the Wall Street Journal in a new podcast. ""We've got to be stringent.""

Dr. Boris Lushniak, a past deputy US surgeon general, told CNN governments should adhere to the White House plan for reopening that was announced in April.

""The key feature of the plan was if the numbers don't look good, if certain areas are still being affected, there is this mandate within that plan to roll back, to go back and be able to reassess what we're doing from a public health measures perspective to prevent further disease, to prevent further deaths and to stop this spread of Covid-19,"" he told Wolf Blitzer. ""The plan is there, let's follow it.""

'Wear a mask, period.'

As of Monday, 35 states plus Washington, DC, and Puerto Rico had implemented some type of mask requirement. Fauci is ""strongly in favor"" of the mandates to curb the spread, he said.

""When you look at what we can do that we know works, it's the use of masks, physical distance and avoiding crowds,"" Fauci said Tuesday. ""So, if you're saying it doesn't matter whether you put it on or take it off, you're giving a wrong, mixed signal. The signal should be: Wear a mask, period.""

If most Americans heed the directive, as many as 45,000 fewer Americans will die of coronavirus this fall, according to Dr. Chris Murray, the director of the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.

The latest model, released Tuesday, projects as many as 208,000 coronavirus deaths by November 1.

The new death rate stems from the recent surge in cases combined with seasonality and schools reopening, Murray said.

The number drops to 163,000 if most Americans wear a face mask, according to the model.

""It's an incredibly simple strategy and intervention,"" Murray said. ""It's one that will save lives, but it will also help the economy enormously because it will avoid shutdowns which will inevitably come when things get quickly out of control in some states.""

Some college students may return in fall

Colleges and universities across the country are navigating how to safely reopen and keep students in the classroom come fall.

New York University has implemented mask and social distancing measures for the next semester. Caps will be placed on enrollment and space capacity, and classroom occupancy will be reduced by 50%, according to an email from NYU leadership to the community.

As of July 15, all students, faculty and visitors at the University System of Georgia will also be mandated to wear masks, USG announced on its website.

Though Columbia University announced undergraduates and students of Columbia College and the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science will return in the fall, only 60% will be welcomed back. Most classes will still be taught in remote or hybrid form.

Brown University will shift its calendar and add a summer term to accommodate more students on campus at separate times, according to a letter to students from university President Christina Paxson.

The university will also offer virtual learning courses to all students, regardless of whether they are living on campus, and all classes with more than 20 students will be conducted remotely.

Advocates of higher education asked Congress on Tuesday to approve federal aid to help colleges and universities avoid budget cuts in the upcoming academic year.

""Higher education is a public good that benefits the entirety of our nation and our nation's position in a global economy,"" said Shaun Harper, president of the American Educational Research Association.

""Therefore, federal investment into higher education is really an investment into the economic security, the homeland security and the viability of the United States.""",2020-07-08,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/08/health/us-coronavirus-wednesday/index.html
Brian Fung,"TikTok is a national security threat, US politicians say. Here's what experts think","Washington (CNN Business) The short-form video app TikTok has quickly become a key part of popular culture in the US, serving as a platform for viral memes as well as political satire and activism . Facebook, the dominant force in social media, has tried to copy the app, but so far that has not slowed down its rapid rise.

But now TikTok faces the most direct threat to its expansion in the US -- not from a competitor, but from the US government. President Donald Trump said Tuesday his administration is ""looking at"" banning the app, which is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, affirming remarks on Monday by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

It's just the latest, and most high-profile, example of Washington raising alarms about the app that's popular among younger users in the US, where TikTok has been downloaded 165 million times . Other prominent critics have previously highlighted TikTok as a potential spying threat. Last year, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Arkansas Republican Sen. Tom Cotton called for the intelligence community to assess the risk TikTok may pose to national security.

TikTok has pushed back on those claims, calling them ""unfounded."" To underscore its independence from China, TikTok has cited its recently hired American CEO, and said it has ""never provided user data to the Chinese government, nor would we do so if asked.""

The US is not alone in seeking to clamp down on TikTok. India said this week it would ban TikTok and other Chinese apps after a bloody border clash between Indian and Chinese soldiers.

Although leaders like Pompeo have described TikTok as a clear and present danger, many in the cybersecurity community say the reality is more complex. While TikTok could become a clear threat to US security under certain scenarios, they say, the danger is currently largely hypothetical or indirect. Some analysts also say the matter is complicated by Trump's aggressive approach to China overall — arguing the situation is a reflection of the administration's political priorities. Experts have raised similar concerns about Trump's approach to Huawei, the Chinese tech giant, saying Trump has inappropriately conflated national security with trade negotiations.

""The Trump administration has taken almost like a whack-a-mole approach to dealing with these issues, because it seems that as soon as a Chinese company is in the news, all of a sudden that becomes the new target,"" said Justin Sherman, a fellow with the Cyber Statecraft Initiative at the Atlantic Council. ""It seems very unlikely that there is thinking going on about the longer term strategy, and much more likely that the focus instead is on this politically motivated attack on an application because it's a Chinese-owned app, even if there are real security questions.""

The China question

To understand why policymakers view TikTok as a risk, it helps to know how the company works. TikTok is owned by the world's most valuable startup , a Chinese company named ByteDance. But TikTok does not operate in China and functions as an independent subsidiary.

Policymakers' chief worry is that ByteDance could be forced to hand over TikTok's data on US users to the Chinese government, under the country's national security laws. TikTok has said it stores American user data on US-based servers that aren't subject to Chinese law; skeptics argue TikTok's parent, ByteDance, is ultimately a Chinese business that's still beholden to Beijing.

But several security experts told CNN Business that, although TikTok's links to a private Chinese company are worthy of concern, the app simply wouldn't be that useful for espionage.

""It's right to be suspicious of the Chinese,"" said James Lewis, senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a security think tank. ""But I'm not sure TikTok is a good intelligence tool for them.""

Like some other social media apps and technology companies, TikTok automatically gathers users' geolocation information, IP addresses, unique device identifiers and the content of in-app messages, according to its privacy policy . That is a lot of data, but far more sensitive information -- and potentially more damaging to national security -- was exposed by data breaches affecting the Office of Personnel Management, announced in 2015, and Equifax, disclosed in 2017, according to Lewis.

China's national security laws contain more gray areas than many realize, according to Samm Sacks, a senior fellow at Yale Law School who has studied the Chinese laws. Chinese companies have successfully Even if TikTok collected enough of the right kind of data from the right people to pose a unique threat, it is not guaranteed the Chinese government would be able to access it easily.China's national security laws contain more gray areas than many realize, according to Samm Sacks, a senior fellow at Yale Law School who has studied the Chinese laws. Chinese companies have successfully resisted or thrown up roadblocks to Beijing's demands for data in the past, Sacks told lawmakers at a Senate hearing in March.

""The Chinese government does not necessarily have unfettered real-time access to all companies' data,"" Sacks said in her testimony. ""Chinese corporate actors are not synonymous with the Chinese government or the Chinese Communist Party, and have their own commercial interests to protect.""

Concerning security flaws

An alarming technical report about TikTok this year has only added to the concerns about its security, though experts say there is an important distinction between identifying individual security gaps and labeling something a threat to national security.

In January, a team of security researchers announced they had found several vulnerabilities in TikTok. The flaws, if left unpatched, could have let attackers gain control of TikTok accounts, change the privacy settings on TikTok videos, upload videos without permission, and obtain user data such as email addresses.

The discovery raised important questions about TikTok's ability to safeguard user privacy. But company engineers appeared to operate in good faith, according to Oded Vanunu, a security specialist at Check Point Research, who led the group of researchers that announced the findings. TikTok, he said, seemed motivated to fix the flaws.

""They were concerned about the optics of it, and their PR people, there was some friction there,"" said Vanunu. ""But from our perspective they were very happy to get this kind of information and were happy to cooperate.""

Asked whether the vulnerabilities he found might lend credence to claims TikTok cannot be trusted, Vanunu said security flaws are something that all software companies grapple with, even large ones . The difference, he said, is that TikTok is a relatively young and inexperienced company.

""TikTok is committed to protecting user data,"" TikTok said in a statement at the time of the disclosure. ""Like many organizations, we encourage responsible security researchers to privately disclose zero day vulnerabilities to us.""

The bigger concern with TikTok

Even as technical experts describe TikTok's espionage risk in mostly theoretical terms, policymakers argue TikTok could still threaten US interests in softer ways — by influencing the global conversation on its platform. And in this respect, some experts warn, the danger is already being felt.

TikTok has faced mounting criticism, for example, over its handling of content that's critical of the Chinese government. Last year The Guardian reported on leaked documents that it said instructed moderators to clamp down on critiques of socialism and Tiananmen Square. ByteDance told The Guardian at the time that those guidelines were outdated.

In November, allegations of politically motivated censorship increased when several former US employees of TikTok told The Washington Post they often felt pressured to clamp down on videos that their colleagues in Beijing found subversive, prompting Schumer and Cotton to express concerns in their letter to intelligence officials.

TikTok has said that its content and moderation policies are developed by a team of American employees and that the policies are not influenced by any foreign government. TikTok's investors include large international names such as Sequoia Capital and Softbank, and in May, the company hired Kevin Mayer, a former Disney executive, as its CEO.

TikTok could become a major platform for misleading speech, policymakers and security experts fear. Reports have already found In addition to restricting some speech,TikTok could become a major platform for misleading speech, policymakers and security experts fear. Reports have already found Pizzagate conspiracy theorists on the platform and users spreading false claims about the coronavirus . And if TikTok were to suffer a data breach, said Vanunu, it might be that much easier to target users with bogus information that could undercut American democracy.

So TikTok's handling of content and user data could plausibly weaken US power and influence, experts say, but more abstractly than directly spying on government officials or monitoring troop movements.

That says more about the US's lack of policies regulating data, privacy and platforms than it does about TikTok, many of them said.

""I think people are blending a lot of different values here related to human rights, privacy, censorship — and it's at risk of getting bundled into a security argument,"" said Karl Grindal, a cybersecurity expert at Georgia Tech.",2020-07-09,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/09/tech/tiktok-security-threat/index.html
Jordan Valinsky,Walmart is about to give Amazon Prime a serious run for its money,"New York (CNN Business) Walmart is reportedly close to launching its own membership program that closely resembles Amazon Prime.

The retailer plans to unveil Walmart+ in July, a $98 per year service that includes same-day delivery, fuel discounts and other perks, according to Recode. Introduction of the service was pushed back from the spring because of the pandemic and it's unclear if it will initially launch nationally.

Walmart WMT declined to comment.

If Walmart+ enjoys just a fraction of success of Amazon Prime, Walmart should be pleased. Amazon recently said it has 150 million subscribers paying $119 annually. Prime includes expedited shipping, streaming entertainment, same-day grocery delivery and early access to deals.

""Prime membership continues to get better for customers year after year. And customers are responding — more people joined Prime this quarter than ever before,"" CEO Jeff Bezos said in January.

Matt Egan,Americans are rapidly shrinking their credit card debt during the pandemic,"New York (CNN Business) Americans' credit card debt is shrinking rapidly during the coronavirus recession. That's a sharp contrast with the last two economic downturns.

The amount of consumer revolving credit, which is mostly credit cards, plunged by another $24 billion in May, the Federal Reserve said Wednesday. This costly form of debt is down more than $100 billion since hitting a record high in February and is now below $1 trillion for the first time in nearly three years.

The dwindling pile of credit card debt is yet more evidence of how drastically consumer behavior is changing during the pandemic and this period of financial insecurity.

In many ways, it makes perfect sense that Americans are swiping the plastic less. The health crisis, forced the widespread shutdown of restaurants, bars and professional sports. That was especially true during the March-May period captured by the Fed data.

""Consumers had no choice but to spend less on their credit cards,"" Danielle DiMartino Booth, CEO and chief strategist at Quill Intelligence, wrote in a note to clients Thursday.

Not surprisingly, spending at restaurants imploded during the spring when health restrictions made eating out impossible in many parts of the nation.

The seven-day average of spending (including on credit cards) at big chain restaurants was down by as much as 40% in April from the year before, according to Bank of America. That metric has since recovered in June to normal levels, Bank of America said.

Mass unemployment, wave of bankruptcies

At the same time, Americans are wisely paying down outstanding credit card balances and avoiding racking up new debt during this economically tumultuous period.

""Americans are behaving in an eminently rational fashion,"" said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM International.

The unemployment rate surged to 14.7% in April. It has since dipped to 11.1% due to blockbuster job gains , though that unemployment rate is still higher than at any point during the Great Recession.

Given that backdrop, it's little surprise that Americans are pulling back on debt. The March-May period marked the first time in a decade that overall consumer credit declined for three months in a row, according to Oxford Economics.

However, some types of debt are showing signs of life. Specifically, the amount of nonrevolving credit, which is mostly student debt and auto loans, actually rose by $6 billion in May.

Signals consumers are hunkering down

Credit card debt typically carries punishing interest rates -- even for borrowers with the strongest credit scores. The fact that this type of pricey debt is shrinking is encouraging given the economic uncertainty.

However, this trend, along with the surging saving rate, also reflects a broader hunkering down among Americans that is problematic for an economy that is two-thirds driven by consumer spending.

""That's bad news for the economy,"" Brusuelas said. ""You want a confident consumer to expense her income. We're just not seeing that right now.""

Shrinking credit card debt also highlights the unprecedented support being provided by Uncle Sam right now.

More so than during the onset of the past two recessions, Congress and the White House have taken bold steps to provide emergency relief to households and businesses via the CARES Act.

Specifically, stimulus checks of up to $1,200 per household were sent out in the spring. And the federal government is providing $600 of extra weekly unemployment benefits for people who lost their jobs during the pandemic.

Stimulus cliff

Taken together, those emergency moves have lessened the reliance on swiping the plastic.

""The need for credit cards as a smoothing mechanism has been greatly diminished,"" according to Booth, the Quill Intelligence CEO. ""The credit cycle that would have begun to emerge has been frozen by the CARES Act.""

But the problem is the $600 of enhanced unemployment benefits expires at the end of July. And there is a heated debate among economists and politicians about whether extending them at the current level -- or at all -- will discourage Americans to look for new jobs.

What is clear, however, is that letting this benefit lapse will force some unemployed Americans, particularly those in lower-income households, to rely on expensive credit card debt to make ends meet.

That means the recent plunge in credit card debt may prove to be short-lived -- but potentially for the wrong reasons.",2020-07-09,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/09/investing/credit-card-debt-recession/index.html
Hanna Ziady,This small island chain is leading the way on hydrogen power,"London (CNN Business) Too much clean energy. It's an unusual problem to have, and one that's spurred a group of islands off the northern coast of Scotland to become an unlikely pioneer in hydrogen power .

Orkney, better known for its breathtaking coastal scenery and some of Britain's oldest heritage sites than for its cutting edge approach to energy , has been quietly pioneering hydrogen technology.

Abundant rainfall, strong winds and powerful waves mean the island chain's entire electricity demand is already met through renewable resources . But in recent years, Orkney's grid couldn't handle the amount of power being generated from its ever expanding wind farms, Megan McNeill, Orkney projects manager at Community Energy Scotland, told CNN Business.

Wind turbines needed to be switched off on a daily basis, as power cables reached capacity, leaving clean energy unused.

Rather than waste the excess electricity, the islands decided to harness it. It was here that in 2017 the European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC), in a world first, used tidal energy to split water and make hydrogen — a process known as electrolysis.

That was just the beginning. The success of that project spurred collaboration between EMEC, Community Energy Scotland and others to do the same with excess wind energy. Surf 'n' Turf, a project funded by the Scottish government, combined excess electricity from tidal and wind turbines to create hydrogen, another world first.

Hydrogen is viewed as an important part of the transition to a cleaner future because it emits no carbon. It can also be stored and is seen as a potential replacement to natural gas

But traditional hydrogen production relies almost entirely on fossil fuels and is responsible for 830 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions a year. That is equivalent to the CO2 emissions of the United Kingdom and Indonesia combined, according to the International Energy Agency.

Producing hydrogen power remains expensive, but Orkney's success in creating hydrogen using clean energy demonstrates that it can be done at scale. The islands are already using hydrogen to power vehicles, and it will soon be used to heat a local primary school.

Now, Orkney is hoping to use hydrogen fuel cells to power a seagoing vessel able to transport both goods and passengers.

""We're hoping it can be the world first,"" said hydrogen manager at EMEC, Jon Clipshim, adding, ""there is a race on.""

— Jenny Marc contributed to this report.

Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that hydrogen power was being used to power a primary school.",2020-03-13,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/13/business/orkney-hydrogen-power/index.html
Bill Weir,Rising seas are turning Miami's high ground into hot property,"Miami (CNN) In a city where ""sunny day floods"" increased 400% in a decade, rising seas are changing the old real estate mantra of ""location, location, location.""

In Miami these days, it's all about elevation, elevation, elevation.

And long before melted ice caps wash over Ocean Drive, one of America's most vulnerable big cities is becoming a test case for the modern problem of climate gentrification.

While some scientific models predict enough polar ice melt to bring at least 10 feet of sea level rise to South Florida by 2100, just a modest 12 inches would make 15% of Miami uninhabitable, and much of that beachside property is among America's most valuable.

Even now, as more frequent ""king tides"" bubble up through Florida's porous limestone, pushing fish through sewers and onto streets, residents are becoming more aware that their city is built on the rippling shelves, ridges and canyons of a fossil seabed.

""Water is simply going back to the same places it flowed ages ago,"" says Sam Purkis, Chair of the University of Miami's Geosciences Department. ""The irony is what happened 125,000 years ago is going to dictate what happens to your house now.""

The fickle undulations between city blocks could mean the difference between survival and retreat, and the rising cost of altitude is sparking a noticeable shift in community activism and municipal budgets.

In Pinecrest, artist Xavier Cortada installed murals showing how many feet above sea level intersections are.

Neighbors in Pinecrest formed America's first Underwater Homeowners Association (complete with elevation yard signs) and named a marine scientist as president.

Miami Beach is spending millions elevating roads, upgrading pumps and changing building codes to allow residents to raise their mansions by five feet.

But in working-class, immigrant neighborhoods like Little Haiti, year-to-year sea level rise gets lost in the day-to-day struggle, and most had no idea that they live a lofty three feet higher than the wealthy folks on Miami Beach.

They found out when developers started calling, from everywhere.

""They were calling from China, from Venezuela. Coming here with cases of money!"" says Marleine Bastien, a community organizer and longtime resident. ""We used to think that the allure of Little Haiti was the fact that it's close to downtown, close to both airports and close to the beach. Unbeknownst to us, it's because we are positioned at a higher altitude.""

Pointing out a row of vacant shops, she ticks off the names of a dozen small business owners she says have been forced out by rising rents, and lists others who she says unwittingly took lowball offers with no understanding of Miami's housing crisis.

""If you sell your home in Little Haiti, you think that you're making a big deal, and it's only after you sell, and then you realize, 'Oh, I cannot buy anywhere else.'""

Marleine Bastien, center, protests with residents and activists against the Magic City plans.

After her community center and day school were priced out of three different buildings, she caught wind of plans to build the sprawling $1 billion Magic City development on the edge of Little Haiti, featuring a promenade, high-end retail stores, high rise apartments and imagined by a consortium of local investors, including the founder of Cirque du Soleil.

Magic City developers insist that they picked the site based on location, not elevation.

A view of downtown Miami and South Beach from a plane shows the oceanfront development of the past.

They promised to preserve the soul of Little Haiti and give $31 million to the community for affordable housing and other programs, but it wasn't enough for Bastien. ""This is a plan to actually erase Little Haiti,"" she says. ""Because this is the one place where immigration and climate gentrification collide.""

She fought the development with all the protesters and hand-lettered signs she could muster, but after a debate that went until 1 a.m., commissioners approved the permit with a 3-0 vote at the end of June.

""The area we took was all industrial,"" says Max Sklar, VP with Plaza Equity Partners and a member of the development team. ""There was no real thriving economy around these warehouses or vacant land. And so our goal is to create that economy.

""Can we appease everybody? Not 100%, that's not feasible. It's not realistic. But we've listened to them.""

He repeats a promise to deliver $6 million to a Little Haiti community trust before ground is even broken and, as a sign that he listened to at least one demand, acknowledges that the complex will now be called Magic City Little Haiti.

But while Bastien mourns the defeat, her neighbor and fellow organizer Leonie Hermantin welcomes the investment and hopes for the best. ""Even if Magic City did not come today, the pace of gentrification is so rapid that our people will not be able to afford homes here anyways,"" she says with a resigned head shake. ""Magic City is not the government. Affordable housing policies have to come from the government.""

A woman uses an umbrella for shade as she walks on a hot day in Miami.

""(Climate gentrification) is something that we are very closely monitoring,"" Miami Mayor Francis Suarez tells me. ""But we haven't seen any direct evidence of it yet.""

Suarez is the rare Republican who passionately argues for climate mitigation plans and helped champion the $400 million Miami Forever bond, approved by voters to fund action to protect the city from the ravages of higher seas and stronger storms.

Miami Mayor Francis Suarez championed a plan to tackle the impact of the climate crisis.

""We actually created in our first tranche of Miami Forever, a sustainability fund for people to renovate their homes so that they can stay in their properties rather than having to sell their properties,"" he says.

But that fund is a relatively small $15 million, not enough to dent a housing crisis that grows with each heat wave and hurricane, in a city where over a quarter of residents live below the poverty level.

What's happening in Little Haiti could be just one example of a ""climate apartheid"" that the United Nations warns is ahead , where there will be a gulf between the rich who can protect themselves from the impact of climate change and the poor who are left behind.

Philip Alston, the UN Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, said there was already evidence of how the climate crisis affects the rich and poor differently.

And he pointed out that those hurt most were likely those least responsible. ""Perversely, while people in poverty are responsible for just a fraction of global emissions, they will bear the brunt of climate change, and have the least capacity to protect themselves,"" Alston wrote last month.",2019-07-11,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/07/11/us/miami-little-haiti-climate-gentrification-weir-wxc/index.html
Stephanie Bailey,Climate change: How rich people could help save the planet,"(CNN) Rich people don't just have bigger bank balances and more lavish lifestyles than the rest of us -- they also have bigger carbon footprints.

The more stuff you own, and the more you travel, the more fossils fuels are burned, and the more greenhouse gases are emitted into the atmosphere.

Jetting around, buying luxury goods, keeping mansions warm and driving supercars -- they all have a carbon footprint.

Oxfam has estimated that the average carbon footprint of someone in the world's richest 1% could be 175 times that of someone in the poorest 10%. Studies also show that the poor suffer the most from climate change

But some argue that the wealthy can do the most to help fix the climate crisis. Here's how they could make a difference.

Spend wisely

The buying decisions of the rich mean much more in the fight against climate change than those of most people.

Ilona Otto and her colleagues at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research estimated that the typical ""super-rich"" household of two people (which they defined as having net assets of more than $1 million, excluding their main home) has a carbon footprint of 129 tons of CO2 a year. That's around 65 tons of CO2 a year per person, which is over 10 times the global average.

Otto noted that because the sample in the study was small, the numbers are illustrative. ""Probably our estimates are even lower than the true emissions of millionaires,"" she said.

""Regarding their own lifestyle choices, the rich can change a lot,"" said Otto. ""For instance, putting solar panels on the roofs of their houses. They can also afford electric cars and the best would be if they avoided flying.""

In the study, air travel accounted for more than half of the footprint of a super-rich couple.

German architects Aktivhaus say this home generates twice as much energy as it consumes.

Rich people also have more flexibility to make changes.

""A high-income consumer likely has access and is able to afford more climate-friendly products or produce from local farmers,"" said Tom Bailey, who contributed to a new report that highlights consumption in high-income cities.

""High-income cities and high-income individuals also have the resources to trial new products, services and solutions,"" he explained, adding that they have the capacity to create a market for more sustainable goods.

Divestment

As well as choosing what to spend money on, rich people can choose what industries to invest in -- or not to invest in.

Oxfam estimates that the number of billionaires on the Forbes list with business interests in the fossil fuel sector rose from 54 in 2010 to 88 in 2015, and the size of their fortunes expanded from over $200 billion to more than $300 billion.

Steam rises from a coal-fired power plant in Germany.

But there's a trend of wealthy investors selling their shares in climate-harming industries, known as divestment.

Over 1,100 organizations and 59,000 individuals, with combined assets totaling $8.8 trillion, have pledged to divest from fossil fuels through the online movement DivestInvest

Among them is Hollywood actor Leonardo DiCaprio , who signed the pledge on behalf of himself and his environment foundation -- as well as a group of 22 affluent individuals from the Netherlands who pledged to remove their personal wealth from the top 200 oil, gas and coal companies.

""You don't invest in coal, you don't invest in oil, in gas, also in some car companies that produce normal cars, or aviation, so you direct the financial flows,"" said Otto.

And with divestment, a little can go a long way. ""We did some simulations that shows that with the divestment movement you don't need everyone to divest,"" said Otto. ""If the minority of investors divest, the other investors will not invest in those fossil fuel assets because they will be afraid of losing money ... even if they have no environmental concerns.""

Wealth means power

Wealthy people are not just economic decision makers, they can have political influence too. They can fund political parties and campaigns and have access to lawmakers.

Otto argued that rich people could use their political power to instigate positive changes to climate policy.

""Those people with the highest emissions, they have the highest agency to change something,"" said Otto. ""There's so much research about the poor, the impact of climate change on the poor ... sustainable development goals and so on. But when it comes to action and sustainability and transformation, the poor cannot do anything because they are busy surviving.

""But the educated, the rich and the super-rich -- it's a completely different case. They have the money and the resources to act and they also have the social networks,"" she explained.

Fund climate research

The wealthy can also support climate research. In 2015, Microsoft founder Bill Gates committed $2 billion of his fortune to fund research and development into clean energy.

In May, a group of scientists wrote to 100 wealthy charities and families in the UK to ask for an ""extraordinary increase"" in funding for environmental and climate-related issues.

""We implore you to urgently consider significant investment to prevent further ecological catastrophe -- whether through your personal investments or your philanthropy,"" the letter said.

There's plenty of incentive for the wealthy to demand climate action: A recent UN report warned that delaying climate policies will cost the world's top companies $1.2 trillion over the next 15 years.

Role models

The super-rich might also have an influence on other people's carbon emissions.

""High status in our societies remains associated with high material wealth,"" said Otto. ""It's an aspiration to become like the very wealthy and you imitate the lifestyles of people who you want to be like.""

For example, air travel is no longer only a treat of the super-rich. This year, budget airline Ryanair was the only non-coal plant among Europe's top 10 emitters.

Ryanair is among the EU's biggest greenhouse gas emitters, according to EU data. The rankings include power stations, manufacturing plants and aviation.

""We as a society have to search for new ways of leading 'rich' lives that are independent of material wealth,"" said Stephanie Moser, of the University of Bern, in Switzerland, who found that a person's carbon footprint is better indicated by their income than their environmental beliefs.

""We have to redefine wealth in our societies such that living a ""good life"" is possible without high greenhouse gas emissions,"" she said.",2019-07-12,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/07/12/health/rich-people-climate-change-intl/index.html
Oscar Holland,Discarded photo negatives show China in an era of change,"Written by Oscar Holland, CNN

For the last decade, Thomas Sauvin has been purchasing discarded color negatives by the kilogram from a recycling plant outside Beijing. The old 35-millimeter films capture family outings, weddings, birthdays, vacations -- anonymous, everyday memories that would otherwise be lost.

The trader he buys them from, Xiao Ma, usually dissolves the negatives in acid, alongside hospital X-rays and old CD-ROMs, in order to extract the small amount of silver within. But instead, Sauvin takes them away in big rice sacks to find out what else they contain.

Quite how the negatives found their way into people's trash remains a mystery to the French collector and artist. But with the help of a local technician, he scans them in batches before adding the images to his archive.

His ongoing ""Beijing Silvermine"" project paints a compelling picture of a country undergoing profound change. The collection -- which comprises 850,000 photos -- offers an ordinary perspective on life in China that is often overlooked, said Sauvin, who lived in Beijing for over 12 years.

""The way China was depicted through contemporary photography, propaganda and journalism (offered) a portrait far from the one I was witnessing,"" he said in a phone interview. ""There was something more universal, something about collective memories, that started emerging. The photos show a side of China that was never really exported to the West.""

While the resulting images can be, at times, inexplicably surreal (an old man standing in a cacti bush, or a woman posing next to a fake shark), they are often mundane. Yet, after spending a year and half ""looking for gems,"" Sauvin realized that the strength of his archive lay not in occasional humorous discoveries, but in the bigger picture that emerged.

Most of the images were taken between 1985 and the mid-2000s, when the widespread adoption of digital cameras made film largely obsolete. It was a time of rapid economic development, and the photos show how this played out in people's lives: families posing with new household appliances or standing with statues of Ronald McDonald after fast food arrived in China in the early 1990s.

The pictures also document people's changing relationship with the medium of photography, as cameras went from expensive luxuries to everyday items.

""I have one (roll of) film -- 36 images -- that was shot over three-and-a-half years,"" Sauvin said. ""You have three consecutive birthdays of the same person. You can imagine, on very important occasions, the parents would bring out this analog camera, take one photo and then wait six months before taking another one.

""But by 2005, as analog photography becomes (more affordable), you notice that people would go to somewhere like the Summer Palace and take 36 photos in 30 minutes.""

Recurring themes

What remains consistent throughout this period, however, is the pictures' composition and what Sauvin calls ""the ritual"" of photography. Almost all of the images show subjects standing at the center and looking out to the camera.

Some common themes also emerge: women posing with flowers, twins dressed in identical clothing and people interacting with statues or public sculptures. Indeed, the collector found so many photos of people smoking at weddings (Chinese brides would often light cigarettes for male guests as thanks for their attendance) that he was able to publish an entire book of them.

New ideas constantly emerge from the collection. Sauvin's latest exhibition brings together photos from a Beijing amusement park filled with miniature replicas of famous world monuments, from the Kremlin to the Eiffel Tower. Opened in 1993, Beijing World Park encouraged visitors to collect a stamp from each landmark in a mock passport (""Go around the world in just one day,"" its catalog boasted).

What initially appears as a vintage oddity, however, tells a wider story about the country's rise. The exhibition juxtaposes photos of people next to replica landmarks with those of Chinese tourists in front of the real thing. In doing so, he explores how an evident curiosity about the outside world was satiated by the newfound income to holiday around the world.

""It seems to be quite a meaningful place,"" Sauvin said of Beijing World Park, which remains open to this day. ""It was like an educational place for people to start understanding what traveling and tourism was all about.""

Fading memories

Sauvin has become adept at deciphering where, and in what circumstances, old photos may have been taken. But it took seven years for a subject to ever identify themselves in one of his pictures.

The image in question depicts a middle-aged man laid out on rocks beside a lake (""like a mermaid,"" as the collector put it). It was a personal favorite of Sauvin's, and thus had appeared in exhibitions, posters, flyers and even as a sticker. Indeed, he had spent so much time looking at the man's image that he ""knew the guy like he was my grandfather.""

After Sauvin posted the photo on China's Twitter-like microblogging platform, Weibo, a user recognized the subject as his ex-girlfriend's father. Some messages later, the artist met the man at a Beijing restaurant in 2016 -- almost 30 years after the photo was taken by colleagues at an engineering conference.

""He was very happy, and we had a very good time,"" Sauvin said. ""In the end, I offered him a framed copy of the photo and he asked me to sign it. He looked at his wife and said, 'In a couple of years that's going to be worth a lot of money!'""

Although now based in Paris, Sauvin still visits Beijing four or five times a year. The recycler Xiao Ma calls whenever he has recovered enough negatives for a 50-kilogram bag. The price has almost tripled in the decade since the project began, rising from 28 yuan ($4) a kilogram to a ""still very reasonable"" 75 yuan (just under $11).

""It's always a bit of a gamble, because sometimes a 50-kilo bag only comes from one source -- and if that source isn't interesting, then I've just spent 400 Euros,"" he said. ""But that's part of the game, I suppose.""

The supply of negatives may soon run dry. Xiao extracts the most silver from X-rays, but Sauvin said that Chinese hospitals have gone digital, making the trade far less lucrative. But Sauvin also sources negatives from eBay-like websites and visits flea markets, which is where he stumbled across his latest project: old prints hidden in a plastic bag.

""I asked the vendor if I could open it and check inside,"" Sauvin recalled. ""And he said, 'No, you have to buy it.'""

He took the risk. After parting with around 450 yuan ($64), Sauvin looked inside to reveal a series of black-and-white photos depicting athletes mid-leap, their gravity-defying poses assuming an almost sculptural quality.

Further investigation revealed that the pictures had been taken by the photography department at Xi'an Physical Education University, in China's Shaanxi province. All had been shot in a single day in June 1960 -- at the height of Mao's Great Leap Forward, the disastrous modernization campaign that plunged the country into economic chaos and famine.

""I've never managed to find a significant number of photos from this era. People were obviously not going to photo studios, because it was a very hard time,"" said Sauvin, who has compiled the images into a new book, ""Great Leaps Forward.""

""The photos were simply beautiful -- very calm, very poetic. The athletes seemed to overcome gravity,""",2020-07-12,https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/china-beijing-silvermine-negatives/index.html
Oscar Holland,Vintage photos show British vacationers gone wild,"Written by Oscar Holland, CNN

Butlin's vacation resorts were an institution in post-war Britain. The self-contained camps -- where guests were housed in wooden chalets, fed and entertained on-site -- provided a new kind of inexpensive luxury for working families.

At a time when few could afford overseas travel, the resorts offered ""a week's holiday for a week's pay,"" as they were first advertised.

Beyond the likelihood of rain, Butlin's summer vacations were a uniquely British proposition.

Exuberant in-house entertainers, known as Redcoats, hosted singalongs, pantomimes and rounds of bingo. They held ""glamorous grandmother"" competitions, and ""knobbly knees"" contests to see which guest had the lumpiest legs. Ringo Starr's band (no, not that one) even played residencies there in the early 1960s, before he was invited to join the Beatles.

By the time photographer Barry Lewis arrived in the 1980s, however, the camps were ""getting a little bit seedy,"" as he put it.

There were fewer families and more singles, with plenty of sex and alcohol mixed in with the entertainment, Lewis said. But the 71-year-old still recalls the resorts' glamorous early reputation.

""When I was a kid, Butlin's was seen as very grand, but my parents could never afford to go,"" he said in a phone interview. ""It was made to sound amazing -- you'd have top stars performing, everything was free and there were fairgrounds.""

Launched by Billy Butlin in 1936, the camps' initial popularity was bolstered by the UK government's Holidays with Pay Act, which gave workers the right to paid leave for the first time. A site was opened in Skegness, on Britain's east coast, though more than half a dozen more would be built in British seaside towns over the next three decades.

The camps boomed after World War II, welcoming more than a million annual visitors in their mid-1960s heyday. Upon taking a teenage summer job at a Butlin's kitchen in 1966, Lewis found them to be ""enclosed, hermetic worlds"" equipped with theaters, recreation halls, ballrooms, pools, funfairs, boating lakes, hair salons and even churches.

""You were in this enclosed system,"" he recounted. ""You went to this other world. Russia could have invaded America and we wouldn't even have known about it -- there were no TVs in the chalets.

""But there was actually something wonderful about it. You felt you'd joined this weird club. It was very clever in making you feel (as if you were) part of a family.""

Warts and all

Lewis' teenage experiences hint at the wilder behavior he would later encounter. This ""enclosed fantasy world"" (as the photographer describes it in his new book ) was also equipped with bars, discos and betting shops.

""I served breakfasts and learned about becoming a man. I was desperate to fall in love, and all the stuff that goes with leaving home for the first time,"" he said, adding that he often ""served breakfast on a hangover"" after late-night attempts to meet women. ""To be completely frank, I was trying to get laid most of the time.""

After going on to university and establishing himself as a professional photographer, Lewis returned to Butlin's in 1982 on assignment for the UK's Observer newspaper. Then aged 34, he was initially astonished at how little had changed.

Many of his images are alive with the communality and good cheer he'd remembered -- kids enjoying activities and parents singing and dancing in the entertainment halls. But things, he said, had become more salacious.

""There was a whole sex thing that was never really talked about. A lot of people went there to get laid, so there was quite a lot of sexism,"" Lewis said. ""Alcohol was the drug of choice and people got hammered. Absolutely.

""If you were trying to be part of the gang, you drank with (the Redcoats). They were young lads, but they were adored and they loved that.""

The photographer's fondness for the camps is nonetheless apparent (he describes the images as ""warts and all, but in a loving way""). He took an immersive approach to the assignment -- which meant partying and drinking with the other campers. ""That's how we worked,"" he said, referring to the journalist he accompanied, Ian Walker. ""We'd integrate ourselves.""

Yet, Lewis also acknowledges there was a certain ""darkness"" to it all.

An image from the book shows a Redcoat pinching a female guest's breast. Another shows male judges keeping an uncomfortably close eye on a participant in a ""miss lovely leg"" contest. Elsewhere, an employee is pictured asleep on the lobby floor after a heavy night, while Walker wrote in the Observer at the time that ""two skinheads started smashing up glasses,"" in a resort bar in the early hours.

An unlikely renaissance

In one of Lewis' most striking photos, he captured a man frozen mid-air just before splashing into an outdoor pool. Huge letters behind spell out one of the camps' slogans: ""Our true intent is all for your delight.""

That Billy Butlin might use a quote from ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" speaks of his lofty ambitions for the resorts. But in the 1980s, the glamour was fading. Package trips to Europe had become affordable, dampening the prestige of domestic vacations. Butlin's went into economic decline, and a number of its camps closed in the years that followed.

Yet, if the Butlin's of the 1980s differed from that of previous decades, then today's is perhaps less recognizable still. The company has since changed owners and rebranded itself, its resorts fitted with new water parks and subjected to multi-million-dollar expansions. As such, the camps are undergoing something of a renaissance, Lewis ventured.

""I think, now, it's booming again,"" he said. ""With Brexit coming up, and the currency weakened -- and also with Covid-19 -- people aren't going to travel abroad as much.

""There is something nice about not having to think about (your vacation). You just book and that's it, whereas a lot of trips are just full of planning. People like that everything's laid on.""

In a statement to CNN, Butlin's said: ""Butlin's has always been a family brand and we've been delighting families for decades. We can't wait until we can reopen our resorts and welcome our guests back to Butlin's for a much needed holiday.""",2020-07-12,https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/barry-lewis-butlins/index.html
Jen Rose Smith,50 of the world's best breads,"(CNN) — What is bread? You likely don't have to think for long, and whether you're hungry for a slice of sourdough or craving some tortillas, what you imagine says a lot about where you're from.

But if bread is easy to picture, it's hard to define.

Bread historian William Rubel argues that creating a strict definition of bread is unnecessary, even counterproductive. ""Bread is basically what your culture says it is,"" says Rubel, the author of ""Bread: A Global History."" ""It doesn't need to be made with any particular kind of flour.""

Instead, he likes to focus on what bread does: It turns staple grains such as wheat, rye or corn into durable foods that can be carried into the fields, used to feed an army or stored for winter.

Even before the first agricultural societies formed around 10,000 B.C., hunter-gatherers in Jordan's Black Desert made bread with tubers and domesticated grain.

Today, the descendants of those early breads showcase the remarkable breadth of our world's food traditions.

In the rugged mountains of Germany's Westphalia region, bakers steam loaves of dense rye for up to 24 hours, while a round of Armenian lavash made from wheat turns blistered and brown after 30 seconds inside a tandoor oven.

Ethiopian cooks ferment injera's ground-teff batter into a tart, bubbling brew, while the corn dough for Venezuelan arepas is patted straight onto a sizzling griddle.

This list reflects that diversity. Along with memorable flavor, these breads are chosen for their unique ingredients, iconic status and the sheer, homey pleasure of eating them.

In alphabetical order by location, to mark World Bread Day on October 16, here are 50 of the world's most wonderful breads.

From the rich layers of Malaysian roti canai to Turkey's seed-crusted simit, they're a journey through the essence of global comfort food -- and a reminder that creativity, like bread, is a human inheritance.

Bolani, Afghanistan

Johannes Eisele/AFP/Getty Images

Golden blisters of crisp dough speckle a perfectly made bolani, but the real treasure of Afghanistan's favorite flatbread is hidden inside.

After rolling out the yeast-leavened dough into a thin sheet, Afghan bakers layer bolani with a generous filling of potatoes, spinach or lentils. Fresh herbs and scallions add bright flavor to the chewy, comforting dish, which gets a crispy crust when it's fried in shimmering-hot oil.

Lavash, Armenia

Shutterstock

When your Armenian mother-in-law comes towards you wielding a hula hoop-sized flatbread, don't duck: Lavash is draped over the country's newlyweds to ensure a life of abundance and prosperity.

Maybe that's because making lavash takes friends.

To shape the traditional breads, groups of women gather to roll and stretch dough across a cushion padded with hay or wool. It takes a practiced hand to slap the enormous sheets onto the inside of conical clay ovens, where they bake quickly in the intense heat.

The bread is so central to Armenia's culture it's been designated UNESCO Intangible Heritage

Damper bread, Australia

Alamy

A traveler's staple suited to life on the road, damper recalls Australia's frontier days.

It's a simple blend of water, flour and salt that can be cooked directly in the ashes, pressed into a cast iron pan or even toasted at the end of a stick. These days, recipes often include some chemical leavening, butter and milk, turning the hearty backwoods fare into a more refined treat similar to Irish soda bread.

Luchi, Bangladesh

Shutterstock

A dunk in hot oil turns soft wheat dough into a blistered, golden flatbread that's a perfect pairing with the country's aromatic curries.

It's a popular choice for breakfast in Bangladesh, often served with white potato curry, but you can find the puffy breads everywhere from Dhaka sidewalk stalls to home kitchens.

Pão de queijo, Brazil

Shutterstock

It's a triumph of kitchen ingenuity that South America's native cassava is eaten at all: The starchy root has enough naturally occurring cyanide to kill a human being.

But by carefully treating cassava with a cycle of soaking, pressing and drying, many of the continent's indigenous groups found a way to turn the root into an unlikely culinary star. Now, it's the base for one of Brazil's most snackable treats, a cheesy bread roll whose crisp crust gives way to a tender, lightly sour interior.

Montreal bagels, Canada

Alamy

The fire is always lit at Montreal's Fairmount Bagel , which became the city's first bagel bakery when it opened in 1919 under the name Montreal Bagel Bakery.

Inside, bakers use long, slender wooden paddles to slide rows of bagels into the wood-fired oven, where they toast to a deep golden color.

New Yorkers might think they have a monopoly on bagels, but the Montreal version is an entirely different delicacy.

Here, bagel dough is mixed with egg and honey, and the hand-shaped rings are boiled in honey water before baking. The result is dense, chewy and lightly sweet, and you can buy them hot from the oven 24 hours a day.

Marraqueta, Chile

Shutterstock

An influx of European immigrants brought their wheat-bread traditions to Chile in the 19th and early 20th centuries, and the country's favorite snack has descended from that cultural collision.

Split into four lobes, the marraqueta has a pale, fluffy interior, but the ubiquitous roll is all about the crust. Bakers slide a pan of water into the oven to achieve an addictively crispy exterior that is a favorite part of the marraqueta for many Chileans.

It's a nourishing part of daily life, to the extent that when a Chilean wants to describe a child born to a life of plenty, they might say ""nació con la marraqueta bajo el brazo,"" or ""they were born with a marraqueta under their arm.""

Shaobing, China

Shutterstock

Crack into the sesame-seed crust of a shaobing to reveal tender layers that are rich with wheat flavor.

Expert shaobing bakers whirl and slap the dough so thin that the finished product has 18 or more layers. The north Chinese flatbread can then be spiked with sweet or savory fillings, from black sesame paste to smoked meat or Sichuan pepper.

Pan Cubano, Cuba

Shutterstock

Melted lard lends a hint of savory flavor to loaves of pan Cubano, whose fluffy crumb offers a tender contrast to the crisp, cracker-like crust.

Duck into a Cuban bakery, and you'll likely spot the long, golden loaf with a pale seam down the center: Some bakers press a stripped palmetto leaf into the dough before baking to create a distinctive crack along the length of the bread.

It's popular from Havana to Miami, but it's only stateside that you'll find the loaves in ""Cuban sandwiches,"" which are thought to have been invented during the 19th century by Cubans living in Florida.

Libba, Egypt

Jen Rose Smith

Bedouin tribes travel light in Egypt's vast deserts, carrying sacks of wheat flour to make each day's bread in the campfire.

While some Bedouin breads are baked on hot metal sheets, libba is slapped directly into the embers. That powerful heat sears a crisp, browned crust onto the soft dough, leaving the inside steaming and moist.

Pupusas, El Salvador

Walk the streets of San Salvador, and you'll never be far from the toasted-corn scent of cooking pupusas.

The griddled corn bread is both a beloved snack and a national icon.

To make pupusas, a cook wraps a filling of cheese, pork or spiced beans into tender corn dough, then pats the mixture onto a blazing-hot griddle. A bright topping of slaw-like curtido cuts through the fat and salt for a satisfying meal.

It's a flavor that's endured through the centuries. At the UNESCO-listed site of Joya de Cerén , a Maya city buried by an erupting volcano, archaeologists have found cooking tools like those used to make pupusas that date to around 600 A.D.

Injera, Ethiopia

Alamy

A constellation of bubbles pocks injera's spongy surface, making this Ethiopian bread the perfect foil for the country's rich sauces and stews.

Also beloved in neighboring Eritrea and Somalia, injera is both a mealtime staple and the ultimate utensil -- tear off tender pieces of moist, rolled-up bread to scoop food served on a communal platter.

Made from an ancient -- and ultra-nutritious -- grain called teff, injera has a characteristically sour taste. It's the result of a fermentation process that starts by blending fresh batter with cultures from a previous batch, then leaving the mixture to grow more flavorful over several days.

Baguette, France

The French may frown on eating on the go, but there's an unofficial exception for ""le quignon,"" the crisp-baked end of a slender baguette.

You're allowed to break that off and munch it as you walk down the street -- perhaps because the baguette has pride of place as a symbol of French culture.

But like some of the greatest traditions, the baguette is a relatively recent invention.

According to Paris food historian Jim Chevallier , long, narrow breads similar to modern baguettes gained prominence in the 19th century, and the first official mention is in a 1920 price list. (French President Emmanuel Macron nonetheless argues that the baguette deserves UNESCO status .)

Khachapuri, Georgia

Shutterstock

Bubbling with fresh imeruli and sulguni cheeses, khachapuri might be the country of Georgia's most beloved snack.

The savory flatbread starts with soft, yeasted dough that's pinched into a boat-shaped cradle, then baked with a generous filling of egg and cheese. An elongated shape maximizes the contrast in texture, from the tender interior to crisp, brown tips. Khachapuri experts know to break off the ends for swabbing in the rich, oozing filling.

It's such a key feature of Georgian cuisine that the Khachapuri Index is one measure of the country's economic welfare; and in 2019, the country's National Agency for Cultural Heritage Preservation named traditional khachapuri as UNESCO Intangible Heritage of Georgia.

Pumpernickel, Germany

Shutterstock

Pure rye flour lends these iconic north German loaves impressive heft, along with a distinctive, mahogany hue.

The most traditional versions are baked in a warm, steamy oven for up to 24 hours. It's an unusual technique that helps transform sugars in the rye flour, turning naturally occurring sweetness into depth of flavor.

Pumpernickel has been a specialty in Germany's Westphalia region for hundreds of years, and there's even a family-owned bakery in the town of Soest that's made the hearty bread using the same recipe since 1570.

Pai bao, Hong Kong

Shutterstock

Hong Kong bakers outdo each other by crafting the softest, fluffiest breads imaginable, turning wheat flour into pillowy confections.

Pai bao might be loftier than all the rest, thanks to a technique known as the Tangzhong method.

When mixing the wheat dough, bakers add a small amount of cooked flour and water to the rest of the ingredients, a minor change with major impact on the bread's structural development. The results? A wonderfully tender loaf that retains moisture for days, with a milky flavor that invites snacking out of hand.

Dökkt rúgbrauð, Iceland

Alamy

The simmering, geothermal heat that powers Iceland's geysers, hot springs and steam vents also provides a natural oven for this slow-baked Icelandic rye bread.

Made with dark rye flour, the dough is enclosed in a metal pot before it's buried in the warm ground near geothermal springs and other hotspots. When baked in the traditional method, dökkt rúgbrauð takes a full 24 hours to cook in the subterranean ""oven.""

It's an ingenious use of an explosive natural resource, and in the hot-springs town of Laugarvatn, visitors can try loaves of dökkt rúgbrauð when it's fresh from a hole in the black sand.

Paratha, India

Flatbreads go wonderfully flaky in this whole-wheat Indian treat, which can be eaten plain or studded with savory fillings.

Folding and rolling the dough over thinly spread fat creates sumptuous layers that are rich with flavor, employing a technique similar to that used for croissants or puff pastry.

Stuffed wheat bread has been made in India for hundreds of years, and several varieties even get a shout-out in the ""Manasollasa,"" a 12th-century Sanskrit text that contains some of the earliest written descriptions of the region's food.

Roti gambang, Indonesia

Shutterstock

Palm sugar and cinnamon lend a light, aromatic sweetness to roti gambang, a tender wheat bread that's an old-fashioned favorite at Jakarta bakeries.

The name evokes the gambang, a traditional Indonesian instrument with a resemblance to the slender, brown loaves.

For the recipe, though, cooks look back to the colonial era: From spiced holiday cookies to cheese sticks topped with Gouda or Edam, Indonesian baking has adapted Dutch ingredients and techniques to local tastes.

Sangak, Iran

Behrouz Mehri/AFP/Getty Images

It takes a pair of deft bakers to craft this addictive Iranian flatbread, which is cooked directly on a bed of hot pebbles.

That blazing-hot surface pocks the wheat dough with golden blisters, and it gives sangak -- also known as nan-e sangak -- a characteristic chewiness.

If you're lucky enough to taste sangak hot from the oven, enjoy a heavenly contrast of crisp crust and tender crumb. Eat the flatbread on its own, or turn it into an Iranian-style breakfast: Use a piece of sangak to wrap salty cheese and a bundle of aromatic green herbs.

Soda bread, Ireland

Shutterstock

You don't need yeast to get lofty bread: Chemical leavening can add air through an explosive combination of acidic and basic ingredients. While Native Americans used refined potash to leaven griddled breads -- an early example of chemical leavening -- this version became popular during the lean years of the Irish Potato Famine.

With potato crops failing, impoverished Irish started mixing loaves using soft wheat flour, sour milk and baking soda.

Now, dense loaves of soda bread are a nostalgic treat that's a perfect pairing with salted Irish butter.

Challah, Israel

Shutterstock

If you think challah is limited to pillowy, braided loaves, think again -- traditionally, challah is any bread used in Jewish ritual.

And Jewish bakers have long made breads as diverse as the diaspora itself: Think blistered flatbreads, hearty European loaves and Hungarian confections dotted with poppy seeds.

Israel's modern-day bakers draw on that rich heritage. But on Friday afternoons in Tel Aviv, you'll still spot plenty of the classic Ashkenazi versions that many people in the United States know as challah.

Those golden loaves are tender with eggs, and shiny under a generous glaze. It's the braid, though, that catches the eye. By wrapping dough strands together, bakers create twelve distinctive mounds said to represent twelve loaves in the ancient Temple of Jerusalem.

Ciabatta, Italy

Between an emphasis on ""ancient grains"" and centuries of floury traditions, it can seem like breadmaking is stuck in the past.

But bread is continually evolving, and there's no better example than this iconic Italian loaf, which was only invented in the 1980s.

In 1982, Italian baker Arnaldo Cavallari created the low, chewy loaf in defiance of the baguette-style breads he saw taking over Roman bakeries.

It was a watershed moment in the comeback of artisanal breads, which has roots in the 1960s and 1970s backlash against the increasingly industrialized food system.

Bammy bread, Jamaica

Shutterstock

Pan-fried cassava cakes are delicious comfort food in Jamaica, where rounds of bammy bread are a hearty pairing for the island's ultra-fresh seafood.

The traditional process for making bammy bread starts with processing grated cassava to get rid of naturally occurring cyanide; next, sifted cassava pulp is pressed into metal rings.

It's a recipe with ancient roots -- cassava has been a staple in South America and the Caribbean since long before the arrival of Europeans here, and it's believed that the native Arawak people used the root to make flatbreads as well.

Kare pan, Japan

Shutterstock

Yeasted wheat dough makes a convenient package for Japanese curry, turning a sit-down meal into a snack that can be eaten out of hand.

Kare pan, or curry bread, is rolled in panko before a dunk in the deep fryer, ensuring a crispy crust that provides maximum textural contrast with the soft, saucy interior.

Kare pan is so beloved that there's even a crime-fighting superhero named for the savory treat: A star of the anime series ""Soreike! Anpanman,"" Karepanman fights villains by shooting out a burning-hot curry filling.

Taboon bread, Jordan

Shutterstock

Follow the aroma of baking bread in Amman, and you'll find bakers in roadside stalls stacking this classic flatbread into steaming piles.

When shaping taboon, bakers press rounds of soft, wheat dough over a convex form, then slap them onto the interior of a conical clay oven.

What emerges is a chewy round that's crackling with steam, wafting a rich smell of grain and smoke. It's the ideal foil for a plate of Jordanian mouttabal, a roasted eggplant dip that's blended with ground sesame seeds and yogurt.

Roti canai, Malaysia

Alamy

Roti flatbread may have arrived in Malaysia with Indian immigrants, but the country's made the flaky, rich bread their own.

When cooked on a hot griddle, roti canai puffs into a stack of overlapping layers rich with buttery flavor. Irresistible when served with Malaysian dips and curries, roti canai becomes a meal all its own with the addition of stuffings from sweet, ripe bananas to fried eggs.

Ħobż tal-Malti, Malta

Shutterstock

The tawny crust of Malta's sourdough gives way to a pillow-soft interior, ideal for rubbing with a fresh tomato or soaking up the islands' prized olive oils.

Classic versions take more than a day to prepare, and were traditionally baked in shared, wood-fired ovens that served as community gathering places.

Even now that few Maltese bake their own bread, Ħobż tal-Malti has a powerful symbolism for the Mediterranean island nation.

When trying to discover someone's true nature, a Maltese person might ask ""x'ħobz jiekol dan?,"" literally, ""what kind of bread does he eat?""

Tortillas, Mexico

Lisa Cherkasky for The Washington Post/Getty Images

Thin rounds of corn dough turn blistered and brown on a hot comal, the traditional griddles that have been used in Mexico since at least 700 B.C.

Whether folded into a taco or eaten out of hand, corn tortillas are one of the country's most universally loved foods. The ground-corn dough is deceptively simple; made from just a few ingredients, it's nonetheless a triumph of culinary ingenuity.

Before being ground, the corn is mixed with an alkaline ingredient such as lime, a process called nixtamalization that makes the grain more nutritious and easier to digest.

Khobz kesra, Morocco

Follow the rich scent of baking bread through a Moroccan medina, and you may find yourself at one of the communal neighborhood ovens called ferran. This is where locals bring rounds of tender wheat dough ready to bake into khobz kesra, one of the country's homiest breads.

The low, rounded loaves have a slightly crisp exterior that earns them pride of place on the Moroccan table, where their fluffy texture is ideal for absorbing aromatic tajine sauce.

Fry bread, Navajo Nation

Luke E. Montavon/AFP/Getty Images

Golden, crisp rounds of fry bread are a taste of home for many in the Navajo Nation, as well as a reminder of a tragic history.

When Navajo people were forced out of their Arizona lands by the US government in 1864, they resettled in New Mexican landscapes where growing traditional crops of beans and vegetables proved difficult.

To survive, they used government-provided stores of white flour, lard and sugar, creating fry bread out of stark necessity.

Now, fry bread is a symbol of perseverance and tradition, and a favorite treat everywhere from powwows to family gatherings.

Tijgerbrood, Netherlands

Shutterstock

Putting the ""Dutch"" in Dutch crunch, tijgerbrood is a crust-lover's masterpiece in every crispy bite.

To create the mottled top of tijgerbrood, bakers spread unbaked loaves of white bread with a soft mixture of rice flour, sesame oil, water and yeast.

Heat transforms the exterior into a crispy pattern of snackable pieces, and loaves of tijgerbrood are beloved for sandwiches. (An ocean away from Amsterdam's Old World bakeries, San Francisco has made Dutch crunch its sandwich bread of choice as well.)

Rēwena parāoa, New Zealand

Shutterstock

When European settlers brought potatoes and wheat to New Zealand, indigenous Maori people made the imported ingredients their own with this innovative bread.

To mix the dough, potatoes are boiled then fermented into a sourdough-like starter that gives the finished bread a sweet-and-sour taste.

Now, rēwena parāoa is a favorite treat when layered with butter and jam or served with a hearty portion of raw fish, a longtime delicacy for Maori people.

Lefse, Norway

Shutterstock

If you don't think of northern Europe as flatbread country, you haven't tasted lefse.

The Norwegian potato flatbread is a favorite at holidays, when there are many hands to roll the soft dough with a grooved pin, then cook it on a hot griddle. For a taste of Norwegian comfort food, eat a warm lefse spiraled with butter, sugar and a dash of cinnamon.

While potatoes are just an 18th-century addition to the Norwegian diet, Scandinavian flatbread is at least as old as the Vikings.

Podplomyk, Poland

Shutterstock

Slather a hot round of podplomyk with white cheese and fruit preserves for a taste of old-fashioned, Polish home cooking.

The unyeasted flatbread is blistered brown. With ingredients limited to wheat flour, salt and water, podplomyk is a deliciously simple entry in the sprawling family tree of flatbreads.

Since dough for podplomyk is rolled thin, it was traditionally baked before other loaves are ready for the oven. In the Middle Ages, the portable breads were shared with neighbors and household members as a sign of friendship. (Today, that tradition is carried on with the exchange of oplatek wafers at Christmastime.)

Broa de milho, Portugal

Shutterstock

Corn and buckwheat are stone-milled, sifted and kneaded in a wooden trough for the most traditional version of this hearty peasant bread from northern Portugal.

When the loaves are baked in wood-fired, stone ovens, an archipelago of floury crust shards expands over deep cracks. The ovens themselves are sealed with bread dough, which acts as a natural oven timer: The bread is ready when the dough strips turn toasty brown.

Europeans didn't taste corn until they arrived in the Americas, but it would be eagerly adopted in northern Portuguese regions where soil conditions are poorly suited to growing wheat.

Karavai, Russia

Shutterstock

Bread baking becomes art on Russian holidays, when golden loaves of karavai are decked in dough flowers, animals and swirls.

The bread plays a starring role at weddings, with elaborate rules to govern the baking process: Traditionally, a happily married woman must mix the dough, and a married man slides the round loaf into the oven.

Even the round shape has an ancient symbolism and is thought to date back to ancient sun worship. Now, it's baked to ensure health and prosperity for a new couple.

Pane carasau, Sardinia

Shutterstock

Once part of the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia, this mountainous island's cuisine remains distinct from mainland Italy. Among the most iconic foods here is pane carasau, parchment-thin flatbread with a melodic nickname: carta de musica, or sheet music.

While pane carasau starts like a classic flatbread, there's a Sardinian twist that makes it an ideal traveling companion; after the flatbreads puff up in the oven, they're sliced horizontally into two thinner pieces. Those pieces are baked a second time, drying out the bread enough to last for months.

Proja, Serbia

Shutterstock

Warm squares of Serbian proja, or cornbread, are a favorite accompaniment to the country's lush meat stews.

It's a homey dish that's often cooked fresh for family meals, then served hot from the oven. Ground corn offers a lightly sweet foil to salty toppings, from salty kajmak cheese to a scattering of cracklings.

Gyeran-ppang, South Korea

Shutterstock

There's buried treasure within every loaf of gyeran-ppang, individually sized wheat breads with a whole egg baked inside.

Translating simply to ""egg bread,"" gyeran-ppang is a favorite in the streets of Seoul, eaten hot for breakfast -- or at any other time of day.

The addition of ham, cheese and chopped parsley adds a savory twist to the sweet-and-salty treat, a belly-warming snack that keeps South Korea fueled through the country's long winters.

Appam, Sri Lanka

Shutterstock

A thin, fermented batter of rice flour and coconut milk turns crisp in the bowl-shaped pans used for cooking appam, one of Sri Lanka's most ubiquitous treats.

Often called hoppers, this whisper-thin pancake is best eaten hot -- preferably while standing around a Colombo street food stall.

Favorite toppings for appam in Sri Lanka include coconut sambal and chicken curry, or you can order one with egg. For egg hoppers, a whole egg is cracked into the center of an appam, then topped with a richly aromatic chili paste. Appam is also popular in southern India.

Overnight fermentation lends a delicious tang to this Sudanese flatbread, balancing the mild, earthy flavor of sorghum flour with a tart bite.

Making the crepe-like kisra takes practice and patience, but perfect the art of cooking these on a flat metal pan and you'll be in for a classic Sudanese treat.

Like Ethiopian injera, kisra is both staple food and an edible utensil -- use pieces of the spongy bread to scoop up spicy bites of the hearty stews that are some of Sudan's most beloved foods.

Limpa bread, Sweden

Before commercial yeast was available, brewers and bakers worked in tandem: Brewers harvested yeast from their batches of beer, passing it off to bakers whose bread would be infused with a light beer flavor.

That legacy lives on in Sweden's vörtlimpa: Limpa means loaf, while vört refers to a tart dose of brewer's wort. Known as limpa bread in English, the light rye now gets acidity from orange juice, not brewers wort.

Crops of cold-hardy barley have thrived on the Tibetan Plateau for thousands of years, and the grain has long been a staple of high-altitude diets there.

While balep korkun is often made with wheat, traditional versions of this flatbread are shaped from tsampa, a roasted barley flour with nutty flavor.

Simit, Turkey

Dredged in sesame seeds and spiraled into rings, simit might be Turkey's ultimate on-the-go treat.

A few decades ago, vendors wound through the Istanbul streets carrying trays piled high with the breads, but roving bread-sellers are now rare in the capital.

Instead, commuters pick up their daily simit at roadside stands, where the deep-colored rings are stacked by the dozen. A burnished crust infuses the breads with a light sweetness -- before sliding into wood fired ovens, simit is dunked in sugar-water or thinned molasses, a slick glaze that turns to caramel in the intense heat.

Yeasted wheat batter bubbles into a spongy cake for this griddled treat, a British favorite when smeared with jam, butter or clotted cream.

Ring molds contain the pourable batter on an oiled griddle, which cooks one side of each crumpet to a golden hue. Like Eastern European zwieback and crisp rusks, crumpets are mostly eaten as a twice-baked bread -- the rounds are split and toasted before serving.

Biscuits, United States

Smeared with butter or dripping in gravy, biscuits are one of the United States' homiest tastes. That's not to say they're easy to make: Achieving soft, fluffy biscuits requires quick hands and gentle mixing.

In the antebellum South, biscuits were seen as a special treat for Sunday dinner. These days they're nearly ubiquitous, from gas station barbecue joints to home-cooked meals.

Part of the secret is in the flour, typically a low-protein flour like White Lily. The soft wheat used for White Lily was long grown in Southern states -- before long-distance food shipping. (It's now milled in the Midwest.)

Flatbreads become art in Uzbekistan's traditional tandoor ovens, which turn out rounds adorned with twists, swirls and stamps.

Uzbek non varies across regions, from Tashkent's chewy versions to Samarkand loaves showered in black nigella seeds. As soon as the breads emerge from the oven, they're turned over to a swarm of bicycle messengers who ferry the hot loaves to markets and cafes.

Areperos -- Venezuelan arepa-makers -- pat golden rounds of corn dough onto hot griddles to give the plump flatbreads a deliciously toasted crust and tender, steaming interior.

Arepas have been made in Venezuela and surrounding regions since long before the arrival of Europeans in South America, and the nourishing corn breads can range from simple to elaborate.

At breakfast, try them split and buttered. Stuffed with savory fillings, creamy sauces and fiery salsa, arepas can become a hearty meal all their own.

Tamara Hardingham-Gill,What it's like to visit a country that doesn't officially exist,"(CNN) — They have their own governments, passports, citizens and even currency in some cases.

But for various complicated reasons, a number of countries around the world do not officially exist -- some are even left off maps.

That didn't stop Guilherme Canever trying to visit them. The Brazilian author traveled to 16 unrecognized nations between 2009 and 2014 and recounts his experiences in his latest book ""Unrecognized Nations: Travels To Countries That Do Not Exist,"" which is released this month.

Although the definition of a country is open to interpretation, to be considered as such under International Law , a territory needs to have a permanent population, a defined territory and border controls, the ability to govern itself independently and relations with other countries.

The final hurdle is gaining recognition as a state by the United Nations, which comes with a number of benefits such as having more access to economic networks.

Those that aren't recognized by the UN are not formally acknowledged as countries, even if they're recognized by other nations, and can face many struggles as a result.

Canever became fascinated with disputed countries after visiting Somaliland, an aspiring country located in the Horn of Africa that has sought independence from Somalia since 1991.

""I was traveling through Africa by land in 2009 and ended up going to Somaliland,"" he tells CNN Travel. ""I was shocked when I realized I couldn't use Somali money there. Then I started to understand this was a nation with its own institutions, laws and currency.

""But it wasn't recognized by any other country. It felt like I was in a parallel universe.""

Despite unilaterally declaring independence from Somalia in 1991, Somaliland has never been recognized as a sovereign nation by any other country.

Fighting for recognition

Somaliland hasn't been recognized as a sovereign nation by any other country. Guilherme Canever

This has made things particularly difficult for the territory, which has faced serious economic troubles over the years.

""Somaliland is really on its own,"" explains Canever. ""They've struggled to survive because they have no allies.""

Unemployment is high here, as are illiteracy rates, but he was extremely impressed by the resilience of its locals.

""They spoke about their struggles,"" Canever adds. ""Many are dependent on the money that people working abroad sent them.

""Because they are not recognized [as a country,] it's very difficult to make exchanges with other countries.

""It's very hard for them to sell anything. So a lot of the people take the opportunity to work in other countries.

""It's a very difficult situation. But I can see they're improving a lot.""

In the years that followed his trip to Somaliland, Canever began to research other destinations with similar issues.

After narrowing it down to 10 independent territories with limited international recognition and six autonomous regions that were previously independent or would like to be, he started planning his extensive trip.

One of the most well known disputed countries on his hit list was Kosovo, which lies in the Balkans region of Europe.

While Somaliland has suffered from a lack of allies, Kosovo has benefited from its many supporters.

Since formally declaring independence from Serbia in 2008, with the backing of Russia, it's been recognized as an independent state by more than 100 countries, as well as the International Olympic Committee, but UN member status has eluded the territory.

Unlike some of the other disputed countries, Kosovo attracts a large number of tourists, with the majority of foreign visitors coming from Albania, Turkey and Germany.

""Kosovo has the support of a lot of wealthy countries and many tourists come here,"" says Canever.

In 2018, the number of international visitors to the partially recognized state increased by 19% over the previous year.

""You can see it's developing, but there are a lot of small problems that still need to be resolved before they can become fully independent,"" he adds.

Pain of division

Northern Cyprus isn't recognized as an independent country by any other country but Turkey. Guilherme Canever

Canever used global homestay and social networking service Couchsurfing during his trip in order to connect with locals and gain a deeper understanding of what it's like to be from a place that's existence is questioned.

""One of the things I liked most about traveling to these [unrecognized] countries is that the interactions with the locals is very unique,"" he says.

""It doesn't feel like they're providing a service to a tourist. The tourist really becomes part of the community.

""They open up their houses to you and allow you to take part in activities with them.""

He believes this is due to a combination of genuine friendliness and curiosity.

""If it's a place that not many tourists go to, sometimes they are curious and want to know how the rest of the world sees them.

""Most of these countries are very proud. Some of the people believe they're better off than those in the outside world.""

During his trip to Cyprus, which has been divided since the Turkish military invasion in 1974 backed by the Greek government, Canever witnessed first hand the level of pain this bitter separation has caused.

While Turkey recognizes the area that comprises the northeastern part of the island as the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, to the rest of the world it's the Turkish-occupied territory of the Republic of Cyprus.

""As soon as you cross the border, you can see the difference,"" Canever says of his trip to Northern Cyprus.

""I stayed with a man who told me his father was born in Turkey and his mother is Turkish Cypriot.

""He could not cross to the southern part of the island because he is considered Turkish, not Turkish Cypriot. It was really difficult for him.

""It's very hard for the younger generation.""

Proud citizens

Canever also spent time in Tibet, the remote territory known as the ""roof of the world."" Guilherme Canever

Abkhazia and South Ossetia, the two disputed territories in the Caucasus, were also on his itinerary.

The former, a breakaway region of Georgia with strong ties to Russia, left a particularly strong impression on Canever.

""Abkhazia is a beautiful place,"" he says of the region, which is bordered by over 200 kilometers of Black Sea coastline. ""It has lots of beautiful monasteries.

""It's not what you'd expect of a country that doesn't exist. A lot of Russians go there during the summer for the beaches.

""They have quite a big tourist industry. You can buy souvenirs like fridge magnets and T-shirts there.""

However, the process of entering the self-declared sovereign state was far from simple.

""You have to contact them by email [for an entry permit ] and they give you a set day for when you can go in [to get authorization],"" he explains.

""Then as soon as you enter the country, you have go to the the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to collect an official visa.""

According to Canever, the people of Abkhazia didn't seem particularly concerned with being recognized internationally.

""They were very, very nationalistic,"" he explains. ""They got very emotional [when they talked about the country]. They would say that, as Russia supports them, they didn't need the recognition of Europe or the US.""

Over in the South Caucasus lies Nagorno-Karabakh -- also known as the Republic of Artsakh. Like various other disputed countries, Nagorno-Karabakh is at the center of a long-running conflict between two nations. In this case, it's Armenia and Azerbaijan.

""Stepanakert [the capital of Nagorno-Karabakh] is easy to go to from Armenia,"" Canever says. ""It's very peaceful. There are pretty squares surrounded by flowers where people sit and have drinks.

""But the line of conflict is just a few kilometers away. Sometimes there are still exchanges of gunfire, so there's a lot of tension.""

The area is home to a number of pretty churches and monasteries, such as the Gandzasar Monastery.

""There are also beautiful mountains and a lot of places you can visit safely,"" adds Canever.

South Ossetia, a mountainous territory between Georgia and Russia that's officially part of the former, is seemingly less of a tourist draw.

""Not many people go there,"" he says.

Canever also visited Transnistria, based between Moldova and Ukraine, which declared its independence in 1990, a year before the fall of the Soviet Union.

Official recognition beckoning?

Western Sahara -- a non-self-governing territory. Guilherme Canever

But despite having its own currency and border controls, the territory is yet to be recognized by the UN. Canever was able to access the country via Moldova.

""To travel there you have to change your money into Transnistrian ruble,"" he says, explaining he was initially skeptical of how efficient things would be here.

""Pretty much all of its institutions work. I even tried to check how well they work buying a postcard and sending it home to see if it would arrive, and it did.

""It was quite interesting to see that some of these places do have full control of their territory.""

Although South Sudan became the newest recognized country in the world in 2011, there's been little to suggest any of the other aspiring countries will be granted that same privilege any time soon.

While he certainly doesn't claim to be an expert on boundary disputes, Canever says his experiences and the extensive research undertaken while writing the book have shown him that creating new border lines and countries aren't necessarily the best way to solve problems in lands.

""Most of these countries began as minorities that were having problems and wanted to be independent,"" he explains.

""But as soon as they get their independence, they become the majority, and there are still minorities in their land that need to be protected.",2020-07-12,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/visit-country-that-doesnt-exist/index.html
Maggie Hiufu Wong,Japan debuts new bullet train that can run during an earthquake,"(CNN) — Japan's latest record-breaking bullet train doesn't only run faster and smoother -- it's also able to transport passengers to safety in the event of an earthquake.

The N700S -- the 'S' stands for 'Supreme' -- entered into service July 1 and serves the Tokaido Shinkansen line, which links Tokyo Station and Shin-Osaka Station in Osaka.

It can run up to 360 kilometers per hour, a new record set during a test run in 2019, making it one of the fastest trains in the world. The operating speed, however, will be capped at 285 kilometers per hour.

It's the first new bullet train model to be added to the Tokaido Shinkansen line by the Central Japan Railway (JR Central) in 13 years, a launch that was originally timed to coincide with the Tokyo Olympics in 2020 -- now postponed to 2021

Coincidentally, Japan inaugurated the Tokaido Shinkansen line in 1964, connecting Tokyo and Osaka, just in time for the Summer Olympics in Tokyo that same year. It was the world's first high speed railway line.

Cutting-edge technology

Appearance-wise, the N700S doesn't look too different from the older N700 or N700A models, apart from its elegant golden logo.

But look closer and you'll see the brand-new train has a more angular nose, chubbier ""cheeks"" and sleeker headlight design.

On the inside, newly designed seats allow passengers to recline further, offering more comfort, especially for long-haul riders. Each seat has an individual power outlet.

Interior lighting has been designed to create a softer, more relaxing atmosphere. The overhead baggage racks will be lit up at each stop to remind passengers of their belongings.

More reservation-only storage areas for extra-large luggage have been added to this model as well.

The actual ride will be a lot quieter and smoother, too, thanks to a new active suspension system that helps absorb train movements.

In addition to a focus on increased comfort, designers behind the new model put great emphasis on safety.

The train has an upgraded automatic control and braking system that allows it to halt faster in case of an emergency.

It's also fitted with lithium-ion battery self-propulsion system -- the first of its kind in the world. This system allows the train to run for a short distance on its own during a power outage and will make it possible for it to move to a safer location at low speed if stranded in a high-risk area -- on a bridge or in a tunnel, for example -- during an earthquake.

More cameras have also been installed inside car compartments -- an increase from two cameras to up to six in each train car.

The upgraded components will take up less space under the train floor compared to the old model, making it possible for a more flexible configuration, from four to 16 cars. This also decreases energy consumption while speeding up production times, making it a more appealing option for operators internationally.

""By making the mechanisms under the floor of the N700S lighter and more compact, we created a new standard,"" Masayuki Ueno, deputy head of JR Central's bullet train business department, told Japanese broadcaster NHK in an interview in 2019",2020-07-12,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/japan-new-shinkansen-model-n700s/index.html
Nathan Kay,Lake Balaton and the endless summers of Hungary's communist riviera,"(CNN) — During the communist era, travel options were limited in Hungary and Central Europe, which meant Lake Balaton became the region's most popular vacation destination.

Now, with the world gripped by the coronavirus pandemic, this large lake in western Hungary has once again become a popular holiday spot for people from all over Europe.

Lake Balaton means as much to Hungarians as the Riviera does to Westerners. Its popularity in recent years has skyrocketed, earning itself the nickname ""The Hamptons of Hungary,"" a nod to the summer retreats on Long Island favored by wealthy New Yorkers.

The freshwater oasis is home to a picturesque 197-kilometer shoreline with public and private beaches, underwater cave galleries, volcanic hills, ancient fortresses and even a villa named after Fidel Castro.

Siófok, on the southern bank, provides an array of bars and clubs for the younger crowd while the north shore is a little more sophisticated, with spas, vineyards and historic towns.

Back in communist times, Lake Balaton was quite a different place but still maintained a cool, elegant vibe which even now evokes vivid memories for Hungarians of all ages. It also offered a rare meeting place for East and West German families divided by the Iron Curtain.

Trade union travel

Mária Dudás, 93, a retired teacher from Bernecebaráti, Hungary, has fond memories of her trips to Balaton which stretch right back to the beginning of the communist era.

She recalls that the visitors she encountered at the lake were almost exclusively the families of Hungarian trade unions, who were entitled to two weeks' vacation.

""The trade union gave us a list of which resorts had free rooms and people could choose where they wanted to go,"" she says. ""It cost just 250 forints (80 cents) per person for two weeks, which was unbelievably cheap even then.

""We had three meals per day in the restaurant, but the resort assigned seating. We couldn't just sit where we wanted.""

Dudás's granddaughter Luca tells quite a different story.

""When I hear the stories from my grandparents and think of how it is today, it really hits home how wonderful a place it is with endless opportunities for all generations, at all times,"" she says.

""My grandmother told me that they had some nights out, with music and dance; and the families they clicked with became friends that met every year. There wasn't a great deal to do, but it was their holiday time and they really enjoyed it.

""We have parties now, but our options are more varied. You can go to a party in Siófok, dance at the pop music or techno festivals in Zamárdi, learn about its history at Festetics Castle in Keszthely, taste wine in Badacsony, harvest lavender in Tihany or take out a sailing boat at Balatonfüred.""

The best-kept secret

Dudás tells CNN Travel that the best-kept secret in Lake Balaton was the Communist party resort in Balatonaliga -- Club Aliga. The resort compound was closed to the public until the regime change in 1989 as the Soviet-backed Eastern Bloc collapsed.

""It became the party resort in 1948 and had two areas, one for party members and workers and the other for the MSZMP Party,"" she said, referring to the Hungarian Socialist Workers Party.

She reels off a list of high-ranking foreign guests, including former Soviet leaders Nikita Khrushchev and Leonid Brezhnev, cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, East German leader Erich Honecker and Fidel Castro, who later gave his name to the resort's Villa Castro.

Today, Club Aliga is going through extensive renovation works and up until recently was a popular retro nightclub. From the porch, there's a wonderful panorama of Lake Balaton, from where you can see the body of water's entire eastern basin from Balatonkenese to Tihany.

Party time

György Szilágyi, 64, a property investor from Budapest, was born during the onset of the communist era in 1956. It was all he knew up until the regime change in 1989. He has nothing but fond memories of his time at the lake.

""I knew that every few years it was 'Balaton time' and it was going to be fun,"" he says. ""It was almost like a privilege.

""If you didn't have a friend or relative living there, you could count on your employer, which, in most cases, was practically the state.

""State-sponsored companies had built those typical concrete blockhouses and resort complexes that still stand witness to the communist era. The whole thing was so organized, you would be surprised.""

From the 1950s through to the 1980s, Lake Balaton was also extremely popular with German families and friends divided by the Berlin Wall. Due to this long and respected tradition, Germans still make up the main visitor numbers to the lake each year.

""It was full of Germans! It probably still is,"" says Szilágyi. ""They really seemed to love the place. It was a lot more affordable than it is now. Also, it was much more laid back, the atmosphere was somewhat more relaxed.""

Szilágyi recalls the cars of the communist era that would fill the roads leading up to Balaton.

Szilágyi's son Peter, with his tongue out, enjoys the Balaton Sound festival with friends. Courtesy Peter and György Szilágyi

""Picture this: The coast would be studded with old Wartburgs, Ladas and Trabants,"" he says. ""Maybe you'd see some nice Mercedes even. Those, of course, belonged to the West Germans, who came to hang out with their East German friends and family on the coast, effectively turning the 'Hungarian Sea' into the only possible meet-up location between the two worlds,"" he says.

""On the beach, most Hungarians would be eating what they brought from home, while those more fortunate would buy some lángos [Hungarian fried bread], corn on the cob or ice cream sticks.

""In the background, you might hear some Hungária [a Hungarian pop band] coming from an oddly colored VW Transporter. And you are there with your friends and family, doing the only thing you came here to do: sit back and enjoy the sun,"" he reminisces.

""Generally, and don't mistake me for a faithful communist for saying this, people seemed to have a lot more fun back in the old days.""

Szilágyi's son Peter, 27, also from Budapest, disagrees. He says that there are plenty of good times to be had at the lake today and parties are plenty, a standout being the Balaton Sound music festival.

""I think we have more fun now,"" he says. ""Balaton Sound is great! Take the classic Sziget Festival vibe, stir in some of the biggest names in contemporary electronic music, then place this mix on the coast of Lake Balaton -- that's how I could best describe the Balaton Sound feeling to someone who hasn't attended before.""

Peter also had fond childhood memories of summer vacations at the lake.

""We used to come together with the wider family circle near Balatonöszöd, in one of my aunties' vacation home,"" he says. ""This was the time of year when I got to spend a whole week with my cousins who lived far away.

""Typically, we used to wake up early, around 7 a.m. or so, and head to the beach to secure one of the few shady spots under the trees. Us kids always had loads of fun, but this was also a great opportunity to reconnect with our family.""

The change

Magdi Dorogi, 66, a retired secretary from Budapest, was one of the lucky few who were able to visit Lake Balaton as a child, an annual tradition that continued right up until what locals call ""the change,"" when communism ended and the resorts started to cater for international visitors.

""As a young adult, I first visited the southern shore of Lake Balaton in 1971, in Balatonlelle,"" she says. ""We went there with our friends and later my husband, in his first Zsiguli [a Soviet car brand]. We loved it because of its relaxed mood and vibe.""

Dorogi and her unmarried colleagues from Hungary's Quality Shoe Factory sidestepped rules that reserved Balaton breaks for families by bunking up with families who rented out spare rooms in their allotted accommodation to supplement incomes.

Days on the beach were followed by dinner and socializing in the evenings.

""At around 5 p.m. we went back to our accommodation, put ourselves in order, and then we went out to eat,"" she says.

""There was no mention of any expensive places. There was a 'thatched' dining room in Balatonlelle where we ate fish soup and several kinds of fried fish, then rinsed it down with a Balaton light beer.""

Lake Balaton meant a lot to Hungarians, but in the '60s and '70s, it belonged mainly to the people of Budapest. During these times, few companies had resorts on Lake Balaton, but it slowly started to open to a wider Hungary and then to international visitors during the 1980s.

""It has changed a lot over the years. A lot of nice hotels have now been built and it's become very popular,"" Dorogi adds. ""The northern shore is known as the so-called elite part while the south shore is cheaper and has a different vibe.""

Zoltán Molnár, 48, a successful entrepreneur from Budapest, says Lake Balaton is a love affair that starts in childhood and continues right through to the present day.

""As you grow you realize that it offers much more than just the water. Endless possibilities. Wine, food, culture,"" he says.

""My whole family has really fond memories of spending time at the lake in the '70s and '80s. It was such a great time for Hungarians during that era,"" he adds. ""We used to go to the lake for most of the summer each year and meet up with family and friends. These were taken at the tail end of the communist era, when everything started to change.""

""Lake Balaton is really starting to develop now. There are lots of opportunities for investment -- in property and business. It's also becoming a top European vacation destination once again and lots of people are visiting from all over the world. It's an exciting time for the people of Hungary!""

The 80 kilometer-long lake offers something for everyone -- it might sound like a cliché but happens to be true. The shallow waters on Balaton's south side draw family vacationers to the beaches while the Blue Ribbon Grand Prix sailing regatta, ongoing since 1936, attracts more than 500 boats annually and thousands of spectators to the northern shores.

The Balaton Sound music festival is one of Europe's largest open-air music events, which draws large crowds each summer -- although not this year.

There are also party boats, bungee jumping, and other activities.

VeszprémFest, also postponed until 2021, typically draws big-name performers and crowds in the summer. The Valley of Arts festival in Kapolcs is held at the end of July while the Paloznak Jazz picnic is also a big draw each year.

The hills atop Lake Balaton's north shore are home to many of Hungary's prime vineyards. Somló and Badacsony stand out with unique volcanic soils that help create bold and full-bodied whites. Balatonfüred produces a delicious Szürkebarát (like a Pinot Noir), and other regions produce world-beating wines that are used in the finest restaurants across the country.

The future

With travel habits now changing for people all over the world, local hotspots like Balaton have once again become thriving regional holiday destinations.

Large numbers descend upon the lake to take advantage of the water sports activities and to sunbathe on the beautifully kept beaches.

Outside of the water, Balaton is fast becoming a major music and arts attraction and is now Hungary's second-most important food and wine region after Budapest.

Lake Balaton is becoming so popular that the Hungarian government recently allocated $21 million for the modernization of the lake and its surrounding areas. The nearby Hévíz--Balaton Airport is currently in development to handle international flights, and new roads and railways are also being introduced.

Following the coronavirus crisis, even more money has been allocated to boost tourism and to encourage the people of the region to experience homegrown resorts. Various taxes have also been reduced to help the industry grow and prosper in these difficult times.",2020-07-12,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/hungary-lake-balaton-communist-riviera/index.html
Amani Al-Aidroos,EcoLoo: How a poop on Everest inspired a new type of toilet,"(CNN) How many of us have our best ideas on the toilet?

No really, it can happen. Take Zuraina Zaharin from Malaysia. She's built a business off the back of a loo break. Not just any loo break, of course. This one was near Everest in the early 2000s when she was climbing in the region -- and it was pretty bleak.

""I was facing this problem: the toilet,"" she explains. ""It's easy for men to do their business; they can just do it anywhere. But not for the ladies. We have to wait until we find some nice spot. Even then, I can't do it. I just have to find the toilet.""

Things didn't improve upon discovering the facilities, however. ""The last toilet at Everest base camp is a pit latrine,"" Zaharin continues. ""The smell, God knows... it's so stinky.""

Zaharin had traveled to the Himalayas, only to encounter ""a mountain of poop.""

Nathan Sing,The world through the eyes of one photographer,"(CNN) — Whether traveling through the vast floodplains of Africa or Thailand's lush mangrove forests, when photographer Michael Poliza explores the world, he practices one principle: take nothing but pictures and leave nothing but footprints.

Over the last two decades, Poliza has traveled to almost 180 countries to capture vibrant and spirited photos focused on intimate moments of animals and the world's least-documented landscapes.

Capturing these special moments requires patience and an understanding of the erratic rhythms of the wilderness, but even the most seasoned wildlife photographers are not immune to nature's whims.

One day in 2011, while soaring over Purnululu National Park in Western Australia, Poliza and his helicopter pilot were too absorbed by the beauty of its beehive-like rock formations to notice they were headed straight towards a storm.

""Lightning was coming down left and right and up and down, and I had an open door in the back of the helicopter which you cannot close, so the rain was coming in. It was pitch black,"" said Poliza.

It was, he remembers, a ""scary afternoon,"" but not a wasted one. As documented in his latest book ""The World,"" the combination of imposing edifices and bottled lightning is among his most stunning photography to date.

These beehive-like rock formations found in Purnululu National Park, Western Australia, are known as the ""bungle bungles."" Photo © 2019 Michael Poliza. All rights reserved.

A man of reinvention

Poliza, now 62, wasn't always a photographer, starting as a child actor in his hometown of Hamburg, Germany, before founding multiple IT companies in the early internet boom. But in 1997, after more than a decade of transatlantic business trips, he sold his companies, packed up his things, and set out to explore the world.

He bought a 75-foot boat and embarked on a 1,009-day expedition around the world to raise environmental awareness, with photographers and filmmakers in tow. Together, they documented the journey, broadcasting photos via satellite and online as they explored remote areas of the world only reachable by ship.

During the trip, while searching for great white sharks in Australia, Poliza learned to appreciate that nature cannot be forced. After five days without a sighting, a friend of Poliza's was getting impatient and offered money to their guide to speed up the search. ""There was nothing he could do ... that was a very good lesson to understand that you cannot push nature to do anything.""

A new beginning

When his journey came to an end, Poliza, then in his mid-40s, was confronted with what to do next. He sold his ship and stopped in Cape Town, South Africa, on the way to Madagascar. Besotted, Poliza canceled his trip to Madagascar, bought a house in Cape Town, and began exploring the continent.

He joined his friends on safaris, capturing photos of Africa's spectacular landscapes and vast range of animals. When some of his photographs began appearing in advertisements, his career started to take off. ""I was just playing with my camera and trying to shoot things a bit different,"" said Poliza.

""To be honest, I didn't really have a plan ... I didn't wake up in the morning and say, 'I want to take a photo of wildlife or landscapes or a specific animal,' it just drifted into that.""

One day, after returning from a safari, Poliza realized he had a problem. ""I opened up my mail (and) I saw that my bank account wasn't smiling at me anymore. I realized I need to come up with a plan.""

He quickly found a publisher for his first book ""Africa,"" released in 2006, which gained worldwide attention. Poliza's photographs have filled a further 11 books, selling thousands of copies. His latest, "" The World ,"" published by teNeues , is the culmination of his work from the last decade.

""I realized that I had a lot of images that hadn't been used ... so I thought maybe it would be fun to do a book that is a subjective look at the world,"" Poliza said. ""I don't attempt to, and I don't pretend that my set of images covers the whole world. It's just my view of the world.""

No matter where he is, Poliza says it's imperative for him to travel light, support the local economy, and live among the locals. He has formed an emotional attachment to the landscapes, the wildlife, and the people of every place he has traveled to. As the effects of global climate change worsen, he hopes his photos inspire others to commit to saving the planet.

""What I'm trying to do is focus on the beautiful side of the world, and I think there's still a lot of beauty there,"" he says. ""I want people to ... create an emotional reaction with that area, with that place, with our planet, and are more willing to take responsibility that way.""",2020-07-12,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/michael-poliza-photographer-modern-explorers-intl/index.html
Sandee Lamotte,Meet the country that passes no law unless it improves citizens' well being,"(CNN) On the eastern edge of the Himalayas, nestled between India and Tibet, lies the tiny nation of Druk Yul, better known as Bhutan. In Bhutanese, the name means ""Land of the Thunder Dragon,"" a nod to the violent storms that pound the rugged mountain peaks and flood the lush valleys.

Bhutan is known as ""the last Shangri-La"" -- a remote Himalayan nation, rich in natural beauty and Buddhist culture, where national happiness is prioritized over economic growth.

Fiercely proud and protective of its traditions, Bhutan has been closed to outside influences for centuries. The nation only opened its doors to tourism in the 1970s and has decided to take a unique approach to westernization, creating a concept known as the ""Gross National Happiness Index.""

Don't be fooled by the name. This is not just a measure of how much people smile and laugh. It's a holistic approach to sustainable development that gives as much weight to human flourishing as it does wealth.

""We in Bhutan are very unique; our democracy is very, very unique ... in the sense we all are grounded very strongly by our national values,"" said Bhutan Prime Minister Dr. Lotay Tshering, who took office in November 2018. ""We do not put personal interest ahead of national interest.

""When we say Gross National Happiness, it is not the celebrative 'Ha ha -- Ho ho' kind of happiness that we look for in life,"" Lotay explained. ""It only means contentment, control of your mind, control of wants in your life. Don't be jealous with others, be happy with what you have, be compassionate, be a society where you can be more than happy to share.

""Our king rightly calls Gross National Happiness as development with values,"" Lotay continues. ""If the policy does not have a good amount of happiness index, if the policy is not every environment friendly, if the policy will not be able to ensure that it will result in the well-being of Bhutanese, that policy will never be approved in the country.""

Gross National Happiness

The Centre for Bhutan and GNH Studies is responsible for administering Bhutan's Gross National Happiness surveys. They ask questions such as ""How happy did you feel yesterday?"" and ""How often do you practice meditation?""

They measure nine key areas of happiness every five years -- psychological well-being, health, education, good governance, ecology, time use, community vitality, culture and living standards. Two surveys have been conducted so far, in 2010 and 2015, with another one due next year.

The house of a working farm sits in a valley nestled in the mountains near the eastern Bhutanese town of Paro.

The 2015 survey sampled more than 7,000 Bhutanese from across the country. It yielded some interesting results.

""The harder components like living standard, health, access to health or access to education and so on, they're improving in Bhutan,"" said Tshoki Zangmo, a researcher at the Centre.

""But the softer components like psychological well-being or the trust indicator that we have in our community vitality domain, those were deteriorating,"" she added. ""The trust indicator within urban areas in the country, they were deteriorating.""

95th out of 156 countries in the That's right. Bhutan is not the happiest country in the world. It actually ranks95th out of 156 countriesin the 2019 World Happiness Report. Much of that has to do with the nation's poverty, and the challenges of bringing economic and social equity to a predominately agricultural society.

Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.

Much of the rural population relies on subsistence farming in a high-mountain environment that is vulnerable to climate change. Rugged terrain, frequent floods and landslides hinder development; urban-rural connectivity is poor. Television was only introduced in 1999 and there are still no traffic lights in the capital city.

""There's another misunderstanding ... that Bhutan has claimed that we're the happiest country,"" said Tshoki. ""I don't think we're the happiest country.

""But what sets Bhutan apart from the other countries is that our vision is clear,"" she added. ""Our vision is to reach a state where societies have all the enabling conditions intact, not only the economic aspects but the other aspects as well, such as the environment, the community, having access to health and education and so on.""

Dr. Prime Minister

One only needs to follow 50-year-old Lotay to see the Bhutanese way in action. He exercises daily, but one day is special. Every Thursday he steadily pedals up a steep hill outside Thimphu, Bhutan's capital city. His goal is the 169-foot-tall Buddha Dordenma statue, one of the largest in the world. His mission is two-fold: exercise to strengthen his body, and prayer and meditation to strengthen his mind.

Prime Minister Dr. Lotay Tshering prays outside of Buddha Dordenma.

""When we say stronger, it just does not mean the muscle strength,"" Lotay says. ""It means the mental strength, the strength of your neurons. So those are the ingredients to help your neurons to be very strong.""

After his bike ride, the Prime Minister makes his way to the hospital for rounds. As a urologist and surgeon for more than 20 years, being a doctor is an integral part of what makes him happy. Therefore, he makes time on Thursdays and Saturdays to pursue his passion, which just happens to reflect his values.

""Since I come from a traditional family, I always thought we should help others,"" Lotay says. ""I thought being religious is the way forward, so on that note I really wanted to be a monk. My mother said why not be a doctor so that you can be really of help to the needy ones and so ... I decided to be a doctor.""

As he makes his hospital rounds with residents and interns, Lotay tries to instill the same values he has practiced, values he says he tries to bring to how he approaches two of Bhutan's top goals: universal healthcare and education.

""Health and education are the most powerful social levelers,"" the Prime Minister says. ""So based on that, we have free health and free education in our country. While it is free, it is not easily accessible, easily available for everyone that needs the service.

Tshering visits with a patient on hospital rounds.

""I thought we could improve the accessibility of health care services to especially the needy ones, those who are based in the villages,"" he said, adding that ""this pair of hands can only do so much. A surgical blade can only operate a patient at a time.

""I joined politics to see mainly if I can bring in some policy changes,"" he added, ""so that with the stroke of my surgical blade, I treat one patient. With the stroke of a pen I can treat the whole nation.""

Bhutan's future

The country may not rank highest in happiness, yet, but it has made major gains. Thousand of kilometers of roads have been constructed and phone lines installed. Run-of-the-river hydroelectricity accounts for the largest share of its economy.

Water flows through tunnels at the site of the Punatsangchhu hydro-electric power project in Wangdue, Bhutan.

The World Bank calls Bhutan a developmental success story, with decreasing levels of extreme poverty and improvements in gender equality, as well as a stable political and economic environment.

""Just over the last three to four decades our life expectancy at birth has increased from near 50 to over 70,"" said Lotay. ""With modernization, with decent access to good health care, more nutritious food and health awareness being better day by day, so many Bhutanese now live longer.""

Bhutan places a tight control on tourism, including visits to the Tiger's Nest, a sacred Buddhist site on a cliffside.

Due to the country's natural beauty and native culture, ecotourism is huge. To manage it within the country's Gross National Happiness mandate, Bhutan imposes an ecotourism tax of $250 a day per person, which they use to offset the environmental impact of thousands of visitors. It's been so successful that Bhutan says it's not only carbon-neutral, it's carbon-negative.

The country has long partnered with the World Wildlife Fund to protect native wildlife in numerous parks. Plastic bags have been banned since 1999. Tobacco has been banned since 2005, making Bhutan the world's first smoke-free nation. The Bhutanese constitution mandates that at least 60% of the country remain under forest cover. Right now, said Lotay, they are at 70%.

Despite the need for economic growth, the Prime Minister is confident those priorities will not change for the Bhutanese people.

""When we know that monetary wealth and material wealth will not translate to what you actually want in your life ... peace of mind and happiness ... then why should we target that as our main objective?

""We have to think about the next generations to come,"" he added. ""So, these are the values of Gross National Happiness that we practice. That's why economically we may not be doing very well because all those checks and balances will ensure that whatever we initiate will be sustainable, will be for generations to come.""",2019-09-13,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/09/13/health/bhutan-gross-national-happiness-wellness/index.html
Allie Torgan,"From rock superstar to all-star dishwasher, Jon Bon Jovi is keeping his community fed","(CNN) When rock band Bon Jovi canceled its summer tour due to the global pandemic, front man Jon Bon Jovi didn't waste a beat turning his focus to those in need in his own backyard.

At his JBJ Soul Kitchen , a non-profit community restaurant in New Jersey, diners pay a cash donation that covers their meal and a meal for someone in need.

But amid earlier Covid-19 restrictions, the restaurant -- run by the Jon Bon Jovi Soul Foundation -- could only remain open for takeout.

Without its regular in-house volunteer base, the kitchen kept operations afloat with the help of the rock star dishwasher.

""There's an in-need population here in New Jersey who depend on us,"" Bon Jovi told CNN in April. ""Hence, the All-Star Hall of Fame dishwasher is back in business.""

Bon Jovi helped out five days a week until just recently, when the restaurant entered phase two and began seating customers per new guidelines.

Over its 13-week takeout period, the restaurant provided more than 7,800 to-go meals to individuals, families, community partners and frontline workers.

At one point, Bon Jovi's wife, Dorothea, took a picture of him washing dishes for social media. It was captioned, ""Do what you can.""

The caption inspired him to pen a song and ask fans around the world to do their part as well.

""The songwriter in me came out, and I wrote the song 'If You Can't Do What You Do, You Do What You Can,'"" he said. ""I knew that people from all walks of life would have their stories to tell, so I invited them to write me a verse.""

From lyrics about missed graduations, fears, togetherness and health, Bon Jovi has been able to hear from and share experiences of fans and musicians around the world.

""It's a great opportunity for me to stay in touch with people around the world and just let them know that I'm thinking of them,"" he said. ""It's a reminder that, even if you can't do what you do, you do what you can.""

Now, as New Jersey enters stage two of its reopening plan, JBJ Soul Kitchen has transitioned back to its pay-it-forward model, continuing to serve delicious meals with dignity.

""Our desire is to make sure that anyone who needs a meal knows that they can come and see us,"" Bon Jovi said, ""and we'll provide them with that nutritious meal.""",2020-07-09,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/09/us/bon-jovi-new-jersey-meals-pandemic-cnnheroes/index.html
Nectar Gan,July 11 coronavirus news,"Opened in 1888, Katz's Deli is located on Houston Street in New York's Lower East Side.

For the first time in its 132-year history, Katz's Delicatessen is adding outdoor seating in response to the Covid-19 pandemic.

A New York City staple famous for its pastrami sandwiches, Katz's is known for its aisles of seats indoors. The deli had to innovate to comply or continue serving guests solely through take-out and delivery.

Jake Dell, the fifth-generation owner of Katz's, told CNN Saturday his business has been among the lucky ones throughout the pandemic, keeping all of its staff and their standard hours of work despite schedule changes.

""For some of our customers, doing take out isn't enough,"" Dell said. ""For many, take-out or delivery isn't what they're used to; they grab it on the way home from work or take it home for lunch, eat in the car. Unfortunately for others, that isn't the case. I think being able to provide a service, sitting down to eat, is an amazing opportunity to have and we're immediately thankful for.""

Katz's is adding seating capacity for between 50 and 70 people at a time on the sidewalk and street around the restaurant on Manhattan's Lower East Side, Dell said. The restaurant went through a trial period last week and is now operating with its outside seating until further notice.

Operating since 1888, non-New Yorkers may know the deli as the location of the famous ""I'll have what she's having"" scene in the 1989 romantic comedy, ""When Harry Met Sally.""

Mary Ilyushina,The Russian whistleblower risking it all to expose the scale of an Arctic oil spill catastrophe,"Norilsk, Russia (CNN) Vasily Ryabinin stands on the banks of the River Daldykan and pushes a long stick into the blood-orange sludge. Raising the stick, he puts a lighter to it and it ignites it like a torch.

""Still burns really well,"" Ryabinin says. ""It's very likely that these puddles are stretching all over the river and will be polluting it for a very long time.""

We were a few kilometers from the Siberian city of Norilsk , where six weeks ago a huge fuel tank at a power plant ruptured, spilling thousands of tons of diesel into the river.

The owner of the plant, the Nornickel metals giant, says the spill was quickly contained, and the damage limited. Ryabinin has sacrificed his job and his family's future in Norilsk in an attempt to lift the lid on what environmentalists have called the worst ecological catastrophe in the polar Arctic.

It was 2 a.m. in the Arctic summer. A half-light illuminated the fast-moving river as it flowed through the endless tundra towards the Arctic ocean. A rainbow film of oil covered the surface; a pool of diesel squelched beneath our feet.

Ryabinin brought us there by foot along railroad tracks. Ever since the spill, the areas surrounding the site have been guarded by security personnel, making them difficult to access.

He is a rare creature in today's Russia -- a whistleblower who quit his job with the state environmental agency Rosprirodnadzor and went public about the extent of the disaster.

Ryabinin says he was first alerted to the scale of the crisis on May 29 by photographs posted on Instagram. He was immediately alarmed: the Daldykan and another river polluted by the spill flow into Lake Pyasino. From there, the contamination could spread all the way to the Arctic Ocean.

Vasily Ryabinin

Just a few hours later he was at the river, taking photographs that would soon provoke a public outcry. He and his boss tried to get in to the Nornickel plant, but he says they were refused entry by police.

More than 20,000 tons of diesel poured into the rivers from the storage tank, according to Nornickel.

Foaming red sludge mixed with the water and sucked life from the rivers and their banks.

""It looked horrible when we got there and it wasn't even the worst of it as a couple of hours had passed,"" Ryabinin says. ""You could smell the diesel half a kilometer away... my boss was even afraid to smoke there in case it blew up.""

What he saw was very different from what officials and media were later reporting: that the spill had swiftly been brought under control. Russian state TV ran reports showing aerial pictures of oil-spill booms guarding the crimson layer of diesel.

""It was such an obvious, childish lie, I couldn't wrap my head around it,"" Ryabinin told CNN.

""Obviously I thought we must at least investigate the lake but my [agency] had a different view, which corresponded with the one of the [Nornickel] plant — that the spill did not spread further that the river.""

Ryabinin says the last straw for him was when Rosprirodnadzor told him to stop looking into the disaster after he had found a helicopter to fly to the lake. At that point, on June 7, he went public, recording a 45-minute account of what he'd found -- concluding that the volume of fuel and speed of the stream must have spread the contamination further.

Rosprirodnadzor did not respond to CNN's request for comment. In an email, Nornickel told CNN that the cleanup of the spill was ongoing, and that the company was ""guided by the official data of Rosprirodnadzor and the Ministry of Emergency Situations,"" as well as satellite imagery that shows ""the borders of the fuel spread.""

A sample collected by Ryabinin on the day of the spill.

A layer of gasoline visible on the surface of the Daldykan River.

Back in Moscow, YouTube blogger and environmentalist Georgy Kavanosyan made the same calculation as Ryabinin.

""All you needed to do is look at the satellite imagery, establish the area of ​​this red spot and divide it by the thousands of tons we were told poured into the water,"" Kavanosyan says. ""And you'd get that the diesel would have to run 50 meters thick to stop there — so that's clearly impossible.""

""They only caught the very tail of this spill and no-one even mentioned what's under the film, state TV kept showing the spill saying there is allegedly nothing under it and it's just on the surface,"" Kavanosyan told CNN. ""And under this layer, hydrocarbons dissolve and infiltrate all life — fish, roe, mud, everything.""

After watching Ryabinin's video, Kavanosyan decided to travel to the region to take independent samples from Lake Pyasino -- and find out whether the pollution had reached the lake.

Norilsk is a difficult place to operate in. It's a remote 'mono-city' where one company and one industry dominate the economy -- enjoying considerable influence as a result. More than 2,800 kilometers northeast of Moscow, the city was founded during Stalin's reign as a site for gulag prisoners. There is no overland connection with the rest of Russia: to get there and back, you have to fly. Foreigners need to get special permission from the Federal Security Agency, or FSB, to get in.

Kavanosyan says he and his cameraman pretended to be on a personal visit and stayed in rented apartments, avoiding main streets. At night they snuck out to the river hoping to find a boat to take them to the lake.

""It was hard, half the people here work for Nornickel and it would've obviously been a risk for them,"" Kavanosyan says.

When they finally reached the lake, they found contamination levels of dissolved hydrocarbons 2.5 higher than officially permissible, Kavanosyan said. He was the only one who managed to take independent samples from that area.

Others were not so lucky. Journalists from Novaya Gazeta said they faced constant harassment from Nornickel guards as they investigated another area with Vasily Ryabinin, finding a place where waste water was being pumped right into the tundra. Nornickel later admitted violations at the tailing pond and suspended local staff. Russia's Investigative Committee launched an investigation into this incident.

Greenpeace Russia also spent two weeks trying to get samples from Lake Pyasino but said the authorities constantly tried to obstruct their work — a police helicopter located them in a forest hut and their boat fuel was confiscated.

A Moscow city lawmaker, who agreed to carry the samples gathered by journalists and Greenpeace activists back to the capital, says he had them confiscated at the local airport last week.

In a video posted by Novaya Gazeta, airport staff said that the airport ""is also Nornickel"" and that taking water samples out required the company's permission.

When asked to comment on these allegations, Nornickel said that ""the emergency regime has been installed at the site and access to many locations is restricted.""

This spill was by no means the first environmental disaster in this part of Siberia, some of whose rivers flow red with toxic waste from factories amid lax environmental regulations. Locals have complained about acidic gases polluting the air; the edges of Norilsk resemble a huge rusting junkyard with dead trees as far as the eye can see.

""Everything is dying here,"" said Andrey, a local driver who did not want to disclose his last name. ""People are mostly concerned about the gas, sometimes it gets so bad we don't let out kids outside.""

But this rare spotlight on the city and Nornickel has prompted the company to provide public explanations, accept full responsibility for the spill and accept the cost of the clean-up. Last week it said that over 90% of fuel from the spill had been collected.

In its preliminary assessment the company blamed melting permafrost for affecting the fuel tank's foundations but said an investigation was still ongoing.

Arctic Russia is indeed warming, and a melting permafrost is potentially devastating for infrastructure in the region. More than 60% of the country's vast land surface is underlain by permafrost . This summer in Norilsk has also been abnormally hot.

But both Kavanosyan and Ryabinin doubt that the tank's sudden collapse was due to climate change. They say Russia has enough experience building on ice and can artificially freeze the ground if needed. They believe it's likely that poor maintenance or lack of oversight are to blame.

A dump on the river bank next to an pre-processing plant on the outskirts of Norilsk.

The scandal, and Ryabinin's allegations, have also prompted Rostekhnadzor, a state body which oversees the maintenance of industrial infrastructure, to disclose that its specialists had not been able to gain access to the tank at the Nornickel plant for five years.

The spill has even drawn in President Vladimir Putin, who chaired a televised meeting with the head of Nornickel, Vladimir Potanin, in early June. Potanin said the company expects to pay about $140 million to cover the damages.

""One vessel that contained the fuel costs much less, incomparably less,"" Putin replied. ""I'm saying that if you had changed that one tank on time there wouldn't have been any damage to nature, and the company wouldn't have to cover such expenses.""

Beyond the rare public spotlight on an environmental issue in Russia, the Nornickel spill has provided an even rarer example of dissent and protest winning out in Russia. Weeks after the findings by Ryabinin and Kavanosyan, the state agency Rosprirodnadzor admitted that Lake Pyasino had been contaminated.

On Wednesday it estimated the damage to be 14 times greater than Nornickel's initial assessment and asked it to pay a record $2 billion in compensation.

The company disputed the assessment, saying the agency had based its calculations ""on principles that have distorted the results and need to be adjusted."" It also added that it remains committed to its obligation to eliminate the consequences of the spill at their own expense.

Kavanosyan called Rosprirodnadzor's action ""revolutionary"" and said it sent a signal to all enterprises that choose to ""dump waste into rivers and lakes and save on wastewater treatment plants.""

As for Ryabinin, he is preparing to leave Norilsk and move his family somewhere else.

""This is quite sad because I really love my city, the North and I don't want to leave,"" he said. ""But I did this knowing that I will not be able to live and work here after all of this.""",2020-07-10,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/10/europe/arctic-oil-spill-russia-whistleblower-intl/index.html

Jessie Yeung,Domestic helpers in Hong Kong: Where hundreds of thousands of women have to live with their boss,"Hong Kong (CNN) When Marta came to Hong Kong in 2011, she was a 29-year-old single mother, looking for a job that could support her young daughter and sick father back in the Philippines.

Foreign domestic workers, she knew, often earn much higher salaries than she could find at home. Before she arrived, a recruitment agency found her a job as a helper -- a job that entails being a housekeeper, personal chef, nanny and caretaker.

And like nearly all helpers in Hong Kong, she was legally required to live in her employer's home.

What she said followed were six months of physical and emotional abuse so excruciating that she broke her contract and fled. ""All my body died for him,"" says Marta, now 37, who requested a pseudonym to protect her identity. ""He is the dark in my life.""

The mistreatment Marta describes is not uncommon in Hong Kong, home to more than 390,000 helpers who largely come from the Philippines and Indonesia.

Making up nearly 10% of the city's labor force, these women -- only about 1% of helpers are men -- are integral to Hong Kong's economy and daily life. Yet they are also one of the city's most vulnerable communities.

In a survey of 5,023 helpers last year, 15% of respondents said they had been physically abused during employment. And 2% reported being sexually assaulted or harassed, according to advocacy organization Mission For Migrant Workers (MFMW), which ran the survey.

Issues of poor working and living conditions are common complaints.

Activists say the live-in rule, which is only waived by the government in exceptional circumstances, forces women to reside with potentially abusive employers with few avenues for help.

After Marta left her first employer, she said she faced periods of homelessness and unemployment -- at one point sleeping on a mattress on the floor of her church -- before finding a new job.

Now, back on her feet, she's pushing to change the live-in rule -- by taking it to court.

A quick history

Foreign domestic workers began coming to Hong Kong in the 1970s, a decade of rapid economic development that saw the city transform from a poor manufacturing hub to a financial capital with modern urban infrastructure.

Hong Kong's Security Bureau. Local women wanted to join the workforce, and opening up work visas to helpers ""relieved housewives from household chores for taking up employment,"" according to a 2005 report byHong Kong's Security Bureau.

Helpers are typically in charge of cleaning their employers' households, buying groceries, cooking meals, caring for children and the elderly, and a range of other essential tasks.

For several decades, some helpers lived with their employers while others opted to live out -- but in 2003, the authorities made the live-in rule mandatory. They claimed doing so would ""better reflect the policy intention"" behind bringing in foreign workers -- to fill a shortage in full-time, live-in domestic services, especially crucial for those who need around-the-clock care like people with disabilities or elderly residents living alone.

There's no such shortage for part-time or non live-in services, so allowing foreign workers to live-out would put them in direct competition with local workers, the government argued.

The rule dictated that employers provide ""suitable accommodation"" with ""reasonable privacy,"" but offered few other guidelines. Employers are required to disclose the size of their apartment and the type of accommodation for the helper -- for instance, a private room or a partitioned area of the home -- on the employment contract , which is then signed off by the helper.

But there are no standards or requirements for how much minimum space helpers should be given, and the vague wording of ""suitable"" means some are made to sleep in poor conditions, like in the bathroom or on the floor.

If a helper breaks the rule by living out, they face a ban from working in Hong Kong -- and the employer could be banned from hiring helpers. They could even be prosecuted for providing false information, punishable by imprisonment or a heavy fine.

No privacy, no rest

Since its introduction, the rule has attracted critics, who say it exacerbates the challenges helpers already face in their demanding roles.

For instance, Hong Kong has long struggled with limited residential space and high housing prices. Many families live in cramped apartments with barely space for their families, let alone for helpers.

In this environment, helpers often complain about long hours, a lack of privacy, and uncomfortable sleeping arrangements. There's also the risk of abuse from their employers; when that happens, leaving a job is rarely an option. Doing so would threaten their visa status, employment, and ability to support their families.

Dolores Balladares, a 50-year-old from the Philippines, arrived in Hong Kong when she was 25.

She says that in her first job, she didn't have her own room. Instead, her employer set up flimsy privacy curtains, similar to those used around hospital beds, around the sofa in the living room. At the end of her work day, Balladares would draw the curtains around herself and struggle to sleep.

Her employers and their children would still be watching television just feet away in the same room.

""It was so demeaning,"" Balladares said of that first job.

Furthermore, living in means there is no real differentiation between many helpers' workspace and personal living space: it's all the same household. Work-life boundaries can dissolve entirely, especially since there are no laws around maximum working hours per day or week.

Balladares said she often worked more than 12 hours a day, sometimes waking at 5 a.m. and not sleeping until nearly 1 a.m.

""It was a family of five, the parents were both working and the children were all studying, so I did everything,"" she said. ""From preparing breakfast to bringing the kids to the school bus, then going to the market, ironing, teaching the children their homework, cleaning the house, and doing the cooking before I sleep at night.""

Though the law mandates helpers must be given a full 24-hour rest day each week, that's often not the case. On her off days, Balladares says she would still be asked to clean the family cars before leaving to meet her friends -- and she was told to be home by 8 p.m. so she could clean dishes and help bathe the children.

In the MFMW survey, more than half of respondents said that, like Balladares, they didn't have their own rooms, and instead had ""alternative sleeping arrangements."" Often helpers share a bunk bed with one of the family's children.

More than half said they worked between 11 and 16 hours per day, while 44% said they worked more than 16 hours. Nearly half said they were asked to work during their rest days. Another 29% said they weren't given enough food, which an employer is legally required to supply, or given an allowance for it.

Choosing between safety and income

Many helpers who face these conditions, or physical and sexual abuse, are often reluctant to report it to authorities for fear of jeopardizing their livelihoods. Taking legal action would be financially and emotionally draining, and could potentially deter future employers -- not an easy risk to take when you have family members back home to support.

If helpers leave their jobs before their two-year contract is up, they have 14 days to find a new job -- or they must leave Hong Kong, unless they have ""exceptional approval,"" according to a guide by the Immigration Department.

Numerous global humanitarian organizations, including Amnesty International and the United Nations Human Rights Committee , have called on the Hong Kong government to repeal this 14-day rule, arguing it discourages helpers from leaving abusive or exploitative situations.

""The issue here is that the (live-in) rule renders them vulnerable,"" said Karen Ng, a case manager at the non-profit organization HELP for Domestic Workers. ""It's forcing the worker to choose between their safety and making an income to support their families.""

Even if helpers do speak out, they often don't have enough evidence for police to help them, Ng added -- when they live in, the only witnesses are the employers' family members.

The most notorious case of helper abuse captured the city's attention in 2015, when Hong Kong housewife Law Wan-tung was found guilty of abusing her helper, Erwiana Sulistyaningsih, a 23-year-old woman from Indonesia.

Law regularly beat Erwiana with mop handles and coat hangers, and forced her to sleep on the floor, for only five hours a night. Erwiana was only given meager rations of food, and warned that her parents would be killed if she told anyone.

Former Indonesian domestic worker Erwiana Sulistyaningsih speaks during an event in Hong Kong on March 27, 2016.

During Erwiana's trial, Law's two children, who lived in the flat during the abuse, provided no evidence against their mother. One testified that she was ""gentle"" to the helpers.

Though Law was sentenced to prison for six years, no systemic change followed.

In a report released later that year, the government said changing the live-in rule would strain the city's housing and public transit systems, and would ""go against the rationale for importing FDHs and the fundamental policy that local employees (including local domestic helpers) should enjoy priority in employment.""

A year later, Marta filed her legal challenge against the rule.

The fight to change the rule

In 2016, Marta applied for a judicial review, arguing the live-in rule was discriminatory and raised the risk of violating helpers' fundamental rights.

Helpers just want the option to live out, she and other activists argue -- and not all of them would necessarily take it. Many helpers who have good working relationships with their employers appreciate the cost-saving element of living in, which allows them to send more money home to family.

Some employers also favor having an option if they don't feel comfortable inviting a stranger to live in their home.

In such cases, some employers agree to pay for their helpers to live in illegal boarding houses, which offer shared rooms and common areas. Helpers get their own space, privacy, and more control over their working hours -- but also face heightened risk, as police occasionally conduct raids.

""I want freedom -- the freedom to choose,"" Marta said. ""Why not try to get freedom for both the employer and employee?""

But her first challenge failed. In 2018, the judge dismissed the case and upheld the rule, arguing that in instances of mistreatment, the problem was the bad employer -- not the fact the helper lived in the same household.

There was ""no sufficient evidence"" that the live-in rule significantly raised the risk of violating fundamental rights, or that the rule directly caused abuse, the judge wrote.

The government praised the dismissal, adding in a statement that helpers could ""terminate the contract any time"" if they didn't want to live with their employers.

The statement didn't mention the 14-day rule, or the fact many helpers who leave their contracts legally have to return to their home nations, before reapplying for a job and visa all over again.

The government's response sparked anger among helpers and activists.

""We should not think of domestic workers as throwaways -- 'you don't like the terms, don't come,'"" said Ng. ""They're contributing a lot toward society, so why can't we see them that way? We should take into consideration that they have rights, they have needs.""

Marta is now living with a new employer who she says treats her well, respects her working hours, and provides her with her own room. She has found a caring community in her church and is working to heal -- but says she's still fighting the rule.

She has appealed the judgment and is waiting for the court to release its decision. It's not clear when the judgment will come.

""If the employer is nice, that's fine -- but how about the helpers who have no food, no room and no rest, then no option and no freedom?"" she said.

""I am not just fighting for myself but fighting for others. I am thinking about other people -- for them to have an option.""",2020-07-09,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/09/asia/hong-kong-helper-live-in-rule-intl-hnk/index.html
Chris Isidore,The ugly truth about millions of American jobs: They are not coming back,"New York (CNN Business) The American economy's unprecedented jobs rebound masks a difficult truth: For millions of people, the jobs they lost are never coming back.

""It's clear that the pandemic is doing some fundamental damage to the job market,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody's Analytics. ""A lot of the jobs lost aren't coming back any time soon . The idea that the economy is going to snap back to where it was before the pandemic is clearly not going to happen.""

The June jobs report last week showed a net gain 4.8 million jobs, a record one-month jump, according to Labor Department data. Virtually all of the people returning to work were on temporary layoffs, such as workers in factories, stores, hotels , bars and restaurants that are reopening.

But at the same time, 759,000 people were laid off from jobs that won't be coming back. That marks the second-largest monthly increase the United States has ever seen, topped only by an 805,000 jump in January of 2009, in the depths of the Great Recession.

There's now a total of 3.7 million unemployed Americans whose previous jobs are gone for good. And millions more are at risk.

Temporary becomes permanent

More than 10 million Americans are currently categorized as temporarily out of work. But historically, nearly 30% of people who tell the Labor Department that they are temporarily unemployed never get their job back, said Heidi Shierholz, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank.

""Even though we don't know if the historical record will hold in this case, it's an extremely valid concern that not all of those people are going to get called back,"" she said.

People who are counting on businesses reopening their doors may be surprised to find that a temporary loss has become permanent one, said Zandi.

Some of those unemployed were holding temporary jobs that came to an end. The end of a temporary job would have been more likely to be replaced by a new job in the strong job market that existed just last year.

But most of those 3.7 million workers lost long-term jobs.

'This is just the beginning'

The recent spike in Covid-19 cases in different parts of the country, and the new round of stay-at-home orders and business shutdowns weren't captured in this latest jobs report, according to both Zandi and Shierholz.

""The intensification of the virus has led to a second round of closure that might be too much for many of these businesses,"" said Zandi.

The speed of the job losses is another reason for concern. The Great Recession was already more than a year old when it hit those record figures for permanent job losses. As economic problems build, economists say there will be more permanent job cuts ahead.

""This is just the beginning of the increase in permanent job losses,"" said Zandi.

The data collection problem

Boeing BA The latest government data available don't account for many workers who are still on the job but are expected to be let go. For example,announced plans to cut 16,000 workers , with 12,300 of those job cuts already being identified through buyouts or involuntary permanent layoffs . But virtually all of those affected workers are still on the job as of today.

Similarly, thousands of stores are closing permanently but still have workers in place as retailers hold closing sales

And deep financial problems at state and local governments, most of which began a new fiscal year last week, are expected to lead to millions of additional permanent job cuts in the coming weeks and months unless Congress agrees to new round of financial assistance.

But Zandi said he's concerned that the good headline number in last week's jobs report might make it tougher to get the needed help passed through Congress.

""People might look at the better than anticipated jobs numbers, they say 'The coast is clear economically,'"" he said. ""That's the exact wrong message.""",2020-07-07,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/07/economy/job-losses-coronavirus/index.html

New York/London (CNN Business) Major companies are about to tell investors how they fared during the second quarter as the coronavirus swept over America. And there's no sugarcoating it. To paraphrase the title of a popular children's book: It was a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad three months.

Brace yourself: According to estimates compiled by FactSet, analysts predict that earnings for the S&P 500 plummeted nearly 45%, which would be the biggest drop since a 69% plunge during the depths of the Great Recession in the fourth quarter of 2008. Revenues are expected to have fallen more than 10%. Retailers, energy companies and industrial firms likely reported the biggest declines in sales and profit.

Chauncey Alcorn,"Strike for Black Lives demands union rights for workers at McDonald's, Amazon, Uber and others","New York (CNN Business) A coalition of Black advocacy groups and labor activists are organizing a nationwide strike to pressure corporations, such as McDonald's , Amazon , Uber and Lyft, to raise wages and allow their workers to form unions.

Thousands of workers are expected to walk off the job in more than 25 cities on July 20 in a mass demonstration called the Strike for Black Lives, organizers say. The strike takes aim at various industries in which Black workers are disproportionately represented, including fast food, airports, gig workers, nursing and home health aides.

The protest is being organized by the Movement for Black Lives — a coalition of black advocacy groups — and several labor rights organizations, including the Service Employee International Union and the fast-food industry labor advocacy group known as Fight for $15 and a Union. The American Federation of Teachers, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and United Farm Workers are also involved in the effort.

What they're demanding

Chief among the workers' demands is that their employers raise wages and let their employees form unions to advocate for improved health care, sick leave and other benefits.

Richard Wallace, a Movement for Black Lives leader, says his organization supports unions because they provide a pathway to more competitive wages and benefit for Black workers.

""You can't pay people minimum wage for a job, knowing it's not a living wage, knowing that [a plurality] of your workforce is black, and then come out and say, 'Black Lives Matter,'"" he told CNN Business. ""A collective bargaining agreement is the only ironclad way of ensuring those values that they're promoting in this moment are held onto in perpetuity until the contract is resolved.""

People gather to ask McDonald's to raise workers wages to a $15 minimum wage and demand the right to a union on May 23, 2019 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

Since the coronavirus crisis began, the SEIU and Fight for $15 have been organizing demonstrations across the country in support of essential workers who say they have been forced to work without personal protective equipment and, in some instances, have caught Covid-19

Both labor groups are fighting for union rights in workforce sectors where Black employees are overrepresented.

""Many corporations have been quick to claim that Black Lives Matter, yet they refuse to take concrete action to protect the health and economic security of their Black workers,"" SEIU President Mary Kay Henry told CNN Business.

McDonald's MCD reaffirmed its support for Black Lives Matter in a statement to CNN Business, but declined to directly address to questions about its workers forming a union.

""With one of the most diverse workforces in the world, we believe Black lives matter, and it is our responsibility to continue to listen and learn and push for a more inclusive society by being open, honest and candid,"" a McDonald's spokesperson said in an emailed statement.

Uber UBER Lyft LYFT anddid not immediately respond to requests for comment about the Strike for Black Lives. The companies have issued public statements showing support for black police brutality victims or the Black Lives Matter movement while starting programs to benefit Black Americans in recent weeks.

Black workers on the front line

Black Americans make up about 13% of the US population, but nearly 20% of workers in the nation's food preparation and serving sector, which includes fast-food employees, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. About 18% of Uber drivers and 17.6% of Lyft operations workers are Black.

BLS data also shows more than 37% of the country's nursing, psychiatric, and home health aides are Black. Many of those aides have been risking their own health to provide care to others while they themselves aren't provided with health insurance by their employers.

Sepia Coleman is a certified nursing assistant and home health aide from Memphis, Tennessee. She says she can't leave work to strike on July 20 but she plans to join the protest in solidarity after her shift.

Coleman says she was fired by her last nursing employer, which she asked CNN Business not to name, after she threatened to go public after she and several other nurses who work there were diagnosed with Covid-19.

In June, Coleman was hired as a nurse by another health care company, but she won't be eligible to receive company health care benefits for 90 days. At the moment, she's one of many home health workers providing care for others at the risk of catching Covid-19 while she herself doesn't have health insurance.

""I go to work every day, I pray and make sure I do what I have to do to keep out of harm's way,"" Coleman said. ""I say to myself, 'If I do get it again, I just pray to God I can recover from it.' If we had union rights, we'd be able to negotiate that so that we have insurance from the day we start.""

Scrutiny on Amazon

Workers protest against the failure from their employers to provide adequate protections in the workplace of the Amazon delivery hub on National May Day Walkout/Sickout by workers at Amazon, Whole Foods, Innstacart and Shipt amid the Covid-19 pandemic on May 1, 2020, in Hawthorne, California.

African Americans also make up more than 26% of the warehouse workforce at Amazon.

Recently the e-commerce giant has fired multiple employees involved in labor rights protests , though the company maintains those employees were let go for unrelated reasons.

Amazon has faced criticism from groups like Athena, a coalition of workers' rights groups and other advocacy organizations pushing the the company to grant higher wages and benefits to its disproportionately Black workforce.

A spokesperson for Athena said the organization is considering participating in the Strike for Black Lives as well.

""What remains true across these industries is their enormous fortunes have been amassed directly from the labor of Black and brown workers,"" Myaisha Hayes, campaign director at MediaJustice, a core member group in the Athena coalition, told CNN Business via email on Thursday.",2020-07-12,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/12/business/strike-for-black-lives-union-wages/index.html
Rachel Metz,A secretive and controversial startup may go public. Here's what you should know about it,"(CNN) In the 17 years since it was founded, Palantir Technologies has received financial backing from the CIA, become one of the most valuable private companies in the US, and earned a seat at the table alongside the biggest tech companies in meeting with President Donald Trump.

But the Silicon Valley data-analytics company, which is known for taking on controversial work for the US government, has long shrouded itself in secrecy — in part, as CEO and cofounder Alex Karp recently explained in an interview with Axios on HBO , because clients often require them to keep quiet. Now, it may have to shed at least some light on its operations as the company inches closer to making a long-rumored Wall Street debut.

Palantir said this week that it confidentially filed paperwork with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to go public. As with any publicly-traded company, Palantir would need to disclose more of its financial history and open itself to investor scrutiny. And as with any tech company of its size — with a roughly $20 billion valuation — its initial public offering would likely be a high-profile event.

""If they do go down the IPO path, it would be a seminal moment in technology, very similar to the likes of Uber and Lyft that were private for many years then went public,"" said Daniel Ives, an analyst with Wedbush who tracks tech companies.

Named after the seeing stones in J.R.R. Tolkien's fantasy novel ""The Lord of the Rings,"" Palantir is based in Palo Alto, California. The company has two products that customers use to organize and glean insights from mounds of data: Gotham, which was initially developed for government clients, and Foundry. Any data contained in SEC filings yet to be released publicly would almost certainly reveal more.

With Palantir's IPO, there's more at stake than investor returns. Some hope an IPO would lead to greater transparency, like Jacinta Gonzalez, senior campaign organizer of organizing group Mijente, which has long been critical of Palantir for its work with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and its ties to the Trump administration. But she's also worried that a successful IPO will show more companies that policing is good for business.

Palantir spokeswoman Lisa Gordon declined to comment for this story, citing the quiet period Palantir entered as it began the IPO process.

A history of bold claims—and controversial work

Cofounded in 2003 by Peter Thiel, a member of the so-called ""PayPal mafia"" and a longtime Facebook board member known for supporting Trump's 2016 campaign, Palantir's stated mission is to ""make the West, especially America, the strongest in the world."" The company touts its ability to manage and secure data at a massive scale.

Yet it has historically been quiet about the precise ways in which its services are used, which has earned the company a shadowy reputation. What's clear is that maintaining a relationship with the government has been key to the company for much of its history.

In its early years, Palantir struggled to get investors and clients, before raising money from the CIA's investment arm, In-Q-Tel, as well as from Thiel and his VC firm Founders Fund. Since then, the company has taken on work with the US government that others in Silicon Valley might not have been comfortable with.

Peter Thiel, co-founder of Palantir Technologies Inc., speaks during a news conference in Tokyo, Japan, on Monday, Nov. 18, 2019.

In 2017, CNN reported that Palantir had helped the Los Angeles Police Department analyze data , ranging from license plates photos to rap sheets, traffic tickets, listings of foreclosed properties and more. While this can make it easier for police to do things like track down criminals, it also indicates how technology such as Palantir's offers law enforcement unprecedented surveillance capabilities.

More recently, Karp said in an interview with CNBC at Davos in January that Palantir has been assisting with finding undocumented immigrants for deportation — something that had long been rumored but unconfirmed.

""We take what amounts to strong but often controversial positions,"" Karp said at the time.

And in May, Karp acknowledged in an interview with Axios on HBO that Palantir's technology ""is used on occasion to kill people."" He made clear that it can be used for targeting of all kinds, including people. ""If you're looking for a terrorist in the world now you're probably using our government product and you're probably doing the operation that actually takes out the person in another product we built,"" he said, most likely referring to Gotham and Foundry, respectively.

At a time when companies such as Amazon and Microsoft said they have halted the sale of some contested technology — namely facial-recognition systems — to US police departments, Palantir is ""sort of the opposite,"" said Evan Greer, deputy director at digital rights nonprofit Fight for the Future.

""I think companies like Palantir are allowing governments and institutions to weaponize our data and use it in ways that oppress people rather than lift them up,"" Greer said.

The contrarian may cash in again

Just as Palantir is among the most controversial companies in Silicon Valley, so is its most famous cofounder.

He was also discovered to be bankrolling the lawsuit of Terry Bollea, popularly known as the wrestler Hulk Hogan, against Gawker Media that forced the publisher into bankruptcy. Yet he has also donated to the Committee to Protect Journalists.

""It's precisely because I respect journalists that I do not believe they are endangered by fighting back against Gawker,"" he said in a 2016 interview , as part of his explanation for why he didn't think the two activities contradicted each other.

A libertarian, he served as a surrogate for Donald Trump's 2016 campaign, going against many powerful tech CEOs and criticizing Silicon Valley in the process.

Thiel, who has invested at least $40 million in Palantir, has defended the company's role despite his previously articulated anti-government approach. ""The government was collecting a lot of data [in the war on terrorism], more than they could analyze,"" he told Fortune in March 2016. ""If we could help them make sense of data, they could end indiscriminate surveillance.""

Unlike PayPal, which was inspired by the idea of creating a currency ""free from all government control and dilution,"" Palantir is helping empower government agencies: it scored $1.5 billion in new contracts with the US government in 2019 alone.

But Palantir may have at least one thing in common with PayPal: it will likely make Thiel a lot of money.",2020-07-10,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/10/tech/palantir-ipo-explainer/index.html
Chris Isidore,"Ford pressured to stop selling police cars, but it won't get out of the business","New York (CNN Business) Ford CEO Jim Hackett rejected employees' calls to get out of the police car business, saying the automaker can support the Black Lives Matter movement while selling the majority of America's police cars.

Ford F Hackett, in a recent memo to staff, acknowledged that someemployees are urging the company to stop making police cars because of a series of high-profile killings of Black Americans by police.

Goldman Sachs this week predicted the CSI 300 — an index of big cap stocks in Shanghai and Shenzhen — would rise another 15% within the next few months, which the analysts attributed to a ""robust economic reopening"" and ""positive government rhetoric towards the equity market,"" among other factors.

China's stock markets are not open in the way other major international exchanges are. Virtually all investors in mainland stock markets are individual traders, according to recent survey data from the China Securities Depository and Clearing Corporation.

But the rally is significant for what it says about how eager the country is to project an image of a healthy stock market to the rest of the world, particularly as it comes under an increasing level of international scrutiny over its handling of the coronavirus outbreak and the implementation of a sweeping national security law in Hong Kong.

""The rally projects Beijing's preferred image of a thriving, successful society,"" said Brock Silvers, chief investment officer for Hong Kong-based Adamas Asset Management.

There are risks to jumping too high, too fast, though — something of which China seems keenly aware.

""A rising stock market will ease companies' fundraising difficulties, boost the real economy and accelerate work resumption,"" wrote the state-owned Economic Daily in a commentary piece published Friday. ""But a bull market doesn't mean we should let the market get out of control.""

Stocks cooled somewhat on Friday: The Shanghai Composite, for example, lost nearly 2%, though that wasn't enough to kill its historic gain. State media reports attributed the retreat to news that the country's social security reserve fund would unload hundreds of millions of shares in a major state insurer, the People's Insurance Company of China — a warning sign that Beijing might think the market surge is happening too quickly.

Analysts also warn that the bull run could risk losing steam. Though China's economy is recovering, it remains weak , said Silvers. He added that the economic implications of the security law in Hong Kong are also not yet known, and pointed out that tensions between the United States and China might cause more economic woes.

""To the extent that the image isn't supported by underlying economic fundamentals, it may prove to be something of a mirage,"" Silvers said. ""Today's equity bulls may pay the price.""

A risky strategy

""The decoupling between stock prices and economic fundamentals is not a 'China phenomenon' per se, but a global one,"" said Jing Sima, a China investment strategist at BCA Research. ""In fact, Chinese stocks have not diverged from domestic economic fundamentals as much as their global peers.""

And just as US President Donald Trump frequently links the success of his presidency and the economy to how well the stock market is doing, former top officials in China have joined the country's state media in arguing that a bull market is needed to offset economic headwinds.

""The central leading body of the [Chinese Communist Party] has never attached as much importance to the capital market as it does now,"" said Xiao Gang, the former chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, during a financial conference on Tuesday.

Xiao — who presided over the commission during the China's stock market turbulence of 2015 — called on the country to transform its economy and compete with the West on technology and financial development.

But ""using the stock market as a tool to shore up the economy is a risky strategy,"" wrote Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist for Capital Economics, in a Thursday research note.

He said there are some economic benefits to a market rally, such as making it easier for firms that are publicly listed to raise cash when their balance sheets are under strain. A flurry of trading activity would also directly boost GDP, he added.

But Evans-Pritchard said a state endorsement of rising prices would encourage investors to view the market as a ""one-way bet.""

""Once a major rally takes hold, it can become self-feeding as retail investors pile in,"" he said.

Echoes of 2015

The biggest concern is whether the boom in China's stock market could be followed by a major bust, like what happened in 2015. That summer, the Shanghai Composite collapsed 30% in three weeks after gaining 150% in a year. The volatility — which experts attributed to slowing economic growth and risky trading practices , compounded by a bullish state media — continued for months, triggering a global rout.

""Despite belated official efforts to tame the rally in 2015, prices kept rising and departing further from economic fundamentals until they collapsed under their own weight,"" Evans-Pritchard wrote.

There are some similarities between now and then. The rise in 2014-2015 was characterized by new traders flooding into the market, wrote Oliver Jones, senior markets economist at Capital Economics, in a Thursday research note. He noted that trading volumes have increased in China recently, too.

Chinese state media is also once again acting as a cheerleader for the market surge. Jones noted that the Shanghai Composite and Shenzhen Composite indexes surged Monday ""despite no major news on the economy or the spread of coronavirus, after an editorial in state media sanctioned the 'healthy' rally.""

But there are reasons to believe that things will be different this time around. Evans-Pritchard said it's encouraging that the pickup in margin trading — using borrowed funds to make investments — is more modest than it was then. He added that tighter restrictions on secretive borrowing and lending practices should have also reduced risks.

""But stricter access to leverage won't necessarily avert a bubble,"" he said, adding that ""officials will need to act quickly to take some steam out of the rally and prevent expectations becoming too one-sided.""",2020-07-10,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/10/investing/china-bull-market-intl-hnk/index.html
Frank Pallotta,Disney Parks chief on reopening: 'We are in a new normal',"""We are in a new normal,"" said D'Amaro, who started the job in May. ""The world is a different place, but we feel really prepared to operate in this new environment.""

D'Amaro spoke with CNN Business on Saturday about reopening as coronavirus cases surge in Florida , the criticisms around opening ""The Most Magical Place on Earth"" in the middle of a pandemic and their recent decision to retheme the racially problematic Splash Mountain.

This interview has been edited and condensed.

Coronavirus cases are surging in Florida, why is Disney World reopening right now? Isn't reopening in this climate unsafe?

We are in a new normal right now, so what's happening outside of the gates of Walt Disney World is our new world. I think you know we were one of the first theme parks to close, and we'll be about the last to open. And we spent every minute of every day thinking about how to operate in this new normal that we're in.

I'm exceptionally proud of this group in terms of what they've put together from a protocol perspective and being able to open in a phased and really responsible way. I had a chance to walk Main Street just a few minutes ago. It feels really good in the park. So yeah, the world is a different place, but we feel really prepared to operate in this new environment that we're in.

What guarantees can you offer to guests that they'll be safe inside of your park?

We've got a screening process, for example. When folks enter the park, they'll be temperature checked. Everyone will be wearing a mask. Sanitizers are basically everywhere in the theme park. We've programmed the environment with six-foot social distancing everywhere that you go, whether that's on an attraction, in the merchandise shop, in the food and beverage [areas.]

The experience will look different. So, you won't necessarily see fireworks anymore, but you still will feel some of that magic that people are accustomed to experiencing at Disney. Our training is really aggressive with our cast members. I had a chance to speak with cast members over the course of the last couple of days. They're incredibly prepared.

What else?

Communication to our guests, who also have a responsibility here, has been really pervasive as well, so they come prepared with their face masks and understanding what social distancing looks like. And then, we're in control of the environment. We have a reservations system that we've put in place that allows us to control how many guests are inside of our parks. And then finally we're doing this in a phased fashion. We will, take our time and with the right way and make sure that guests feel comfortable and that we're feeling comfortable with the operation.

Speaking of guests: Two of the safety requirements for Disney World are wearing masks and proper social distancing. But how are the parks going to make sure that guests are following these guidelines? We've seen many across the country avoid these rules. How do you guys plan on enforcing them?

So first of all, from a communication perspective, we've been incredibly aggressive in communicating to our guests. We've actually had a little bit of fun with that as well, using our intellectual property and The Incredibles, letting the guests know that they have a part in this whole process.

The other thing that we have the benefit of is parks around the world. And we've had a chance to open parks around the world and watch how guests are behaving and shift our operations as necessary. In fact, Disney Springs just opened recently right here in Orlando, and we've had the benefit of working with our guests and our cast members to make sure everybody's doing their part. And they are.

We've been really impressed with guests understanding when they come into this environment that it is a new environment and they have a responsibility as well. And it's working really well. And again, just walking around Walt Disney World this morning, everybody looks fantastic in their face masks, and they all have them on.

But some people may refuse to wear a mask. Some people may take it off and not put it back on. Do you guys have any structures in place to deal with this situation when people break the rules?

We've actually seen incredible cooperation from our guests, first of all. And if anybody loses sight of what's necessary when they're in the park, we have cast members, again, that are exceptionally well-trained. In fact, we have very specific cast member groups, I think we call them ""The Incredi-Crew,"" leveraging the communication that I talked about a little bit earlier. And they'll very nicely remind somebody, ""Pull your face mask up,"" or, ""If you're not eating or drinking, make sure you have your face mask on."" And that seems to be working pretty well.

Did you, at any point since announcing the reopening date, reconsider opening Disney World as cases in Florida spiked?

Listen, we are watching the external environment really carefully. But what we've done here is we've built an operations protocol. We've phased this opening. We put ourselves in complete control. But our confidence has always been high that independent of what's happening on the outside of our gates, we're in a position to open responsibly. And again, it's validated when you go and you talk to our cast members and you see the guests coming in this morning. So, we're really confident with our approach.

If the situation gets worse in Florida, at what point would Disney consider re-closing Disney World?

Well, first, what I'm focused on right now is getting the park open, which I'm really proud of and, again, seeing the guests come in this morning. We built our operation, so we can flex. And so, we'll flex with what's happening on the outside from, again, controlled attendance to training our cast members to kind of watch the motions inside of the park.

Disney has a workforce of about 75,000, which makes it America's largest single site workforce. And many of them may be worried or even scared about returning to work. What do you say to those cast members?

Well, I had the benefit yesterday of walking around both of our parks, and I talked to literally hundreds of cast members, and this is a new environment for our cast. When they come back, they're getting trained in a brand-new way. I think I see the confidence in the cast members' eyes. I hear it in what they're playing back to us.

There's no doubt that at some point people might feel a little bit nervous, but once we train them and help them understand the protocols that we have into place, the way in which they're going to interact with guests, the way that we've programmed the whole operation, their confidence is incredibly high. And this is something I take very seriously. We do have a lot of cast members here. This is our number one priority, to make sure that they feel equipped to do their job in the best way possible.

There's been criticism about Disney reopening in this climate. Do you think that's fair?

I can understand people's criticisms, but again, I am incredibly confident about where we are from an operations perspective. And when guests are ready to come, they can come. It's their choice. We will be ready and open for business and ready to make that magic that we always make.

Disney announced it would be re-theming Splash Mountain into ""The Princess and the Frog"" from the controversial ""Song of the South."" What role did the Black Lives Matter protests and conversations about race in recent weeks have in influencing the timing of the announcement?

We actually have been working on it for well over a year. In fact, I was a part of those conversations over a year ago. Listen, our stories evolve all the time. I mean, back from when Walt started Disneyland back in 1955, he stated that if we would continue to evolve our stories, that they're never ending, that they'll always be contemporary. And I think that that's what you're seeing with Splash Mountain.

I keep using the same word, but I'm really proud of this team and what we're doing on this front. I think Splash Mountain, no doubt, is a sacred attraction to many of our guests. And I think you're going to love what we're doing in making the attraction even more contemporary.",2020-07-11,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/11/media/disney-world-reopening-disney-parks-chief/index.html
Oliver Darcy,Tucker Carlson's top writer resigns after secretly posting racist and sexist remarks in online forum,"The top writer for Fox News host Tucker Carlson has for years been using a pseudonym to post bigoted remarks on an online forum that is a hotbed for racist, sexist, and other offensive content, CNN Business learned this week.

Just this week, the writer, Blake Neff, responded to a thread started by another user in 2018 with the subject line, ""Would u let a JET BLACK congo n****er do lasik eye surgery on u for 50% off?"" Neff wrote, ""I wouldn't get LASIK from an Asian for free, so no."" (The subject line was not censored on the forum.) On June 5, Neff wrote, ""Black doods staying inside playing Call of Duty is probably one of the biggest factors keeping crime down."" On June 24, Neff commented, ""Honestly given how tired black people always claim to be, maybe the real crisis is their lack of sleep."" On June 26, Neff wrote that the only people who care about changing the name of the NFL's Washington Redskins are ""white libs and their university-'educated' pets.""

And over the course of five years, Neff has maintained a lengthy thread in which he has derided a woman and posted information about her dating life that has invited other users to mock her and invade her privacy. There has at times also been overlap between some material he posted or saw on the forum and Carlson's show.

CNN Business contacted Neff for comment Thursday night. After he or someone acting on his behalf passed that email to Fox News spokespeople, a network spokesperson on Friday morning told CNN Business that Neff had resigned. A Fox News spokesperson said on Friday that Carlson could not be reached for comment. Neff did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

In a memo sent to employees Saturday afternoon, after this story was first published, Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott and President Jay Wallace condemned ""horrific racist, misogynistic and homophobic behavior.""

""Neff's abhorrent conduct on this forum was never divulged to the show or the network until Friday, at which point we swiftly accepted his resignation,"" Scott and Wallace wrote. ""Make no mistake, actions such as his cannot and will not be tolerated at any time in any part of our work force.""

Scott and Wallace said that Carlson would address the matter on his Monday show.

Neff worked at Fox News for nearly four years and was Carlson's top writer. Previously, he was a reporter at The Daily Caller, a conservative news outlet that Carlson co-founded. In a recent article in the Dartmouth Alumni Magazine , Neff said, ""Anything [Carlson is] reading off the teleprompter, the first draft was written by me."" He also acknowledged the show's influence, telling the magazine, ""We're very aware that we do have that power to sway the conversation, so we try to use it responsibly.""

When asked in a 2018 appearance on Fox's ""The Five"" about the writing process for his show, Carlson said he spends hours working on scripts, but referred to Neff by name, saying he was a ""wonderful writer"" and acknowledging his assistance. And Carlson credited Neff in the acknowledgments of his book, ""Ship of Fools,"" for providing research. In the acknowledgments, Carlson said that Neff and two others who helped with the book ""work on and greatly improve our nightly show on Fox.""

During the years that Neff wrote for him at Fox, Carlson has hosted one of the most influential shows on cable news. In the last quarter, Carlson had not only the highest-rated program in cable news, but the highest-rated show in the history of cable news . Carlson also counts President Trump among his most loyal viewers. On multiple occasions, the President has tweeted out videos of Carlson's program. Which is to say, the scripts that Neff likely helped write and shape were being shared by the President of the United States.

While working at Fox News, and while a reporter at The Daily Caller, Neff was a frequent poster on AutoAdmit. Also known as XOXOhth, it is a relatively unmoderated message board like 4chan aimed at lawyers and law school students in which racism and sexism run rampant. The board's vulgar content was previously the subject of much criticism, and two Yale students sued anonymous posters on the site in 2007 alleging they had defamed them and made threatening remarks. The Hartford Courant reported in 2009 that the lawsuit was quietly settled after some of the posters were identified.

Neff, who posts on the board under the username CharlesXII, is widely revered on the forum, with many posters knowing the person behind the account works on Carlson's show. He has spent years posting about history, offering his political opinions, and detailing aspects of his personal life.

After learning of Neff's posts on the board through an email from an anonymous tipster, CNN Business was able to positively identify CharlesXII as Neff by reviewing messages he has posted throughout the years on the forum and matching them up with publicly available information about him.

Among the details which make clear that CharlesXII and Neff are the same person: CharlesXII indicated on the board that he had gone to Dartmouth; Neff is an alumnus. CharlesXII said he had been working for nearly four years in his current journalism job in Washington DC; Neff has been working for Carlson at Fox in Washington since February 2017, according to his LinkedIn profile, which appears to have been removed after his resignation from Fox News. CharlesXII said on the board that he got his start in journalism after he turned down law school and instead took a fellowship; Neff told the Dartmouth Alumni Magazine that he took a fellowship with the Collegiate Network.

CharlesXII also wrote a parody version of the song ""We Didn't Start The Fire"" and posted about it on the board, including a screen shot of an email he received from Carlson praising a lyric in the song. Neff sang the parody song at a Daily Caller Christmas party a few years ago, according to a person familiar with the event.

The Daily Caller declined to comment.

And in a 2017 Washington Post Date Lab article featuring Neff, he dropped a number of Easter eggs for the board, including referencing an ""alcohol is poison"" meme that he has repeatedly posted about and carrying a book on Catherine the Great to a date. His username on the forum, CharlesXII, is a reference to Charles XII of Sweden, a king known for his military victories and who abstained from sex and alcohol. Neff, a history buff interested in wars and military battles, has repeatedly disclosed on the forum that he rarely drinks and The Post story said he rarely dates.

Even more clearly identifying, however, were photos that CharlesXII posted to the forum in 2018 to the forum after visiting a museum in Egypt. In three of the photos, a reflection of Neff is visible snapping the pictures in the artifacts' glass enclosures.

While at Fox News, Carlson has been accused by critics of making racist and inflammatory comments on air. His show has long appealed to extremists who agree with his hardline views on immigration, his emphasis on the preservation of Western culture, and his commentary on topics of race.

Carlson has at several points in his Fox News career found himself in hot water when commenting on such topics. In August 2019, for instance, Carlson became engulfed in controversy when he said the very real problem of white supremacy in America was a ""hoax."" Most recently, Carlson saw more advertisers — including Disney and T-Mobile — flee his program in June after he said the Black Lives Matter movement was ""not about black lives"" and warned viewers to ""remember that when they come for you."" (A Fox News spokesperson later said Carlson was referring to Democratic leaders, not Black Lives Matter protesters, when he made the comments.)

Carlson himself has in the past pushed back against allegations of racism. He told The Atlantic in December 2019 that such accusations are ""so far from the truth"" that it has ""no effect at all other than to evoke in me contempt for the people saying it"" because he thinks ""it's that dishonest.""

Bigotry and vitriol

In 2015, Neff started a thread on AutoAdmit mocking a woman, with whom he was friends on Facebook and whom he described as an ""Azn megashrew,"" sharing posts she had written about her dating life. He has continued to post to the thread and mock the woman, whom CNN Business is not identifying, as recently as late last month. In his first post in 2015 starting the years-long thread, he explained that ""through circumstances"" he couldn't ""quite recall,"" he became Facebook friends with the woman and thought her posts about dating were amusing.

""So, I thought I'd post them,"" Neff wrote. ""I won't put up a pic but it's probably relevant to say that she's a slightly overweight Azn woman who is in her mid-30s and definitely looks it.""

Through the years, the thread has generated nearly 1,000 comments — many of which used vulgar racist, sexist, and dehumanizing language to mock the woman. Neff also said he did not want other posters to harass her, but did not stop them from identifying her and posting links to her account. He also posted some photos from her account that did not show her face and continued posting about her dating life for years after the other posters had identified her.

Reached for comment, the woman told CNN Business, ""When I was recently made aware of Blake's posts about me on racist websites, I was overcome with disappointment which eventually mixed with bewilderment that he spent years dedicated to creating a false narrative based on my satirical writing about my life. The nature of online media is that your identity, while nominally under your control, is vulnerable to being misused. Any public figure can attest to this problem.""

In March 2020, Neff started another lengthy thread mocking a separate woman with whom he was connected on social media. The woman had posted about freezing her eggs, and Neff apparently found that worth deriding in the AutoAdmit forum. He began posting about her in March of this year, in a thread he titled ""Disaster: WuFlu outbreak endangers aging shrew's quest to freeze eggs."" Neff posted to the thread, which racked up dozens of comments as users ridicule the woman, as recently as June 28.

I was overcome with disappointment which eventually mixed with bewilderment that he spent years dedicated to creating a false narrative based on my satirical writing about my life. Anonymous

On the forum, Neff has also expressed bigoted views. In 2014, he joked about ""foodie faggots."" And in the same year, he started a thread titled, ""Urban business idea: He Didn't Do Muffin!"" He joked one item could be, ""Sandra Bland's Sugar-free Shortbreads!"" In August 2019, a user started a thread titled, ""We should just buy Canada and kick the Canadians out."" Neff commented, ""Okay but what do we do with the millions of Chinese people.""

More recently, in February 2020, Neff called Mormonism ""an inherently cucky religion."" On June 5, a user on the forum commented in a thread, ""Didn't Michael Brown rob a store and attack a police officer? And wasn't [George Floyd] a piece of shit with a long criminal record? Jfc libs."" Another person commented, ""It doesn't matter to these people."" Neff then replied, ""It does. The violent criminals are even MORE heroic."" On June 16, a user started a separate thread about a video showing a Black man assaulting an elderly white woman in New York. Neff commented on the thread, ""And to think, if this guy got killed in some freak incident while being arrested, we'd have to endure at least three funerals in his honor.""

On the Fourth of July, Neff started a thread in which he jokingly ""rated"" members of the community using images from a 1990s video game from the makers of ""Oregon Trail"" that was pulled from the market due to its racist depictions of slaves. In the game, users play as slaves trying to break free and escape north. Neff assigned users on the forum images from the game, many of which depicted Black slaves using racist stereotypes. For instance, Neff assigned one user an image of a slave catcher, to which the user replied ""[thank you] massa Charles for dis.""

On May 27, Neff wrote that Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley, and Rashida Tlaib — known collectively as ""The Squad"" — want to ""MAKE YOUR COUNTRY A DUMPING GROUND FOR PEOPLE FROM THIRD WORLD SHITHOLES."" Responding to a thread on June 27 about whether ""whites fear what's going to happen to them in 10-20 yrs,"" Neff wrote that he has ""no plans to stay"" in the country ""that long."" In December 2019, he said that ""once Democrats have the majorities to go full F**K WHITEY, things are going to get really wacky really quickly."" He argued at the time that there is a ""large minority of whites who are fully supportive of a F**k Whitey agenda"" and that ""there's a suicidal impulse to Western peoples that honestly feels almost biological in origin.""

When not making his own bigoted comments, Neff has shown a willingness to respond to others who were, without expressing any hesitation, much less disgust, about what they've said. For instance, in 2016 he replied to a thread with the title, ""Mary Poppins getting raped by a pack of wild ni***rs at the park; kids watching."" That same year, he commented on a thread titled, ""DIKES get wrong CUM at CUMBANK. N****R pops out."" Just last month, Neff replied to a comment on the thread that said, ""And the n**s are always honor students or some bullshit."" (The language on both posts was not censored on the forum.)

Last month, Neff mocked a user who said they were leaving the board over concerns about the rampant racism on it. In a now-deleted comment, the user implored others to ""consider the current environment,"" writing, ""The country is undergoing a great awakening to racist injustices throughout society. Maybe you should take this opportunity to consider whether continuing to post here is morally defensible at all, even if you aren't posting deranged shit? I don't think it is defensible, which is why I am leaving.""

On June 16, Neff responded by quoting the user's words and adding, ""LMAO if you think this shit will save you when the mob comes for you. Good riddance."" The language notably echoed Carlson's comment, eight days before, when he had said ""remember that when they come for you.""

In February 2018, a user on AutoAdmit posted, ""At some point in the future, all ur xo posts (w/IRL name) will be public record."" One person commented, ""I stand by every poast."" Neff upvoted that comment.

Easter eggs

When he had just started working at Fox News, Neff was apparently less cautious and more willing to risk exposing his identity for a chance to show off to his fellow posters.

One night in February 2017 -- which, according to his LinkedIn, would have been Neff's second month with Carlson at Fox News — Carlson tripped over his words as he introduced a guest. The phrase Carlson was trying to say was, even for the host's florid style, a little out of place: ""Sweet treats of scholarship.""

Within minutes, Neff was posting to AutoAdmit about Carlson's use of the phrase, which other posters gleefully noted was a reference to something said on the forum.

Neff's caution since then may have resulted in fewer Easter eggs being slipped into Carlson's scripts. But there has still been at least some overlap between the forum and the show, including in recent weeks.

Sometimes, material Neff encountered on the forum found its way on to Carlson's show. For instance, on June 25, Neff responded to a post that quoted a news story about coronavirus-related interest in Montana real estate. He wrote on the forum, ""Interest in real estate in Bozeman, Missoula, and the Flathead Valley has been on the rise for years."" That night, in his monologue, Carlson said, ""You're starting to consider maybe moving to Bozeman, and why wouldn't you?""

In some cases, language Neff used on the forum ended up on the show. The night of June 15, in commenting on a football coach who was the subject of controversy over a sweatshirt he'd worn, Neff wrote on the forum, ""[I]t is your f***ing right as an American to wear whatever T-shirt you want, and hold whatever political views you want. Christ."" The next night on his show, Carlson said, ""And they can wear whatever shirts they want. You thought that was true. You thought that was your right as an American.""

Other times, Neff may have used knowledge he had gained in his job at Fox News to post to the board. On the afternoon of July 1, Neff started a thread titled, ""Two GOP senators propose replacing Columbus Day w/Juneteenth."" In the thread, he wrote, ""Coming out this afternoon if it isn't out already."" That afternoon, it was public; that night, the proposal was discussed on Carlson's show.

Chris Isidore,Middle seats and packed planes are coming back as airlines prepare to ease restrictions,"US airlines had stopped selling them for months, both to ensure social distancing and because of a lack of passengers. But with a modest rebound in flying , that is changing.

, the world's largest carrier disclosed Friday that ""customers may notice that flights are booked to capacity starting July 1."" This change comes even as the number of Covid-19 cases rises in many states.

has been willing to sell every possible seat throughout the pandemic. Both said they would notify passengers when a flight has more than 70% of its seats booked, and allow them to change to a less crowded flight. But that won't necessarily allow passengers with limited flexibility to avoid crowded flights.

The empty seats had been a result of low demand for air travel combined with airline policy meant to encourage people to feel safe about flying. But on Sunday there were 634,000 people passing through TSA checkpoints at US airports, which was 24% of the traffic on the same day last summer. That's the highest total since late March and is seven times as many people as were screened the low point in mid-April.

And with so many planes parked and fewer flights taking off than a year ago, passengers are quickly filing up a much greater percentage of available seats -- about 55% of all seats on planes during the week ending June 21, according to Airlines for America. And that's been climbing steadily since April.

Delta DAL Southwest LUV JetBlue JBLU andall have policies to leave the middle seat empty. But how long they will stay with those policies is unclear. JetBlue has committed to the empty seats through the end of July. Southwest and Delta have said the policy will be in effect through Sept. 30.

Delta CEO Ed Bastian told shareholders at the annual meeting two weeks ago that it could lift that limitation come fall.

""And as the business starts to return, as demand starts to grow, and if people have more confidence in their travel experience, we will decide later in this year when we start to ease up on that cap restriction,"" he said. But last week he clarified to the BBC that doesn't necessarily mean it will start selling all seats on the plane starting in October.

""Whether it's 60% [of seats being sold] or a slightly higher number I don't know, but yes we absolutely will"" keep some limits on the percentage of seats sold in place, he said.

Southwest has thus far not offered any similar assurances past Sept. 30.

The airlines say they are taking other steps to make flying safe, including enhanced cleaning strict policies requiring the use of masks and filters that remove very small particles including viruses and bacteria from the cabin air.

It's not clear whether airlines will lose reluctant passengers by deciding to sell the middle seat said Philip Baggaley, chief airline credit analyst for Standard & Poor's.

""At the moment, most people don't want to get on an airplane anyway,"" he said. ""Those that do have made a determination that they have to fly, or feel safe flying. Not sure how large the group is that would be dissuaded by a full plane.""

""But if the recovery in flying continues, there is a greater risk that you are scaring away a more material number of passengers by selling middle seats,"" he added.

Airlines elsewhere in the world have not put policies in place that have left seats empty, said John Grant, aviation analyst with tracking service OAG. He said the only broad limit is a rule put in place by Chinese authorities that international flights to and from that country can sell no more than 75% of its seats.

The problem for the airlines is that during normal times they need to sell somewhere between 60% and 73% of seats just to break even, Grant said, depending on their cost structure. US and European airlines typically have the higher break-even point.

Last year US airlines sold a record 85% of domestic seats, helping them to one of the most profitable years on record. But it is not expected to get back to that level of demand for years to come

Grant says that given seat widths, leaving the middle seat open leaves less than two feet between passengers, not enough for those who want to stay six feet away.

""Keeping the seat open might reassure some passengers, but there is no scientific evidence that you elevate the chance of infection by a factor of Y% by using the middle seat,"" he said. ""I think there's less chance of scaring people away because you sell the middle seats than if you charge 30% more to keep the seat empty.""

But others say the airlines do risk scaring away customers who were on the fence about flying.

""People didn't like middle seats before and they like them even less now,"" said Stephen Beck, managing partner of cg42, a management consultant who has advised airlines. ""While this will allow them to fill a few more flights to capacity, but will the inevitable negative PR be worth filling those seats? I would question that.""

Chris Isidore,Time could be running out for the 747,"New York (CNN Business) The 747 is perhaps the most popular plane in Boeing's history. But the embattled aircraft maker could be getting close to finally pulling the plug on the once groundbreaking jumbo jet with the distinctive second-floor bulge.

The company hasn't built a passenger version of the plane since it delivered the last one to Korean Airlines in 2017. Rival dropped its own jumbo jet , the A380 last year.was the last US airline to fly a passenger version of the plane, also in 2017. That was the last year the 747 flights -- by both Delta and-- drew large crowds of the plane's fans, a testament to its enduring popularity.

Crowds gathered at Narita airport near Tokyo to see off the final flights of a Delta Boeing 747 in October 2017. Delta was the last US airline to fly a passenger version of the beloved jet. How long Boeing will keep building the freighter version of the plane is now in question.

But since then,has built only a freighter version of the jet at a slowed production rate of one every two months, half the previous pace.

Its order book for even that version of the jet is extremely short -- only 12 remaining firm orders from, and three orders for a Russian cargo carrier which Boeing no longer counts as certain enough to be listed in its backlog of orders.

UPS says it is very happy with the plane, having taken delivery of its 16th 747 freighter just more than a week ago.

""The 747-8 is an incredibly capable aircraft, with capacity that is unmatched by any other freighter in production,"" said UPS. ""With a maximum payload of 307,000 lbs., we use them on long, high-volume routes, connecting Asia, North America, Europe and the Middle East.""

But it's no longer clear that it's worth the expense to Boeing as it scrambles to cut costs and 16,000 jobs in the face of the worst downturn the aerospace industry has perhaps ever seen.

On Thursday Bloomberg reported that Boeing is preparing to announce the end of production of the plane after the existing orders are filled. It cited estimates that Boeing is losing $40 million on each of the jets, and it's taking up too much space in its Washington state factory given the slow rate of production. Boeing issued a statement neither confirming nor denying plans to discontinue the plane.

""At a build rate of half an airplane per month, the 747-8 program has more than two years of production ahead of it in order to fulfill our current customer commitments. We will continue to make the right decisions to keep the production line healthy and meet customer needs,"" said Boeing.

The plane just turned 50 at the end of last year. Boeing delivered the first 747 passenger jets in December of 1969 to two airlines that no longer exist - TWA and Pan Am. While the cargo version of the jets are still very useful, the passenger version has apparently outlived its usefulness.

Picture of the first Boeing 747 rolling out of the Boeing's plant in Washington state in September 1968. The plane entered service in January 1970, on Pan Am's New York-London route.

There are only 171 of the passenger versions of the jet still in fleets of airlines around the world, and only 27 of those are now in use, according to the Cirium Fleets database, a research firm that tracks commercial jets.

While that's up from only two of the planes that were flying at the end of April, it's not clear when there will be a need for most of the 144 grounded 747 passenger jets to return to service, especially since international air travel, the routes on which they were most often used, is expected to be the slowest to bounce back even when people start flying again.

The large supply of unneeded passenger 747 planes is another blow to the chances Boeing continuing to build a freighter version of the 747 jets. Unused passenger jets have frequently been converted into freighters. While a new 747 freighter might have some efficiency advantages over the older converted versions, it might not be enough if the cost of used passenger jets drops enough.

FedEx FDX And Boeing has another jumbo jet for which it has freighters -- the 777, of whichhas more than 40 of the jets in its fleet. It doesn't have the capacity of a 747 freighter, but Boeing at least has unfilled orders for 45 of the 777 freighters from nine different customers, including FedEx.

It is also reportedly having conversations with customers about a freighter version of the new, larger version of the 777, the 777X, which is in the process of being certified to fly.

There are more than 300 orders for the passenger version of the 777X, which makes it one of the bedrock planes of Boeing's future plans, unlike the 747.

There are two ""passenger"" versions of the plane now being worked on, but it's not for any commercial airline. Instead they are destined to be the new Air Force Ones

In February of this year, Boeing began the process of converting two existing 747-8 jets into the new fleet of presidential jets at a cost of $3.9 billion for the two planes. That work, due to take four years, is expected to continue no matter what decision is made about the 747's future.",2020-07-05,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/05/business/boeing-747-future/index.html
Chris Isidore,Airlines follow through on threat to ban passengers who don't wear masks,"New York (CNN Business) Airlines are making good on their threat to ban passengers from future flights for refusing to wear masks.

is the latest to announce bans for an undisclosed number of passengers who would not comply with industry policy requiring passengers to wear masks

""So far, there have thankfully only been a handful of cases, but we have already banned some passengers from future travel on Delta for refusing to wear masks on board,"" wrote CEO Ed Bastian in an memo to Delta employees Thursday.

Industry leaderhas already taken steps to ban at least one passenger , Brandon Straka, who was asked to get off a New York to Dallas flight for refusing to wear a mask. American said Straka would be allowed to fly American again only once the policy requiring masks is lifted.

, which last week announced a policy to ban passengers from future flights who fail to comply with the mask requirement, confirmed Thursday that it had also taken such action.

The airlines say they are not sharing information with one another about the passengers they have banned. So, for example, a passenger banned on Delta can still book a flight on American and vice versa.

Bastian, the Delta CEO, defended the get-tough policy as important to protect the health and safety of both passengers and crew members.

""Parts of the country have seen a resurgence of Covid-19, and this week new cases nationwide grew at their highest level since April,"" he wrote. ""That's why it is more important than ever to adhere to the safety and health guidelines we have put in place to keep you safe. One of the most effective measures we have is wearing a mask, which numerous studies have shown can slow the spread of the virus. We take the requirement to wear a mask very seriously.""

He disclosed at Delta's annual meeting last week that 500 of the company's employees have tested positive for Covid-19 since March, and that 10 have died. With about 90,000 employees, Delta's employee infection rate is roughly in line with that of the national population. Delta has also instituted a plan to test all of its employees.

Southwest LUV Airlines first instituted the masks-required policy for passengers in May, but the enforcement was initially far more lax confirmed at that time that passengers not wearing masks would still be allowed to board, and American said flight attendant's role in asking passengers to wear masks was ""informational, not enforcement.""

But travel was still well below 90% of year ago levels of that time, allowing for lots of empty seats and rows between passengers.

Since then airlines have started filling a comparatively much greater percentage of seats , although overall travel is still more than 75% below year-ago levels.

Delta has maintained it will not book passengers in middle seats until at least September 30. But Bastian revealed last week it is considering lifting that limitation in the future.

""As the business starts to return, as demand starts to grow, and if people have more confidence in their travel experience, we will decide later in this year when we start to ease up on that cap restriction,"" he said at the meeting.

Bastian also announced Thursday that to meet the increased demand while leaving middle seats empty, Delta will add 1,000 flights to its daily schedule in July, and another 1,000 a day in August.",2020-06-25,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/25/business/airline-passenger-ban-not-wearing-masks/index.html
Chris Isidore,United is mortgaging its frequent flyer program to raise $5 billion,"New York (CNN Business) United Airlines is mortgaging its Mileage Plus frequent flyer program, its latest effort to raise the cash it needs to weather the Covid-19 crisis.

The term loan will come fromand, and it will take seven years to repay. The interest rate was not disclosed. United says between this and an additional $4.5 billion in federal loans for which it expects to be eligible, it estimates it will have $17 billion in cash on hand by the end of September, roughly three times the normal cash it carries.

US air travel is down about 80% compared with a year ago in the most recent estimates, but that indicates some modest rebound in demand for air travel from earlier this spring, when United and other carriers reported air travel demand was ""virtually zero.""

Demand bottomed out on April 14, when only 87,500 people passed through TSA checkpoints at US airports. By comparison, that number topped more than 500,000 a day this past Thursday, Friday and Sunday — levels not seen since late March

estimates the value of its Mileage Plus program as a standalone business at $20 billion. It gets revenue from partners who pay the airline to award miles to their own customers, such as credit card issues and hotels. It had sales of $5.3 billion last year, about 12% of United's overall revenue.

While those sales are down during the current crisis with overall drop in travel and consumer spending, they have held up better than the airline's passenger revenue -- which has nearly evaporated.

United said the loan should not have any effect on its 100 million Mileage Plus members, nor will it reduce the airline's control over the terms of the program.

Modest improvement in demand

American Airlines AAL Meanwhile, United is still planning for only a modest improvement in demand for air travel with its July flight schedule down 75% from a year ago. That's an improvement from the airline's 85% reduction in June -- but it's a much lighter schedule than that of rival, which expects to fly 55% of its year-ago capacity in July.

United plans to resume more than 140 routes it had suspended this spring. And it is filling about 60% of the available seats on domestic flights with paying passengers in June, up from 39% in May and only 13% in April.

Filling that many more seats makes it more difficult to have the empty seats needed for social distancing. United said it will notify passengers when it expects a flight to be more than 70% full and will allow those passengers to rebook. But its executives admit it needs to do more to give passengers assurances that it is safe to fly.

United has a touchless check-in procedure. Flight attendants pass out sanitizing wipes, and passengers, who are requested to wear masks, board from the rear of the plane to the front to limit contact among them.

There's more behind the scenes. Employees are checked for fevers when they start a shift. Common surfaces like seats and tray tables are wiped down. The entire aircraft is sprayed to disinfect it — a process that takes about 10 minutes for a 787 jet.

""We're trying to do everything we can to instill confidence in the travel experience,"" the manager of United's Dulles hub, Omar Idrism, said.

But even with 60% of the seats filled, it's far below what is needed for the airline to be profitable. Last year, United filled 84% of the seats with paying passengers throughout the course of the year.

Because of cheaper fares and fewer seats sold, United expects passenger revenue will be down even more in July -- off between 82% and 88%. But that too is an improvement from the second quarter so far. United began the current period with a 98% drop in revenue in April and expects June's decline to be 90%.

Frequent flyer loan is the first of its kind

While this isn't the first time an airline has monetized the value of its frequent flyer program, the details of this United deal are different, the airline's executives told journalists on a conference call.

Previous frequent flyer-linked deals involved less favorable terms -- like airlines giving up some measure of control over their operations, or discounting prepaid miles purchases which raised billions but limited the cash flow for the airline in the future. What makes this loan unique is that neither was the case this time.

""We expect many of our competitors to imitate it,"" said a United senior executive on the call, who spoke on the condition of not being identified by name. ""There are many examples of United to be first to take aggressive steps [to deal with the crisis], and this is another example of that.""

United said it believes these kinds of loans could become a common way for airlines to raise cash from its frequent flyer programs in the future, even beyond the current crisis.

""Even in the best of times this is a facility we'll have some interest in using,"" said the United executive.

Kathryn Vasel,Do you feel like you belong at work?,"Editor's Note: A version of this story appeared in CNN's Work Transformed newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here .

Be honest: How much do you feel like you belong at work?

It might sound like an odd question, but the answer is important.

Feeling like you're part of the team and you're being seen and supported at work is a big part of being happy in your career, reports CNN Business' Jeanne Sahadi. Employees that have a sense of belonging are more likely to stay and succeed -- which is good news for employers.

But a new study found that White workers report a higher sense of belonging than their Black, Hispanic and Asian colleagues.

""Employees who belong to groups that have not traditionally been represented in the workplace step into their careers at a disadvantage, and begin a journey riddled with reminders that they're outside the norm; that they are 'other,'"" the report notes.

So what can employers do to help promote a better sense of belonging?

To start, they should proactively and regularly check in with employees given all the stresses of the world right now, Sahadi writes. The key is to listen to their concerns and identify ways you can help address some of the worries.

Providing regular feedback is also important -- this allows workers a chance to adjust their performance to meet expectations. But it needs to be honest and specific in order to be helpful.

Increasing accessibility to senior leaders can also lead to a better sense of belonging in the workplace.

Saving more American jobs

Here's a title that no country wants: Home of the largest increase in unemployment of any major economy.

But here we are.

And now it's time for Congress to act in order to restore and preserve US jobs, writes Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics; Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and Antonio Weiss, a research fellow at Harvard Kennedy School's Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government, for CNN Business' Perspectives.

The coronavirus is a worldwide problem, but other countries, like Germany and Australia, have employee retention programs that have kept a lid on unemployment rates, they note.

The plans provide government funding to companies in order to keep employees on the payroll during times of economic uncertainty. They help families make ends meet and also put less stress on the country's unemployment insurance system.

Additionally, having workers stay connected to their employers can lead to a smoother and stronger recovery, according to the trio.

But there could be some drawbacks to retention programs if they remain in place too long, including higher unemployment and lower economic growth. And, of course, there is also the cost to consider.

Don't hold your breath

It's going to be a long time before we see unemployment fall back to pre-pandemic levels.

In February, the unemployment rate was 3.5%. The Congressional Budget Office said last week that it estimates the rate will remain well above that level until after 2030.

What's more, the 10-year average unemployment rate is projected to be 6.1%, a big increase from the 4.2% rate that was predicted in January, reports CNN Business' Anneken Tappe.

But given that so much is still unknown, including shifts in consumer behavior (what changes will stick and what are temporary?) and even the virus itself (how and when will it go away?) the agency warned the forecast hinges on a lot of uncertainty.

Generation Z's rough entry into working life

Internships. First jobs. Gearing up for college.

For many Gen Z'ers, this was supposed to be a big summer.

But then the pandemic hit. And everyone's plans came to a screeching halt.

The pain of the Covid Recession is widespread, but for the younger generation, the scars are going to run deep.

Members of Gen Z had the potential to narrow the inequality gap in America, writes CNN Business' Jazmin Goodwin. Their earning potential was promising, and the labor market was tight, resulting in companies widening their applicant pools. All good news for young job seekers and closing the economic disparity gap.

Oh what a difference a few months can make.

Now, Gen Z'ers could face a permanent decline in earnings. And Black youth could be hit particularly hard. This group faces higher unemployment and often earns less than their White peers with the same levels of education, reports Goodwin.

And while the current economic climate can be detrimental to all young workers, it's even harder for young Black workers to overcome.

Alexis Benveniste,Elon Musk's brother wants to transform farming,"New York (CNN Business) Plant-based foods are all the rage right now, and vertical farms are capitalizing on the trend.

Vertical farming is an indoor farming method in which crops are grown in stacked layers, often without soil. The practice is becoming more popular and important as urban populations grow dramatically and available farmland decreases.

While vertical farming isn't a new concept, these eco-friendly indoor farms are now rapidly expanding.

Elon Musk's younger brother, Kimbal Musk , who was named ""Global Social Entrepreneur"" of the year by the World Economic Forum in 2017, started Square Roots, an indoor urban farming company based in Brooklyn, in 2016. Square Roots' mission is to bring fresh, local food to cities around the world by empowering younger generations to participate in urban farming.

""When I was a kid, the only way I could get my family to sit down and connect was by cooking the meal,"" Musk, co-founder and executive chairman of Square Roots, told CNN Business in an email.

Kimbal Musk teaches students how to plant a vegetable garden in California.

""Getting involved with the internet, especially in the late 90's, was very exciting and I wouldn't change anything about those experiences, but my passion has always been food,"" Musk said. ""The moment Elon and I sold Zip2, our first internet company, I knew I wanted to pursue food and become a trained chef."" He moved to New York and enrolled at the International Culinary Center.

Musk said the company plans to open a Square Roots ""Super Farm"" — with 25 climate-controlled shipping containers, cold storage, biosecurity infrastructure and everything else needed to run a vertical farm at scale — in less than three months.

Since its inception, Square Roots has grown more than 120 varieties of crops, including greens, vegetables and strawberries.

The company isn't the first of its kind. Startups like Silicon Valley's Plenty, which was founded in 2013 and is backed by Jeff Bezos, are also beginning to dominate the space.

""Environmentalists, urban farmers, architects, agronomists, and public health experts, among others, have been joining this mini revolution as they partner to work out a way to salvage a food-scarce, ultra-urbanized future,"" Kheir Al-Kodmany, a professor of sustainable urban design at the University of Illinois at Chicago, said in a report.

It involves various techniques, such as hydroponics, which uses mineral nutrient solutions in a water solvent; aquaponics, which uses aquatic creatures -- such as fish and snails -- and cultivates plants in water; and aeroponics, which grows plants in the air.

As for job creation, rapid climate change will put millions of traditional farmers out of business, but vertical farmers won't be affected, according to microbiologist Dickson Despommier, an emeritus professor of public and environmental health at Columbia University.

Although vertical farming was first introduced in the early 1900s, it was recently popularized by Despommier. More than 20 years ago, he began teaching a class at Columbia called Medical Ecology.

Despommier spent a decade growing crops indoors with his students. ""Ten years ago, there were no vertical farms,"" he said, noting that LED grow lights have vastly improved farming efficiency over the last five years, making indoor growing cheaper and more reliable.

Basil growing at the Square Roots farm in Brooklyn.

""People want local food because they've lost trust in the industrial food system that ships in high calorie, low nutrient food from thousands of miles away with little transparency as to who grew the food and how,"" said Peggs, the Square Roots CEO.

At the same time, the world population is growing and urbanizing rapidly. Peggs said climate change is threatening existing supplies of food, forcing the industry to figure out new ways to grow food quickly.

Peggs is optimistic about raising money for vertical farming. ""A lot of smart money and capital is entering the space,"" he said. ""The quality of food that can now be produced in these indoor systems is at least on par with the best organic field grown food you can buy.""

Despommier said that cities will eventually be able to grow ""all they can eat"" from indoor farms located within city limits. ""If an outdoor farm fails, the farmer has to wait until next year to start again, he said. ""Indoor farms fail too, but the indoor farmer can start again within weeks.""",2020-02-28,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/02/28/business/musk-vertical-farm/index.html
Hanna Ziady,Britain has to solve its heating problem to meet its ambitious climate goals,"London (CNN Business) The United Kingdom made history last year when it became the first major economy to commit to pumping no more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than it removes by 2050.

Dozens of countries have since followed its lead to achieve ""net zero"" emissions, and with three decades to go before the deadline, Britain's progress provides a promising blueprint

Its carbon emissions were 44% below 1990 levels in 2018, with renewable energy now accounting for 33% of its energy mix and coal contributing just over5%. That is thanks in large part to its success with offshore wind and focus on nuclear energy.

But the Committee on Climate Change, an independent advisory body, warns the country must do more to meet its carbon reduction targets for 2023 to 2027. And climate activists say the government should aim for ""net zero"" much sooner than 2050.

Heating homes

By far the biggest threat to the United Kingdom's 2050 ambition comes from the way it heats its homes, schools and hospitals.

More than 80% of homes are connected to the gas grid, according to Ian Radley, head of gas operations at National Grid.

While natural gas emits less carbon than coal, Britain's heavy dependence on the fossil fuel is deemed unsustainable. Heat is responsible for around half of all UK CO2 emissions, according to HyDeploy, a consortium that is currently piloting hydrogen as an alternative to gas.

In other words, the UK government's £1.5 billion ($2 billion) investment into reducing emissions from road transport won't be enough to meet its 2050 target if it doesn't also tackle heating.

""The heating story is the one that usually just gets neglected. It's in the box called 'too difficult,'"" Dieter Helm, professor of energy policy at Oxford University, told CNN Business. ""How are you going to heat your house and do your cooking without natural gas? The answer to that question is at considerable expense.""

A 2018 report commissioned by the National Infrastructure Commission, a government agency, found that decarbonizing Britain's heating infrastructure could cost as much as £450 billion ($586 billion).

The total cost of decarbonization could exceed £1 trillion ($1.3 trillion), according to the Committee on Climate Change.

Among the proposed solutions to the domestic heating challenge: stop connecting new homes to the gas grid, while encouraging existing homeowners to move to energy efficient alternatives such as hydrogen boilers.

Repurposing existing infrastructure will be critical. HyDeploy is conducting experiments at the University of Keele to establish how much hydrogen can be blended into the national grid as a replacement to gas, without people needing to buy new heating or cooking appliances. Hydrogen offers many of the benefits of natural gas, without the carbon emissions.

Production versus consumption

For Helm, even if the United Kingdom achieves its target in terms of power production, consumption is what ultimately matters.

""If we reduce carbon emissions in Britain but simply close down our large industries and import the stuff from China instead, then global warming will be worse off,"" Helm said. ""The thing about carbon is it doesn't matter where it's emitted,"" he added, arguing that a carbon border tax is the only way to encourage all countries to decarbonize and ensure that ""the polluter pays wherever the polluter is.""

Carbon pricing mechanisms were discussed at December's UN climate summit in Madrid, but no agreement was reached on how to create a global carbon market where, for example, countries could trade greenhouse gas emission credits.

made by major economies will be scrutinized, particularly following the The United Kingdom will host this year's summit in Glasgow in November, and the progressmade by major economies will be scrutinized, particularly following the disappointing outcome in Madrid.

The United Kingdom must have ""made credible plans"" to meet its 2050 target by then, according to Chris Stark, CEO of the Committee on Climate Change.

""The next 12 months are likely to be the most important yet in defining the UK's climate credentials,"" Stark wrote in a recent blog post.

Story Nathaniel Meyersohn,"Dollar General is cheap, popular and spreading across America. It's also a robbery magnet, police say","In the year before Dave Dukes killed a man who was trying to rob the store where he worked, he'd witnessed three other robberies.

After each of them, Dukes, 28, would say later, he'd asked his supervisors at Dollar General to put in a security guard.

But, according to Dukes, his bosses didn't do that — though, because of how many robberies he'd been through, they did start sending him out to train employees at other stores.

After the third robbery, Dukes started bringing a gun to work.

Then, in October 2019, the fourth robbery happened.

According to the local prosecutor's office, a man entered the store with a gun and demanded money from the cashier. When Dukes tried to intervene, the man — Roosevelt Rappley, just 23 years old — pointed his gun at Dukes. Then Dukes pulled out his own gun and shot Rappley, killing him.

A grand jury in Ohio reviewed the case and found Dukes ""acted lawfully under the circumstances,"" according to the prosecutor's office.

But by then Dukes was out of a job, allegedly having been fired by Dollar General for violating company policy. Dollar General's 2019 policy said that possession of a firearm on the company premises may result in termination.

Dave Dukes stands in his lawyer's office in Dayton, Ohio in March. Dukes was a Dollar General clerk who shot and killed a man during an armed robbery. It was the fourth robbery he had witnessed on the job.

Dollar General declined to say why Dukes was terminated, saying in an email that it does not comment publicly on specific employment situations. The company said it does not retaliate ""against employees who make good faith reports of safety concerns."" It also maintains that the safety of its employees is a top priority.

Rappley's family is still trying to process his death eight months after the robbery. Rappley's sister Jasmine Jessery said in an interview that she didn't hold a grudge toward Dukes. ""He was protecting himself,"" she said.

Jessery described her brother as a kind person who had linked up with the wrong crowd. ""Everything went sour"" then, she said.

A thriving business

Business is booming at Dollar General, the chain adding more stores every year than any other retailer in America. That was the case even before the coronavirus pandemic, but Dollar General has been in an even stronger position during the pandemic as price-conscious consumers stock up on essential items.

Former executives, store employees, law enforcement officials and retail security experts told CNN Business that while the company's low-cost, no-frills model might be embraced by Wall Street, it is putting its workers at risk.

Dollar General stores, which process a high number of cash transactions, are a prime target for armed robberies, they said. Some of the former company officials and current and former employees spoke on the condition of anonymity either to discuss internal conversations or for fear that speaking out would impact their jobs.

Dark side of a booming business At a time when other retailers are struggling, Dollar General is thriving. The company plans to add 1,000 stores in 2020.

Meanwhile, insiders and security experts say the company is failing to protect workers from violent crime.

In Dayton, Ohio, seven Dollar General stores accounted for 29% of commercial robberies in 2019. Police say they had repeatedly recommended stores improve security measures.

At least six Dollar General employees have died during robberies since 2016, according to a review of news and police reports.

""Every night I was just waiting for there to be a phone call that said, 'Hey we've lost somebody,'"" Brian Flannery, who oversaw security at around 2,000 Dollar General stores in the northeast as a divisional loss prevention director from 2011 to 2015, said. ""It wasn't a matter there [of] if you were going to have a bad robbery. It was a matter of when.""

At least six Dollar General employees have died during robberies since 2016, according to a review of news and police reports. And while the FBI doesn't specifically track robberies at dollar stores as it does those which occur at convenience stores and gas stations — other robbery targets — police have warned company managers that its stores are vulnerable.

In a statement in response to this story, Dollar General said, ""We employ a number of measures designed to create and maintain a safe work environment for our employees and a safe shopping environment for our customers, all while protecting company assets.""

The company said its safety and security measures take federal and state laws, retail industry standards and law enforcement recommendations into account and its measures are ""designed to prevent, deter and if necessary, respond to criminal activity in our stores.""

""Our employees are our greatest asset. Their safety and security is of paramount importance,"" Dollar General added.

The problem of robberies isn't exclusive to Dollar General. In an interview with CNN Business, Jason Hall, a lieutenant with the Dayton Police Department, described local dollar stores as ""robbery magnets.""

He has tracked robberies at local chains including Dollar Tree, Family Dollar and Dollar General over the last few years — and Dollar General, by far, had the most incidents.

Lieutenant Jason Hall, photographed in March, says the Dayton Police Department repeatedly made security recommendations to dollar stores in the area but many of those recommendations were ignored.

In Dayton alone, police were called to 86 robberies at just seven Dollar General stores between 2016 and 2019. Robberies at Dollar General locations accounted for 29% of the 80 commercial robberies in the city in 2019, according to figures provided by the department.

Dollar General declined to comment on how much it spends annually on crime prevention or any specific measures in its stores to protect workers and prevent robberies ""as to do so potentially compromises the integrity of those measures, provides a roadmap to would-be wrongdoers and may place customers and employees at risk.""

Growing at a price

As other retailers have struggled in recent years, dollar stores have enjoyed breakneck growth. The Great Recession, slow wage growth and widening inequality in America had all boosted discount retailers. Now the pandemic is as well.

The two largest players are Dollar General and Dollar Tree, which bought Family Dollar in 2015.

There are a few differences between the chains. At Dollar Tree, for example, all items are exactly $1 . The stores tend to be in middle-class suburban areas.

Dollar General's more than 16,000 stores, on the other hand, sell items largely in the $1 to $10 range, meaning there is more cash in registers. That makes stores more susceptible to robberies, according to retail security experts.

""We do very good in good times and we do fabulous in bad times,"" Vasos said on a call with Wall Street analysts in May. ""We're very, very bullish on what post-Covid looks like because...I think we're very well positioned no matter what this economy does to both our core customer and to the customer overall.""

We do very good in good times and we do fabulous in bad times."" Todd Vasos, CEO, Dollar General

Investors like Dollar General because it's been relentless at making more with less: less real estate, less labor and smaller product sizes than its larger big-box competitors. In its latest fiscal year, Walmart's US stores had a 5.1% operating profit margin before taxes; Dollar General stores boasted an 8.3% margin — an indicator that Dollar General is more efficient at keeping costs low and turning sales into profits.

Since 2010 , Dollar General's annual profits have increased five-fold and its stock has surged more than 800%. Its locations have nearly doubled, and now the chain boasts more US stores than Walmart, Kroger, Costco and Home Depot combined. A record 25,000 retail stores are expected to close this year, but Dollar General still plans to open 1,000 new locations in 2020 , or roughly 20 new stores a week.

But the company's low-cost approach often comes at the expense of employees, former executives said. Efforts to keep costs down have also kept the company's leadership from wanting to take bigger steps on security, these executives said.

Visibility inside the stores is often poor for workers because of the design, according to law enforcement officials. Stores tend to be small and crowded, with high shelves and piles of boxes and carts lining the aisles. Some police patrolling outside complain that it's difficult to see inside because windows are covered with advertisements and signs.

Dollar General said in an email that ""we continually review and, as needed, adapt operating procedures and store layout [and] fixturing.""

Staffing is intentionally kept at a minimum, often with just one or two low-wage employees on site at any given time, former executives said. And although store registers are often flush with cash because it's what many customers use to pay, security guards are rarely on the premises.

The Dayton Police Department says in 2017 it recommended Dollar General keep its windows clear as a security precaution. This store on Dayton's Salem Avenue, which was the site of four robberies between 2018 and 2020, had its windows covered as of March 2020.

Security guards were viewed as costly to the company's bottom line, the former executives also said.

One former Dollar General executive described the difficulty in convincing other company leaders that security guards could deliver a positive return on investment. ""We certainly didn't get a return having somebody standing there and paying $10 or $12 an hour,"" the former executive said. ""Out of the 13,000 stores when I was there, probably less than 100 stores had some type of outside security.""

Another of the former Dollar General executives, who focused on security, said he was ""heavily chastised"" for frequently going over budget on monthly guard expenses.

Adding staff to stores would have also jeopardized the low-cost model.

""It's a low margin business, so you have to have low labor [costs] to make a profit,"" said one of the former executives. ""Putting more labor in the stores took away from the profit, or you have to raise prices. And there was no appetite to raise prices because it's a low-price business.""

The company has invested in interactive security monitoring services. At thousands of stores in higher-crime neighborhoods or that have experienced frequent incidents, cameras are monitored by offsite security agents. The agents can communicate with employees in the store and make public announcements over the loudspeakers letting customers know they are on camera.

If the agents see a robbery or suspicious activity at the store, they can alert the local police. There are also two-way phones and panic buttons that employees can press to talk directly with a security agent if they are in distress.

Interface Security Systems, one of the services that Dollar General uses, boasts on its website that its technology helps companies reduce security guard costs by 88%. Dollar General also has used iVerify, another off-site monitoring company. Earlier this year, Securitas Electronic Security acquired the customer contracts of iVerify.

This Dollar General store on N Gettysburg Ave in Dayton is where Dave Dukes said he experienced four robberies in just a year on the job.

The remote monitoring systems can be effective at deterring shoplifting inside the store, according to experts. But unlike human security guards who can act as a visible, physical deterrent, they are less effective at deterring robberies, according to police, former employees at iVerify and Interface, and retail security consultants.

One former iVerify executive said, ""it's rare that you're going to be looking at a video when the robbery occurs."" He said the remote monitoring was better-suited for investigating robberies after they occurred.

Securitas, the company that now owns iVerify's customer contracts, did not respond to request for comment. A representative for Interface said ""there is a place for both remote interactive monitoring and security guards in most retail chains"" and that its interactive remote monitoring systems with live video and two-way audio were a strong crime deterrent.

When robberies do occur, some of the former Dollar General executives said, the company offered reactive, short-term measures — such as adding a security guard to a store for a few weeks.

""It was literally whack-a-mole. You would get the okay to spend cash when there was an incident. A reactive security program in that kind of environment is not what you're looking for,"" said Flannery, the former divisional loss prevention director at Dollar General.

Dollar General said it disagreed with Flannery's characterization of its security efforts and that it doesn't believe ""those assertions are supported by facts.""

The safety concerns take a toll on some workers.

When Kenya Slaughter works the cash register at a Dollar General in Alexandria, Louisiana, she makes sure she has enough $1 and $10 bills in the drawer, so she won't have to go back into the safe. When she has to take out money from the safe behind the register, she ""strategically positions herself"" so she's not opening it with her back turned.

Still, potential robbers ""know we don't have security and that people are in there alone,"" she said.

Indeed, Dollar General employees told NBC News in a report last month that they've been stabbed, shot and held at gunpoint.

Significant 'shrink'

In recent years, Dollar General has focused on solving another problem.

Current and former staffers said there was an intense urgency to combat ""shrink"" — or merchandise lost due to shoplifting, employee theft or inventory errors. In its latest annual report filed in March , Dollar General called the problem ""significant,"" noting that ""higher rates of inventory shrinkage or increased security or other costs to combat inventory theft could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.""

The sources said they felt that the company prioritized reducing ""shrink"" over preventing robberies, which had a human toll.

""In the two years I sat in the executive meetings, I never remember anybody bringing up armed robberies as a problem. We talked about loss of product and store manager turnover,"" said one former top Dollar General executive. ""The people that are below the store manager level are just a commodity.""

The obsession with reducing shrink was often turned inward, with Dollar General treating some of its own workers with constant suspicion, said Tracy Vargas, an assistant professor of sociology and criminal justice at the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. Vargas worked as a clerk at Dollar General in 2014 and 2015 for her PhD dissertation on dollar stores at Syracuse University. She also interviewed 50 employees from across the country. In her dissertation, she described workers being treated like criminals with surveillance cameras often focused on their activities rather than on customers.

The people that are below the store manager level are just a commodity."" A former Dollar General executive

Dollar General said its ""understanding is that Ms. Vargas's employment with the company was intended solely to validate her preconceived notions regarding the company for purposes of a book that she was writing, rather than in furtherance of serving the customers and communities that rely on us.""

It added: ""We categorically deny the assertions.""

A 13-foot poster in the store backroom, known as the Shrink Chart, displayed performance statistics including the number of times each employee voided cash register transactions that week, Vargas said. (A large number of voided transactions or price checks could be interpreted by managers as a sign of employee theft.)

Meanwhile, Dollar General provides little training on how to handle robberies, sources told CNN Business.

Former store workers, including Dukes and Vargas, described when they were first hired being shown a simulation video of a robbery. There are no hands-on drills and they did not have to review the video annually, some of these sources said. In some stores, signs are posted in back rooms giving employees directions on what to do ""should the unlikely event of robbery occur.""

Vargas told CNN Business that Dollar General employees are ""sitting ducks"" and ""considered to be profit risks to the corporation's bottom line.""

""Employees are alone, exposed, and at the mercy of whomever [decides] to walk through the door that day,"" she said.

Law enforcement raises concerns

In some cities, local officials have urged Dollar General management to take more steps to prevent violent crime. They say their warnings have largely gone ignored.

Dayton police have prepared reports on crime at local Dollar General, Dollar Tree and Family Dollar stores. On February 1, 2017, members of the department presented a Dollar General divisional loss prevention director with a 32-slide PowerPoint deck detailing the factors the department believes to be ""enabling factors"" in robberies. The factors included blocked windows, high shelves, lack of maintenance outside the stores and lack of security guards in high-incident locations.

It's a ""fairly large issue for us,"" Hall, the Dayton Police Department lieutenant, told CNN Business. ""We've made a lot of recommendations to try to improve these situations. We have noticed that not many of these recommendations have been implemented or fully implemented.""

Dollar General said it ""enjoys frequent communication with the Dayton Police Department"" and that it implemented the department's exterior maintenance suggestions in 2017. The company claimed the department did not provide ""specific store safety and security measures.""

A representative for Dollar Tree, which owns Family Dollar, said ""working with and supporting local law enforcement is absolutely important to us. We continually refine our security program, which includes cooperating with local police departments to share photos and videos to support their investigations.""

In St. Louis, where there have been ""high calls for police service for larcenies, disturbances [and] hold-ups"" at Dollar General and Family Dollar in recent years, ""implementing security is often suggested and ignored,"" said Rich Sykora, an attorney for the city of St. Louis.

Lt. Hall described robberies at local dollar stores as a ""fairly large issue"" in the area. Seven Dollar General locations accounted for 29% of robberies at Dayton businesses in 2019, according to the department's data.

""We will take a fresh look at the St. Louis market and implement the appropriate steps,"" a Dollar Tree representative responded.

In rural Effingham County, Georgia, Sheriff Jimmy McDuffie said three of the five Dollar General stores in the area have been hit in recent years. ""We don't call them dollar stores. We call them stop and robs,"" he said.

McDuffie presented a list of safety concerns to Dollar General stores in the county, he said, including recommendations to improve lighting and limit the number of boxes piled up inside the stores, which can make it difficult for officers to see inside. ""Put in some security measures,"" he urged. ""Light the parking lots up.""

""They say they're going to do better, but it doesn't seem to come to fruition,"" he told CNN Business.

And in the Pee Dee region of South Carolina, there have been a string of robberies at Dollar General stores over the past year.

""None of the stores have added outside cameras that could potentially capture the mode of transportation and the direction of travel for suspects,"" said Tammy Erwin, a deputy at the Marion County Sheriff's Office in South Carolina.

""There are no security officers at any time. There are shifts with only one employee working in the entire store,"" she said. She added that she wonders why Dollar General won't implement ""a buddy-system of employees, so that no one is alone in the store.""

We don't call them dollar stores. We call them stop and robs."" Jimmy McDuffie, Sheriff, Effingham County, Georgia

Dollar General's 2019 handbook of operating procedures says ""at a minimum, two employees must be involved in the closing process. For safety purposes, always use the buddy system."" But there is no mention of similar policy for opening stores in the morning or at other hours of the day. The company says it ""tries to minimize the time that employees are alone in the store.""

The company said it has received ""no formal safety and security policy change"" from the sheriff's offices in Effingham County, Georgia, and Marion County, South Carolina.

Dollar General said it was ""aware of a single request from a member of law enforcement in St. Louis,"" who requested that Dollar General implement facial recognition software from a company ""in which we understood the individual to have a personal and financial interest.""

Deaths on the job

Family members of Dollar General employees killed during armed robberies and security experts say it's not just a lack of in-store security measures that are the problem.

Out of the six Dollar General employees killed since 2016, two were shot as they left stores to deposit cash from the register at the bank.

Some Dollar General employees take cash deposits to the bank by themselves: The company's policy in its 2019 store operating procedures says that stores should make one or two such deposits each day depending on their location, and that the deposits can only be made by ""key carriers,"" or high-ranking employees.

Ron Holder took a job as a store manager at a Dollar General in Richmond, Virginia, and hoped to work his way up the ranks at the company and become a district manager. But he was killed in his car outside of Dollar General one morning after picking up a cash deposit from the store, according to the FBI . His case is still unsolved.

In Houston, 20-year-old DeQuan Anderson was killed in 2017 as he got in his car to bring cash from the store to the bank. His mother, Janine, has filed a wrongful death lawsuit. The case has gone to arbitration.

Janine Anderson described her son in an interview as ""an all-around good kid"" who was active in his church and developed a love of photography in high school. He saved up money to buy a camera and equipment and took it everywhere he went.

""He always was going to have some type of career in art,"" she said. ""That was his passion.""

Before his death, DeQuan had raised concerns about the bank-drop process on multiple occasions, the lawsuit said. But despite previous robberies at the store, Dollar General did not increase its security or hire an outside security company to transport cash to the bank, the lawsuit alleges.

Dollar General declined to comment on pending litigation.

Meanwhile, Dukes, the former Dollar General employee in Dayton, Ohio, is trying to bounce back after the October robbery that changed his life. He has had trouble finding work after the shooting. He is hoping to be more present in his kids' lives.

""I don't regret anything that I did,"" he said. He was defending himself, he said.

But Dukes believes the robbery could have been avoided if Dollar General had taken his advice and put in permanent armed security. He hopes company executives will start doing more to protect their employees.

""They don't know what's going on inside these stores every day. They don't. Store managers are the ones that deal with that every day. But I would tell them that they need to take better care of their staff.""",2020-06-26,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/26/business/dollar-general-robberies/index.html
Danielle Wiener-Bronner,Why restaurant menus are getting shorter,"New York (CNN Business) Restaurants are reducing their menus to streamline their operations amid the coronavirus pandemic .

The industry has been hit hard by efforts to stop the spread of Covid-19. From March to May, eating and drinking place sales were $94 billion below expected levels, according to a recent survey by the National Restaurant Association. Reopening will be difficult as well. The slimmer menus are a way to shed complexities and costs, and push simpler or more popular items at a time when conserving cash is crucial for restaurant operators.

Here's what is off the menu

removed dishes like the Sizzlin' Supreme Skillet, Choconana Pancakes, Spicy Sriracha Burger, Fit Slam and Slow-Cooked Pot Roast from its dine-in menu through fall. ""When we realized the effects of the pandemic we quickly mobilized to create a new streamlined menu,"" said John Dillon, Denny's chief brand officer, in a statement emailed to CNN Business. Denny's, which still has plenty of options, is serving items that ""simplify operations and [are] easier to execute for our team members,"" he said.

IHOP used to have a 12-page menu. Now it's giving guests a 2-page, disposable menu. The shift ""required a lot of reductions,"" Brad Haley, IHOP's chief marketing officer, told CNN Business. IHOP held on to popular items that weren't too difficult to prepare. It lost complicated items that fewer guests ordered, and that could be replaced with something similar.

One example: a Simple and Fit omelet made with egg whites and spinach. While the specific dish is no longer on the menu, customers can build their own omelet using the same ingredients. ""We didn't lose any big menu categories, we just trimmed across the board,"" Haley said. A smaller menu makes it easier for IHOP to train new workers as it reopens. It also means less waste for franchise operators, who may throw out unused ingredients they buy for less popular menu items.

""I don't see us going back to the full 12-page menu,"" Haley said.

Dave & Buster's PLAY reduced its 40-item menu to 15 offerings, CEO Brian Jenkins said during a recent analyst call discussing the company's first quarter financial results. ""I do not expect that we will go back to the 40-item menu,"" he said.

McDonald's MCD ""transitioned to a limited menu in April,"" the company said in a statement to CNN Business, adding that ""this decision helped simplify operations for our restaurant crew while also improving our customers' experience.""

planning to this summer bring back a handful of the discontinued items. The chain axed salads, bagels, yogurt parfaits and all-day breakfast during the crisis, the Wall Street Journal reported . The company isplanning to this summer bring back a handful of the discontinued items.

out, restaurants have to reduce their capacities and keep people far enough apart to satisfy social distancing rules. Restaurant operators are in a tough spot. For months, their dining rooms were closed because of local social-distancing orders. Now, as many start to reopen their doors, they face uncertain territory. With unemployment so high , some people may decide that eating out is just too expensive. Others may be afraid to come into restaurants, where they worry they could get sick from staff or other customers . Even if diners are eager to goout, restaurants have to reduce their capacities and keep people far enough apart to satisfy social distancing rules.

Meanwhile, their costs are soaring. Restaurant operators have to pay for personal protective equipment for workers, lots of hand sanitizer, paper towels, contact-free payment systems and more. They may have to pay to redesign their dining rooms . And the cost of some ingredients, like meat , is way up.

Reducing menus could help. And, at least for now, customers don't seem to mind.

The problem with raising prices

Restaurants already operate with very thin margins, so it's difficult for them to absorb costs without making any changes.

One obvious way to cope with higher costs is by passing them on to customers via higher prices. But diners won't stand for it.

""What restaurants really hate is adding fees and doing things that frustrate the customer,"" said Sean Kennedy, the National Restaurant Association's Executive Vice President for Public Affairs.

If customers see prices go up, they may turn to a competitor. Or they might just eat at home.

""There's a lot of options outside of restaurant meals,"" said Tim Powell, a managing principal of Foodservice IP, a foodservice consulting firm. ""If you start raising prices it means that there's a good chance that demand, or the traffic, will go down.""

While some restaurants have reportedly started adding so-called Covid surcharges to bills, US food costs away from home went up just 0.4% from April to May, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Less is more

Shrinking the menu is a better option. It allows restaurants to order ingredients in bulk and achieve better economies of scale. And because restaurants remove their least popular or more expensive items, the changes may impact a relatively small number of customers.

At Dave & Buster's for example, ""the 15 items we selected generate a significant portion of our food revenue,"" CEO Jenkins explained.

Even before the pandemic hit, restaurants would sometimes trim their menus to reduce costs or increase efficiencies. ""We tend to go in and out of those phases,"" said Powell, the food consultant. Last year, McDonald's reduced its late-night menu and abandoned its craft burgers to help speed up its service and make its menus less complex.

And while some customers may miss seeing their favorite dish on the menu, others may be happy with — or at least tolerant of — the changes.

At McDonald's, the newly reduced menu has improved customer satisfaction scores ""significantly,"" said Mark Salebra, chair of the McDonald's National Franchisee Leadership Alliance in a statement provided by a company spokesperson.

Plus, some diners may not care that much about variety right now.

Denny's ""customers have been extremely understanding of the adjustments we've made,"" said Dillon, adding ""we've found our guests are appreciative of the focus we have been putting on safety, cleanliness and sanitation that a slightly smaller menu enables.""

IHOP's Haley put it this way: ""we're not seeing complaints from guests.""",2020-06-23,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/23/business/restaurant-menus-shrinking/index.html
Parija Kavilanz,Got these brands in your closet?

If you're looking to make some cash on clothing resale platforms, check your closet for brands that have the best resale value.

Reworn clothing is a growing market that is expected to reach $64 billion in sales by 2024 from current sales of $28 billion, according to a new joint annual industry report from ThredUp, the world's largest online thrift and consignment platform, and research and analytics firm GlobalData.

According to the report, 62 million women purchased secondhand in 2019, up from 56 million women in 2018. And just this year alone, the online secondhand marketplace is expected to grow 27%, while the broader retail sector is expected to shrink by 23%, the report showed.

James Griffiths,How a Long Island man ended up in a Chinese prison on espionage charges,"Hong Kong (CNN) Driving from their home in New York to Cambridge, Massachusetts, Harrison Li had no idea it would be the last time he saw his father for more than a decade.

It was the summer of 2016, and Li was about to resume his studies at Harvard. After dropping him off, his father returned to Long Island, where he was making final preparations for his own trip to Shanghai.

""We had no inkling anything like this was going to happen,"" the younger Li said.

Kai Li was born in Shanghai, and he was returning to the city for a ceremony to mark the one-year anniversary of his mother's death. However when his plane landed, he was met not by his family, but state security agents -- beginning a years-long ordeal that resulted, in July 2018, in him being sentenced to 10 years in prison for espionage.

The Li family maintains that the charges are trumped up and politically motivated. The case, which was held behind closed doors and has not been widely publicized, revolves around supposed state secrets that Li and his lawyer argue are freely available online, as well as communications with the United States government that are routine for people doing cross-border business.

In a letter to President Donald Trump in January, multiple US lawmakers denounced Li's ""arbitrary detention"" and urged Washington to do more to lobby for his release.

China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not respond to a faxed request for comment from CNN on the case.

Political prosecution

Kai Li appeared to be an American success story. Born in Shanghai in 1962, he emigrated to the US aged 27 to study, and later became an American citizen. A natural entrepreneur, he opened two gas stations on Long Island and also a export business, serving as a wholesale buyer and distributor of solar cells and related technologies for major US aerospace firms. China is among the largest manufacturers of solar equipment in the world.

For his export business, Li regularly traveled to the country to meet with clients, as well as to visit his extended family.

""My father would visit China a couple of times a year, for two or three weeks at a time,"" Harrison Li said. ""He's been doing that for 20-plus years.""

Prior to being detained by state security at the airport in Shanghai, Harrison Li said the family had no idea anything might be amiss. While the motivation behind the case is unclear, Kai Li has since suggested to his son that it could have been prompted by a business rival seeking to get him in trouble with the authorities.

China's justice system is particularly opaque -- especially when it comes to cases regarding state security. No details about Li's case have been published in China, either by the court or state media. Li's eventual trial was held behind closed doors, without US officials present.

For two months, Li was held in residential surveillance at a designated location , an extralegal system a panel of United Nations human rights experts has described as ""tantamount to enforced disappearance,"" which exposes detainees ""to the risk of torture and other inhuman and degrading treatment and other human rights violations.""

During that time, US consular officials alerted Li's family to his situation. According to US lawmakers and Li's family, he was denied access to a lawyer during his initial detention.

Following this, he was moved to another detention center while awaiting charges. There he was held in a small cell, without a bed, forced to sleep on the floor, fed little, and interrogated at all hours, Harrison Li said. Eventually, he was transferred to a regular prison and charged with furnishing Chinese state secrets to the FBI. His family maintains that normal business actions by Li have been ""grossly mischaracterized by Chinese authorities as espionage for political leverage.""

According to the US Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC) , the trial against Li, in July 2018, took place in secret, and was over within an hour. US diplomats were prevented from attending, the CECC and Harrison Li said.

Kai Li was eventually sentenced to 10 years in prison, and moved to Shanghai's Qingpu prison.

Dire conditions

A futuristic-looking complex located in the far west of the city, Qingpu prison is one of the main detention centers for foreigners in China. Its website describes it as ""window to showcase China's rule of law.""

Briton Peter Humphrey, who was held in Qingpu after his 2014 conviction on contested illegal information gathering charges , said that ""from the moon, Qingpu Prison would look like a peaceful walled university campus with dorms, gardens, camphor trees, a soccer pitch and a parade ground.""

""From my level, there were a dozen concrete cell blocks with barred windows, a prison theatre, an office block, a kitchen, a boiler house and a factory,"" Humphrey wrote in 2018 , following his release. ""The perimeter wall bristled with razor wire and was patrolled by armed PAP (people's armed police) guards. It could hold 5,000-6,000 prisoners. It also 'trained' prisoners for redistribution to other prisons.""

The prison made international headlines last year, when a British school girl found a message from inmates written inside a Christmas card

""We are foreign prisoners in Shanghai Qingpu prison China,"" the message read. ""Forced to work against our will. Please help us and notify human rights organization.""

The scandal forced supermarket chain Tesco to drop its Chinese supplier, though authorities in the country denied accusations of forced labor.

Humphrey said he regularly witnessed beatings and prisoners being forced to write confessions or being held in solitary confinement. He said he was denied medical treatment for prostate issues, and worried about his health.

Kai Li's health has also suffered, his son said: ""In his last two calls he complained for the first time about issues with his heart, of an irregular heartbeat and occasional numbness in his arm.""

Harrison Li said the prison doctor gave his father a blood pressure test and prescribed him a blood thinner, but would not respond to requests for a more thorough medical examination.

He added that Kai Li is careful in phone calls and letters, reminding his family that they are ""closely monitored.""

Kai Li in 2015 off the Long Island Sound, New York. Born in Shanghai, Li emigrated to the US in 1989 and became an American citizen.

Coronavirus complications

As well as heart issues, Harrison Li said the coronavirus had become a concern for his father in recent months. While it is largely under control in China, prisons have been sites of significant outbreaks in the country and around the world, due to crowded conditions and poor sanitation.

Though so far Kai Li has remained coronavirus free, the pandemic has affected him in other ways.

""The level of nutrition at the prison has gone down significantly,"" the younger Li said. ""There's no longer any fruits or vegetables in the diet or even available for purchase anymore. He asked to be able to get multivitamins, or even to buy them at the commissary, but that has been rejected.""

Harrison Li said the pandemic has also essentially cut Kai Li, and other foreign prisoners, off from the outside world, with no consular visits allowed since the virus began spreading in China in January.

In an email, a US State Department official confirmed this, saying the Chinese government ""suspended all in-person visits to detention centers and prisons on January 23, 2020 in order to reduce the spread of COVID-19.""

""The Department of State has no higher priority than the safety and welfare of US citizens overseas,"" the official added. ""During this suspension, our consular officers have been able to reach most U.S. citizen prisoners serving their sentences in China by phone in lieu of in-person consular visits. The US Mission China team continues to seek access to all persons in custody, and will resume regular in-person visits to detained U.S. citizens in accordance with guidance from health authorities once the Chinese government lifts its restrictions on consular visits.""

Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor have been detained in China on state security charges since 2018.

'Painful ordeal'

In a letter to Trump in February last year, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and other lawmakers urged the President to be a ""vociferous advocate"" for Kai Li's release.

""This painful ordeal has gone on for far too long and caused immeasurable harm to Mr. Li and immense pain for his family in New York,"" the lawmakers wrote.

At that time, negotiations were still progressing towards a US-China trade deal . However since then, relations between the two countries have taken a marked turn for the worse -- particularly since the beginning of the corovanirus pandemic, which the Trump administration has sought to blame on Beijing.

""US-China negotiations seem to be hitting new lows everyday,"" Harrison Li said. He added that it was encouraging to see US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's recent meeting with a top Chinese diplomat in Hawaii , but whether those talks will result in progress remains to be seen.

""As Secretary Pompeo has previously met with the loved ones of many Americans wrongfully detained abroad, I hope to get the opportunity to plead my father's case to him directly in the near future,"" Li added.

Kai Li is the only US citizen held on state security charges. His son compared his case to that of two Canadians, Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig, who were this week officially charged with espionage . The two Canadians were detained in 2018, following the arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver.

""My father is part of a broader pattern of the Chinese government charging foreign citizens on state security charges,"" Harrison Li said. ""It really highlights the danger for Americans looking to do business in China.""

People may see headlines about the two Canadians, he said, but ""this happens to Americans too.""

He fears that danger could soon extend beyond mainland China. The country's parliament, the National People's Congress (NPC), is due to impose a national security law on Hong Kong in the coming weeks , criminalizing separatism, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces.

Carrie Lam, the city's chief executive, has said the law would ensure ""the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong,"" with the proposed bill ""in line with the (city's) rule of law.""

But Harrison Li said it could result in ""political prosecutions.""

""(My father's) detention illustrates that China's national security laws are inherently arbitrary and can be used to exploit foreign citizens for political leverage,"" he said. ""That's something important for Americans to be aware of.""

Rishi Iyengar,Hong Kong was a 'safe harbor' for tech companies shut out of China. Not anymore,"San Francisco (CNN Business) For decades, Silicon Valley giants shut out of China by the country's massive censorship apparatus have continued to operate in Hong Kong thanks to the city's unique political status that guaranteed it a free internet.

But a new law that gives Hong Kong authorities sweeping powers to regulate online content could put those companies on a collision course with that censorship mechanism, known as the Great Firewall — and potentially force them out of Hong Kong altogether.

Under the national security law that went into effect last week, Hong Kong police can demand that online platforms and network providers take down content deemed a threat to China's security or restrict access to their services. If they fail to do so, company representatives could face nearly $13,000 in fines and six months in prison.

That has big implications for tech companies that use the city as a regional base thanks to its relative openness and proximity to China and the Asia Pacific region, even if its approximately 7 million residents don't make up a significant portion of their users.

""It is not a huge market, but is important symbolically,"" said Adam Segal, director of the digital and cyberspace policy program at the Council on Foreign Relations.

Caught in the middle

""Firms would be worried by the impact it has on their users, staff, and executives — as well as global concerns that they would be actively facilitating human rights abuse happening under that framework,"" said Raman Jit Singh Chima, Asia policy director at technology advocacy group Access Now. Chima and other experts say companies are likely to wait and see how far China will go in its crackdown on Hong Kong's internet, but exits from the city remain a possibility.

""They may wait to see if the government makes a request, but then they will be forced to decide, and leaving is likely,"" Segal said.

The vaguely worded law also has a provision that states it would also apply to offenses from outside the region ""by a person who is not a permanent resident,"" potentially giving China the ability to take action against any post against Hong Kong on any platform, anywhere.

""I think that is meant to have a general chilling effect on people everywhere, not just not particularly high tech companies,"" said Scott Kennedy, an expert on China's economic policy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

And while that could lead to a degree of self-censorship overseas, Kennedy says there are questions about China's ability to actually enforce its rules on tech platforms outside its own territory.

""That's something that's a vast overreach by the Chinese, and I think they'd generate more pushback,"" he added.

Facebook, Twitter and Microsoft said they will continue to examine the law and its implications on their businesses.

""Our teams are reviewing the law to assess its implications, particularly as some of the terms of the law are vague and without clear definition,"" a Twitter spokesperson said in a statement.

A Facebook spokesperson said the company would conduct a ""further assessment"" of the law in consultation with human rights experts. ""We believe freedom of expression is a fundamental human right and support the right of people to express themselves without fear for their safety or other repercussions,"" the spokesperson added.

""As we would with any new legislation, we are reviewing the new law to understand its implications,"" a Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement.

Google, which also has operations and users in Hong Kong, did not respond to requests for comment.

Apple AAPL While those three companies are largely cut off from mainland China, the law could also have implications for firms, such asand Microsoft, that have a lot more at stake, according to Steven Feldstein, a nonresident fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Both companies have large manufacturing bases for their hardware products in China, which is also one of the world's biggest markets for iPhones.

""These companies, particularly Apple, are really interesting because they have a lot more to lose, particularly given the amount of hardware that they sell in terms of iPhones as well as their manufacturing,"" Feldstein said. ""I don't know exactly where they're going to end up ... short of a lot of public pressure, it's easy to conceive of a scenario where they try to also muddle their way through.""

Apple has found itself caught between China and Hong Kong in the past, most recently last October when it removed a mapping app from its App Store that the city's pro-democracy protesters were using to track police movements.

The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday, but said in a statement to Bloomberg earlier this week that it was ""assessing"" the law.

Safe harbor

Hong Kong's internet freedom is a product of a 1997 agreement between China and Britain, which handed the territory back to the Chinese government under a principle known as "" one country, two systems "" whereby the city would ""safeguard the rights and freedoms of its residents"" for a period of 50 years. But Beijing has been tightening its grip on those rights and freedoms for several years, and many fear the national security law is another big step in that direction. Several countries including the US UK and Australia have criticized the law, with some warning their citizens against visiting Hong Kong because of it.

""It's clear that the Chinese didn't want to pass it simply to create the illusion that they controlled Hong Kong,"" said Kennedy. ""They really want to control Hong Kong and change the facts on the ground.""

Many tech firms could now be eying an exit, with analysts pointing to Singapore as one of the prime alternatives if they are forced to leave Hong Kong. Many tech firms already have a presence in Singapore, though the Southeast Asian country has its own issues with free speech

""If [Hong Kong is] a regional hub for you, or you're there specifically because of the safe harbor it provides due to rule of law ... it's a challenge for you,"" Kennedy said. ""I wouldn't be surprised If every single [US company in Hong Kong] is considering their options about location, and the same for all of their employees.""

In the meantime, Hong Kong is getting a taste — if not the full impact just yet — of life within the Great Firewall, and companies will be on their guard.

""Even Hong Kong lawyers are unable to provide clear advice or guidelines on what would amount to an offense — the provisions are so broadly crafted that they are capable of capturing even benign conduct such as slogans,"" said Sharron Fast, deputy director of the journalism graduate program at the University of Hong Kong.

""Censorship is coming,"" she added, ""and if the breathtaking pace at which we have seen implementation ... is any indication, it will happen sooner rather than later.""",2020-07-09,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/09/tech/hong-kong-national-security-law-tech-companies/index.html
Brian Fung,TikTok may undergo corporate changes to distance from China amid US scrutiny,"(CNN Business) The short-form video app TikTok could soon see a shakeup of its corporate structure as it confronts mounting criticism from politicians in the US over ties to its Chinese parent company.

TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, is considering establishing a headquarters for the video app outside of China or a new management board to distance the service from the country, according to the Wall Street Journal , citing a source familiar with the matter.

A TikTok spokesperson confirmed Thursday that its parent company is weighing changes to its corporate structure.

""As we consider the best path forward, ByteDance is evaluating changes to the corporate structure of its TikTok business,"" the spokesperson said in a statement provided to CNN Business. ""We remain fully committed to protecting our users' privacy and security as we build a platform that inspires creativity and brings joy for hundreds of millions of people around the world. We will move forward in the best interest of our users, employees, artists, creators, partners, and policymakers.""

US politicians have raised concerns about TikTok as a potential national security risk, claiming that Chinese national security laws could give Beijing access to data on TikTok's American users. President Donald Trump said Tuesday his administration is ""looking at"" banning the app, affirming remarks on Monday by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

Christina Macfarlane,"Wimbledon: 'I absolutely experienced racism in and out of tennis,"" says Mal Washington","(CNN) MaliVai Washington is a ""little sad."" That's because he holds a 24-year record that he never expected to possess for so long -- he's the last African-American man to reach a grand slam final.

On July 7, 1996, Washington strode onto Centre Court beside Dutchman Richard Krajicek for the biggest match of his career: the Wimbledon final.

It was the first time two unseeded players had reached this final, which was also disrupted by an infamous streaker appearance just before the coin toss.

The match itself was over in 94 minutes with Krajicek needing only three sets to dismiss his opponent. But the feeling of being there on that day, on the cusp of history, lingers on for Washington.

""It's distressing. It's unfortunate and a little sad,"" Washington told CNN Sport as he reflected on that 24-year record and that it's also 45 years since a Black American last won Wimbledon.

""I'm surprised that we don't have more Americans, period, on the men's side, but also more Black men who are succeeding at a high level.""

Washington makes a forehand return against Todd Martin during their Wimbledon semifinal in July 1996.

'Like catching lightning in a bottle'

He says people underestimate just how difficult it is for a player of any colour to achieve the feat -- especially in the era of Roger Federer, Rafa Nadal and Novak Djokovic, the sport's Big Three.'

""It's like catching lightning in a bottle,"" says Washington. ""The last American man to reach the final of a major was in 2003, Andy Roddick ... I mean, that just shows you how difficult it is not just for people of colour, but for people in general to reach the final of a major.

""A lot of that has to do with, you know, someone named Federer and Nadal and Djokovic over the past 15 years.""

But it also has a lot to do with what he calls ""the numbers game.""

""A young Black boy who's five years old, 10 years old, can turn on the TV Saturday or Sunday during any college football or pro football season, and he can see a ton of players that look a lot like him. Guess what? That's his guy and that's who he wants to be. That's not necessarily the case at all with tennis on the men's side.""

The 51-year-old knows he was lucky. Like so many other professionals in the game, it was his father who introduced him to tennis at the age of five and instilled in him a work ethic so strong that he and three other siblings went on to play professionally.

But the experience of seeing other players that looked like him succeed, also had an impact, notably Frenchman Yannick Yoah, who won the French Open in 1983.

""I loved a guy like Yannick Noah ... I was asked to warm him up at the US Open when I was still a junior. And I thought it was like the coolest thing in the world.

""But I was worried about screwing it up and nervous I'd turned up at the wrong court. A few minutes before 6 p.m. I saw this sea of people coming towards the court.

""You could see his head and these dreadlocks and hear that French accent above the crowd walking towards me. We exchanged a few words; he said, 'I heard you're a promising young player, good luck.' It was a special moment for me.""

As a teenager, Washington was inspired by French tennis star Yannick Yoah.

'They didn't allow Black players at that particular club'

Not all of it was special. Growing up in a sport that was overwhelmingly White, Washington tried not to let the color of his skin dictate what he could achieve on court, though others did.

""I absolutely experienced racism in tennis and out of tennis. There were times growing up you'd play played [a] junior tournament of multiple age groups and you just kind of knew -- or were told -- you weren't going to play at that particular club. They didn't allow Black players at that particular club.""

But the worst examples of racism came through discrimination in the draw.

""You'll see a draw, 32 players let's say, and three of the players are Black ... And there were times where it was just kind of uncanny how two of the Black players faced each other in the first round, and then if you won, you were going to play the third Black person in the second round.

""And you're just thinking ... all right, it could have just been the luck of the draw? But then when it happens a few times it kind of makes you wonder -- OK, are they fixing the draw just to eliminate the Black players from the draw? I would argue that every Black tennis player at some point has seen that.""

Washington has set up a foundation to help bring tennis to underprivileged urban kids.

'Out of line'

As he progressed up the tennis ladder Washington says he was dealt with ""more integrity."" Even so the top level of tennis wasn't immune with a racial slur or joke occurring here and there.

""There were incidences that happened not ever necessarily with the tournament officials, but maybe someone who's working for the tournament ... various comments or jokes that they thought were kind of funny that I was thinking, all right, that's completely out of line,"" says Washington.

The ATP did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment.

Does he wish he would have said something at the time? ""Yes, I do,"" he replies.

""There's a part of me that wishes I had because it could have been an educational moment right there. But there's also a part of me that also says, you know what? I don't want to spend all my time trying to correct what I perceive as a racially-motivated event. That's not the best use of my time.""

So Washington used his time in a very different way. After reaching the final of Wimbledon -- a moment that would prove to be the summit of his career -- he decided to launch the MaliVai Washington Foundation to help bring tennis to underprivileged urban kids. He didn't need to look far to find the right spot.

""You go into this area of Jacksonville (Florida), the 32209 zip code. You go into that area. The last thing you expect to see is tennis. You'll see a group of kids on the court playing tennis, playing competitive tennis and just getting after it.""

Chairman of the Board and President of the USTA Jon Vegosen, MaliVai Washington, Billie Jean King, James Blake, First Lady Michelle Obama, Serena Williams and Katrina Adams participate in the Let's Move! tennis clinic during Day Twelve of the 2011 U.S. Open.

'Challenging economic situations'

In an area notorious for drug-related crime and murder, the Foundation quickly blossomed into a comprehensive after-school youth development program providing tennis, homework tutoring and life skills for low-income youth. As a result, graduation rates are high, teenage pregnancies are non-existent and crime rates low among the students who attend the Foundation.

""Oftentimes, kids are coming from very challenging economic situations,"" Washington explains. ""But that can't ever be their excuse for lack of success or lack of education or incarceration, because the Foundation -- that is your advantage.""

The Foundation's focus on tennis and education is something Washington's predecessor, Arthur Ashe, would approve of.

Ashe was not only the first Black man to win a grand slam -- three in total -- but during his career, he became a powerful activist for Black rights, as well as social and political issues.

Washington recalls sitting next to him at West Side Tennis Club at Forest Hills -- the original home of the US Open.

""I remember telling him that I was I was thinking about turning pro after my sophomore year...and this look kind of came on its his face, like 'I don't know whether you should do that.' But I don't think it was necessarily a reflection on me and my tennis, but more reflection about how much he valued education.""

Arthur Ashe won three grand slams.

At that point neither player would know Washington would go on to reach the final of Wimbledon in 96' -- and win the 'Arthur Ashe Humanitarian Award' in 2009 for his work with the Foundation.

""I think what I what I took from Arthur over the years is, as human beings and certainly as athletes who play on an international level, we have a responsibility to do more than just hit a tennis ball.

""And I'm going to paraphrase here in one of his books, he said: 'If I'm just remembered as a tennis player, I failed. I didn't do I didn't do my job.' That one line has always stuck with me and I've tried to in some ways live by that.""",2020-07-09,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/09/tennis/mal-washington-wimbledon-final-cmd-spt-intl/index.html
Matias Grez,Why English football can't afford another 'lost generation' of Black coaches,"(CNN) It's widely accepted that English football lost a generation of influential Black players in the 1980s and 1990s, who might have become managers but never did.

Fast forward to the 21st century and just five of the current 91 (5.5%) managers and head coaches in England's top four divisions are from a Black, Asian or minority ethnic background.

Both the Premier League and the English Football League have backed players and coaches taking a knee in support of the Black Lives Matter movement in recent weeks, but that lowly statistic leaves both organizations looking more exposed.

Gestures are all well and good, but when push comes to shove, when will black coaches be able to showcase their talents from a position of power?

That lack of representation has now prompted the Premier League and EFL to launch a new scheme to help develop Black, Asian and minority ethnic coaches.

The new initiative -- which the Premier League says is ""aimed at increasing the number of Black, Asian and minority ethnic players moving into full-time coaching roles in the professional game"" -- will give six coaches per season a 23-month work placement at EFL clubs.

Darren Moore, manager of Doncaster Rovers, is one just five black coaches in English professional football.

The scheme will be jointly funded by the Premier League and Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) and the first six people will begin their placements at the start of the 2020-21 season.

On the face of it, the initiative seemed like a positive step; a move towards addressing the huge under representation of Black managers and coaches in the top four divisions of English football.

However, Troy Townsend, the Head of Development at anti-racism organization Kick It Out, admits to being ""a little bit underwhelmed"" by the new initiative and fears yet another generation of black players will be overlooked when it comes to getting jobs in management.

Other critics have labeled the new scheme as nothing more than adult work experience.

""We've been in this space before where we've spoken up about the lack of representation in coaching circles, but I'm not sure what this addresses,"" Townsend told CNN Sport.

'Frustration'

According to research carried out by Farenet in 2014, the proportion of Black, Asian and minority ethnic footballers in English professional football -- in first teams, academies and development squads -- since the early 1990s has been an estimated 30%.

The current figure for professional footballers in the UK is around 25%. However, those numbers have never been reflected in senior positions or positions of authority within the sport.

""There seems to be just an entry level for these coaches,"" adds Townsend of the new initiative. ""Six coaches over 23 months, the best part two years; it strikes a chord to me that will only go so far.

""I'm looking and wondering why it's only acceptable to have six coaches and why we cannot progress something that's rolled out right across the leagues and has a little bit more impact as well, so I'm holding fire on on it.

""There will be some coaches that want to go through that process, no doubt, because maybe they're not in the game. But there must be some who are looking at it and thinking: 'I've had the opportunities at this level and I want to try and pit my wits and find out what the highest level is like.'""

Wolverhampton Wanderers boss Nuno Espirito Santo is currently the only black manager in the Premier League.

Townsend, among others, has also questioned why the new initiative is limited to the 71 EFL teams and doesn't include the Premier League.

England's top tier does have its own program -- the Premier League Elite Coach Apprenticeship Scheme (ECAS) which launched in 2015 -- which it says ""complements"" the new EFL initiative.

Former professional footballer Iffy Onuora, who currently works as the equalities coach for the PFA, admits he ""gets the frustration"" of the scheme's critics but says even the best coaches in English football today had to cut their teeth in the lower leagues.

""If you look at even the foreign coaches, the big headline people like [Pep] Guardiola ... certainly [Jurgen] Klopp, who worked at Mainz, they had a grounding lower down in the Bundesliga [and La Liga],"" he tells CNN.

""Certainly that's where they get their first foot hold; you make your mistakes, you build your reputation and you go from there. So, realistically, for us that's the same thing. You go into an EFL club and you try and pick heads through that.""

The problem of under representation isn't only limited to coaching and managerial positions; it's also a problem in senior business and decision-making roles.

Currently, less than 1% of senior roles involved in the running of football clubs are held by an individual of a Black, Asian or minority ethnic background.

Among the few in English football are Les Ferdinand, who holds the position of Director of Football at Queens Park Rangers (one of the clubs the former England international played for), and Burton Albion chairman Ben Robinson, who has overseen the modest club's improbable rise through the football leagues.

While the new scheme perhaps provides a base to build from, Onuora is aware that it's just one part of large variety of issues around race that English football needs to tackle.

""I think this is a part of increasing the pipeline,"" Onuora says. ""It doesn't take away from the other things we need to do. We need to get black faces in the boardrooms, they are the decision makers at clubs. It's not a conversation in isolation, it's got to be a part of a wider picture.

""You gotta have people in the boardroom, you have to encourage the club and the stakeholders to open the doors, [make] transparent decisions. There's the old saying: 'You can't be what you can't see.'

""If the directors and CEO's can't see other directors or CEO's, or other people around them in their network who are people of color as well, then ... we've got very few Ben Robinson's in the boardroom.""

'Ignorance'

One of the five black managers currently in charge of a Football League club is Darren Moore, who has been at third-tier Doncaster Rovers for just under a year.

Moore is a member of the Premier League's Black Participants' Advisory Group -- which was launched last year to ""ensure the views of Black, Asian and minority ethnic players and coaches are heard"" -- and will be offering his support and expertise to the six participants and the clubs involved in the new scheme.

Like Onuora, Moore says he understands the frustrations people have looking in from the outside, but believes even just the announcement of the scheme is already having a positive effect.

Since it was launched, he says his phone and been ringing with coaches wanting to sign up or asking for more information.

""It's a real start and this scheme gets the individuals hands on,"" Moore tells CNN. ""It's a start; six places better off than we were yesterday or the day before. For me, if the group, if the system works ... then I'm sure more EFL coaches will open up to what we are doing.

""It's six places every season. What if we are sitting a year from now and those six places have gone well, that it doubles or it even triples? That means we started from somewhere.

""So, yes, there is going to frustration. Yes, I have illustrated before it's not the be all and end all in terms of fixing the problem, but it is a scheme that has to be looked at as a positive going forward.""

'Rooney Rule'

At the EFL's general meeting last June, it was announced that the 'Rooney Rule' would be officially introduced after an 18-month trial period.

Named after NFL diversity committee chairman Dan Rooney, it requires clubs to interview at least one Black, Asian and minority ethnic candidate for vacant managerial or senior club operation positions.

However, Townsend believes the lack of data available -- the number of black coaches applying, those who reach the interview stage and are turned down and what the process is like for them -- makes the EFL's 'Rooney Rule' difficult to judge.

Townsend says this lack of information leads to one of the biggest frustrations he faces: people asking him if black coaches are even applying for jobs.

""There's a certain amount of ignorance, not only in this game, but in society in general,"" he says. ""When that question gets asked, I chuckle a little bit and I kind of say to myself: 'Well, I cannot continue to keep answering the same questions over and over and over again.'

""I've been privy to a list of all the black coaches that are qualified, that are able, that could go into the industry; not just in the academy environment and not just in the EFL, and I would hope would be able to cut their teeth at a high level. There are many other people that have been privy to that as well.

""So those noises normally come from people who have no appreciation and understanding of the coaching circles and they'll probably continue to exist, but there are a plethora of coaches out there that could be working in the industry and are struggling.

""And maybe we might lose a generation, again, of those good coaches because they just feel that the opportunities are not there for them.""

While Moore accepts the lack of black coaches is unacceptable, he believes the new scheme a first step towards ensuring this same conversation of under representation isn't being had in the future.

""The numbers are alarming, yes they are, let's not go away from the fact that there are currently five that are serving within the game,"" Moore says. ""What I will say to you now is that there are many, many more from the outside serving.

""We are working extremely hard to bring the rest of those people into the game. As I said before, there are many, many talented [coaches] from the Black and Asian community that are outside the game, that need to be inside the game. Not only that, but I individually know that there's a thirst and a hunger for them to serve the game.

""The wonderful thing that we are trying to do now is create platforms where there is more visibility and there's more opportunities inside the professional game. There's more of a movement globally and in the country to see this change.""",2020-07-08,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/08/football/black-asian-and-minority-ethnic-coaching-scheme-english-football-premier-league-spt-intl/index.html
Matt Majendie,'Toto Wolff of Formula E' aims to make sparks fly for Mercedes,"(CNN) His boss might be famed Mercedes F1 chief Toto Wolff, but Ian James is bringing his own ""passionate"" approach as head of the marque's fledgling Formula E team.

The Briton has been tasked with turning Mercedes , the dominant force of Formula 1, into the front-runner in the electric racing series.

Its appearance in Formula E is down in no uncertain terms to a dramatic and very public U-turn by Wolff, who was an early skeptic of the series.

He even said at the team's unveiling he ""didn't believe that Formula E could make it.""

Now, though, Wolff is a fully fledged convert, and he turned to James to lead Mercedes' venture into electric motor sport.

Ian James in Riyadh at the start of the Formula E 2019-20 season.

James shuns comparisons with Wolff, but also aims to copy his boss.

""It's brilliant to work with someone like Toto,"" said James. ""At a race weekend, we speak on multiple occasions. His focus is Formula 1 but he is still very much involved in the Formula E programme.

""What I try to do is the same as Toto, which is holistic. I'm passionate about racing and making sure we're always moving in the right direction. He does that very well.

""He'll leave us to it but he offers great advice when it comes to drivers or analyzing what went wrong at a race and what could have been done better.""

Wolff v Wolff in Formula E

Ian James and Toto Wolff at the Mercedes-Benz EQ Formula E Team launch with the teams' drivers Nyck de Vries and Stoffel Vandoorne.

Despite Wolff's split interest and direction, James is adamant it will have no bearing on Lewis Hamilton or Mercedes' continued ambition to remain No.1 when the F1 season gets under way in Australia next month.

But the Austrian is not the only Wolff James has to deal with. Toto's wife Susie, team principal of the Venturi team , is a partner in using the Mercedes EQ powertrain but also a grid rival.

James laughs at the idea he might be caught in the midst of a Wolff vs. Wolff on-track battle. ""It's certainly a unique position to be in,"" he said. ""But it's great to have Susie on board as she's someone I can have a very open dialogue with.

""We know if we take the right approach and work collaboratively, we can develop both teams faster together. And it would be a dream if all four drivers are fighting for the top spots. Then it gets serious.""

Like Wolff, James' passion for motor sport growing up lay in F1, first getting hooked at the age of five or six.

For him, the standout early moment was spilling onto the circuit at Silverstone when Nigel Mansell won the 1991 British Grand Prix and famously gave rival Ayrton Senna a lift back to the pit lane after he ran out of fuel at the finish.

After studying mechanical engineering at university, James' first job came at McLaren working on the Mercedes Benz SLR McLaren for three and a half years before a switch to Mercedes where he has worked for the last 15 years.

'We're racers'

His roles have been multifarious: part of the team behind the introduction of KERs in 2011 and helping the returning Mercedes to a first victory the following season with Nico Rosberg. But he was also heavily involved in the powertrain development which led to the first world titles in 2014 and the ongoing dominance.

""I'm a jack of all trades, master of none,"" he said. ""I'm an engineer by trade but genuinely a bad one. I've had time in finance and marketing, in program management. It's been a mixed bag.

""And with this, I was lucky -- it was genuinely too good to turn down, not just getting back into motor sport which is a passion of mine but also the opportunity to start up a business.""

And like any motor sport business, the primary goal is winning.

""Internally, there's enough understanding and empathy that expectations are kept in check in our rookie year in a complex series,"" he said. ""But externally we're the team with the three-pointed star, one linked with great success in F1 and DTM before that.

""It takes time, look at F1 for example. But we want to win the competition as we're racers. The mid-term goal is to get into championship contention but we're aware how challenging that will be.

""Of all the things I've done, this will be very hard to top. We're at the start of this journey and making sure we bring the results and build up the business to make sure that it's ready for the future.""",2020-03-11,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/11/motorsport/toto-wolff-of-formula-e-spt-intl/index.html
Emma Reynolds,English rugby union bosses reviewing slave-era song used as chant,"(CNN) England rugby union bosses are reviewing the use of the slave-era song ""Swing Low, Sweet Chariot"" as a chant by fans, saying many may not be aware of its ""historical context.""

The Rugby Football Union (RFU) did not immediately respond to CNN but in a statement released to British media the organization said it was determined to ""accelerate change and grow awareness,"" as the Black Lives Matter movement prompts corporations and institutions to rethink how they operate.

In recent weeks following George Floyd's death , a number of British organizations , such as the Bank of England, and businesses have been reviewing their historical associations with slavery.

""The RFU has stated we need to do more to achieve diversity and we are determined to accelerate change and grow awareness,"" the governing body said in a statement.

""The Swing Low, Sweet Chariot song has long been part of the culture of rugby and is sung by many who have no awareness of its origins or its sensitivities.

""We are reviewing its historical context and our role in educating fans to make informed decisions.""

English rugby union fans at the HSBC London Sevens at Twickenham Stadium on June 2, 2018 in London.

Former England rugby union player Maggie Alphonsi spoke out about why she no longer sings the song, writing on Twitter : ""I will NEVER stop using my voice!!""

Brian Moore, a former English rugby union player and commentator said : ""The world has moved on and, rightly, things that were normal then should not necessarily be normal now ... It should be celebrated in its rightful context.""

But former England cricket captain Michael Vaughan posted a news story about the issues around the song on Instagram with the caption: ""Please tell me if I am wrong ... but this surely can't be right !!??""

Is it right for rugby fans to sing a slave-era song?

The song ""Swing Low, Sweet Chariot"" is one of the most recognized African-American spirituals. Revered, emotive, and rooted in the horrors of US slavery and the oppression of race.

But for the last three decades, the familiar melody has also been the adopted anthem of England's rugby union team, its haunting chorus a common echo in stadiums where the national team plays.

And therein lies the problem.

Cornell Brooks, President of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).

Should lyrics which are about suffering and despair be sung by thousands of England fans who are often middle-class, often White?

""A slap in the face to the history of slavery,"" Cornell William Brooks, then president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), described the use of this spiritual in a sporting arena. Brooks is now Hauser Professor of the Practice of Nonprofit Organizations and Professor of the Practice of Public Leadership and Social Justice at the Harvard Kennedy School.

Lord Herman Ouseley, chairman of anti-racism group Kick it Out in 2017, said singing ""Swing Low, Sweet Chariot"" to cheer a rugby team was a matter of ""ignorance, lack of sensitivity and arrogance,' while American academics have called it cultural appropriation

Three years ago, when asked by CNN whether the RFU would be reviewing the use of ""Swing Low, Sweet Chariot,"" an spokesperson for English rugby's governing body said: ""Swing Low has been associated with rugby and rugby clubs for decades. It is sung by fans to get behind the England rugby team.""",2020-06-19,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/19/sport/swing-low-chant-england-rugby-slavery-gbr-spt-intl/index.html
Ben Morse,Jack Johnson: Black boxer who sparked race riots after world heavyweight win,"(CNN) Global protests sparked by George Floyd's death at the hands of police in Minneapolis are likely never to be forgotten, but less well known are the race riots that flared across the US 110 years ago.

Those riots weren't sparked by police brutality, but by a boxing match.

In 1908, Jack Johnson became the first Black heavyweight boxing champion of the world, fighting at a time when, despite slavery having been abolished 45 years previously, African Americans were still subjected to widespread segregation and racism.

His victory over James J. Jeffries -- in what was billed then as the ""Fight of the Century"" -- on Independence Day in 1910, sent shockwaves through both the Black and White communities across the world

The bout was fought in Reno, Nevada, at the height of the Jim Crow laws era, when racial segregation in the US South was rigorously enforced.

A former undefeated heavyweight champion, Jeffries came out of retirement to ""to make an effort to reclaim the heavyweight championship for the White race."" He added : ""I should step into the ring again and demonstrate that a White man is king of them all.""

Johnson's subsequent victory sparked race riots across the US, pitching a Black community -- jubilant that their champion had won -- against their White counterparts, seething with anger at the outcome of the fight. More than 20 people were killed and hundreds were injured. Most of the victims were Black.

In part due to his refusal to fight Black contenders after beating Jeffries, an extravagant lifestyle and his feud with Joe Louis , Johnson managed to somewhat alienate himself from the Black community and subsequently become something of a forgotten figure.

It wasn't until the rise of Muhammad Ali -- who recognized many similarities between himself and Johnson -- and the arrival of the Black Power era that his career and achievements became more widely appreciated, not just for his sporting prowess but for his trailblazing success in an era when racism was widespread and commonplace.

According to Theresa Runstedtler -- author of 'Jack Johnson, Rebel Sojourner: Boxing in the Shadow of the Global Color Line' -- the boxer's defeat of Jeffries ""ripped the veil off of the niceties that were used to cover up the violence of White supremacy.""

""[Johnson's rise to champion] signified Black possibilities at a moment when all of the regular channels of Black success, whether it be trying to get a quality education or trying to make it in business or even just trying to be involved in politics -- because there was so much widespread disenfranchisement -- this was an example of a success that couldn't be disputed,"" Runstedtler told CNN Sport

""That he had defied social barriers to become the best at something when all of these other barriers were being put up in front of African Americans seeking to improve their social status, symbolically, he was super important.""

Johnson faces Jeffries in the ""Fight of the Century"" in 1910.

Reaching the pinnacle

Perhaps what's even more remarkable about Johnson's success is that he was raised by two former slaves.

""To know that somebody in an era of just the most appalling racism decided as a very young boy that he was going to be something unique and special and then set out to do that is, people talk about the American dream, which is largely a myth, but he embodies it,"" according to Geoffrey C. Ward, author of 'Unforgivable Blackness: The Rise and Fall of Jack Johnson.'

As a Black fighter, he was predominately restricted to facing only Black opponents -- he fought Jeffries' younger brother in 1902 -- competing under the confines of the 'Colored Heavyweight Championship of the World' category which he won in 1903. At the time in some areas of the USA, interracial boxing was banned.

Johnson was the first African American to hold the world heavyweight boxing title when he beat Canadian Tommy Burns in Sydney, Australia.

However, then-current world heavyweight champion Tommy Burns was more open-minded, promising to defend his title against ""all comers, none barred. By this I mean Black, Mexican, Indian or any other nationality without regard to color, size or nativity.""

Burns initially wanted ""to give the White boys a chance"" first -- but Johnson finally got his shot and he took it with both hands.

In 1908, in front of a crowd of 20,000, Johnson was handily beating Burns in Sydney, Australia, before police stopped the fight in the 14th round to prevent Johnson from knocking out his opponent. Nevertheless, Johnson's victory was secure, making him the first-ever Black heavyweight boxing champion.

Given the widespread racial animosity within the American population, largely White media outlets sent out the call for a ""Great White Hope"" to steal the title from Johnson.

After successfully defending his title three times on US soil -- he also drew with Philadelphian Jack O'Brien -- Jeffries, who had since retired to an alfalfa farm, answered the call for a boxer to ""demonstrate the superiority of the White race,"" Ward says.

Jeffries -- who hadn't fought for five years -- said upon accepting the fight: ""I am going into this fight for the sole purpose of proving that a White man is better than a negro.""

James J. Jeffries was once considered one of the greatest heavyweight champions of all time.

'Fight Of The Century'

And so on July 4, 1910, in a bespoke, 22,000 capacity stadium in downtown Reno in front of an entirely White crowd, Jeffries went toe-to-toe with Johnson in what turned out to be as one-sided a heavyweight title clash as you are ever likely to see.

The quicker, more agile Johnson easily evaded Jeffries' lumbering attacks, knocking him down twice. Finally, during the 15th round Jeffries' corner threw in the towel.

""They basically begged [Jeffries] to come out of retirement, pump up his ego and make him think he's gonna win, and he just fails miserably at that,"" Runstedtler said.

Jeffries indicated after the fight his time out of the ring meant he was no longer able to compete with ""The Galveston Giant."" ""I am not a good fighter any longer,"" he said . ""I could not come back. Ask Johnson if he will give me his gloves.""

The result of the fight shocked those in attendance. While Johnson and his team celebrated in the ring, the audience streamed out of the stadium in eerie silence, according to Runstedtler.

Around the US though, the reaction wasn't so muted, with Johnson's victory sparking race riots across many states.

The bout was one of the first fights ever to be filmed, meaning that there was a celluloid record for all to watch. However, just days after the fight, many states and cities banned showings of the Johnson-Jeffries film.

Indeed, two weeks after the fight, former US President Theodore Roosevelt, who himself was a boxing fan, wrote an op-ed in which he supported the banning of moving pictures of boxing matches, hoping that the Johnson-Jeffries bout was ""the last prize fight to take place in the United States.""

From White officials in the US to colonial officials in the British empire , moves were made to prohibit the circulation of the film.

Said Runstedtler, ""[They] were terrified about what this film would do to the delicate balance of power in their spaces where, in particular in the British case, often they were outnumbered by people of African descent.

""There was a huge build-up around it and so it wasn't just the fight itself, and the victory on that day, but the reverberations of it across the rest of the US and the world.""

'A very flamboyant, ostentatious personal presentation'

Outside of the ring, Johnson's lavish lifestyle -- notably his collection of expensive cars -- often alienated him from what people at the time perceived to be a ""respectable"" image of Black leaders of the day, embodied by the term ""Talented Tenth,"" popularized by W.E.B. Du Bois.

""If you've looked at any of the photos of him, he had a very flamboyant, ostentatious personal presentation at a time when African Americans were seen by the rest of society as manual laborers or workers,"" Runstedtler explained.

""He was known to hang out in the vice districts of Chicago and other cities where he traveled and to cavort with the sporting crowd, the gamblers, the pimps, the prostitutes, etc.""

His relationships with Black boxers after he became world heavyweight champion also didn't help. One of his Black challengers at the time, Joe Jeannette said : ""Jack forgot about his old friends after he became champion and drew the color line against his own people.""

Johnson's feud with Joe Louis, world heavyweight champion from 1937 to 1949 and one of the greatest heavyweight boxers of all time, further tarnished his reputation.

Future Black fighters often tried to distance themselves from Johnson as they tried to become ""paragon's of Black middle class respectability,"" according to Runstedtler.

""He bet against [Louis], he hoped Billy Conn would beat him, he hoped Max Schmeling would beat him,"" Ward noted.

""And after the first Schmeling fight in 1936 (which Louis lost), he went down on 120 Fifth Street in Harlem and showed off all the money that he had won betting against Joe Louis and the police had to rescue him from the crowd.""

It wasn't until long after Johnson's death in 1946 that people started to revisit his story and the effect that he had on society, primarily because of the success of Ali and the legendary heavyweight's own interest in Johnson's life.

After going to see ""The Great White Hope"" -- a Broadway show based on Johnson's life, starring James Earl Jones in the lead role -- in 1968, Ali told Jones: ""That's my story. You take out the issue of White women and replace it with the issue of religion. That's my story!""

At that time, Ali's refusal to fight in Vietnam after converting to Islam had resulted in his boxing license being suspended and the government taking hold of his passport. These struggles he faced were the reasons why he saw so many similarities between him and Johnson's plights.

As a result, in subsequent fights, Ali's cornerman, Drew ""Bundini"" Brown, could be heard shouting: ""Ghost in the house! Ghost in the house! Jack Johnson's here! Ghost in the house!"" to encourage Ali.

Johnson (right) faces Jeffries in Reno, Nevada.

""People within the Black community, particularly Black men, revisited his image and said: 'Wow, this guy just did whatever the heck he wanted,'"" Runstedtler said. ""And he embodied the kind of powerful Black masculinity that appealed to people during the Black Power era.""

The Black Power movement began in the 1960's in which activists ""boldly challenged the hatred and violence of an intractable system of racism and oppression,"" the author Joyce Marie Bell wrote

Ali's revisiting of Johnson's story helped catapult the one-time world champion -- who had had his title stripped because of his refusal to be drafted into army service to fight in the Vietnam War -- back into the public's consciousness and also create a lineage of great Black heavyweight boxers.

Even Lennox Lewis -- three-time heavyweight world champion -- said that he would ""never forget that I stand on the shoulders of Jack Johnson.""

""To be honest, I knew more about Muhammad Ali,"" Lewis told the Guardian in 2010. ""He was in our time. But I learned about Jack Johnson. Ali's contribution was profound, but Jack Johnson's was the first. It was quite a story. I am a lover of history and it was good to look again at the sort of attitudes that were about back in those days, to see how far we have come.

""Even though Black people were, in some ways, more accepted in American culture, the promoters' dream became to look for controversy. And Jack Johnson was the first great showman.

""He gave them what they wanted. Look at the time he lived. It was remarkable that he was travelling the world, as a Black man, getting arrested, leaving America, going to Europe. In the end he got old, like we all do, and he got knocked out by Jess Willard.""

Johnson became world heavyweight champion in 1908.

The pardon

In 1913, Johnson was convicted for violating the Mann Act for transporting women across state lines for immoral purposes.

Johnson fled to Europe in 1913 while free on appeal. But after years of fights overseas, including the eventual loss of his title in Havana, Cuba, in 1915, Johnson came home where he eventually turned himself over to U.S. authorities at the Mexican border in 1920 and served 10 months in prison.

While the law had found him guilty of transporting Belle Schreiber across state lines, his Mann Act conviction was clearly ""meant as a lesson to the Black folk, the world around.""

Following a long campaign initiated by documentary maker Ken Burns, and with the support of the late Senator John McCain, Mike Tyson, and Lewis among others, on May 24, 2018, 105 years after being convicted of violating the Mann Act, Johnson was posthumously pardoned by US President Donald Trump.

US President Trump holds a signing Executive Grant of Clemency for Johnson in the Oval Office with Deontay Wilder (second left) and Lennox Lewis (far right) in attendance.

And although Trump's pardoning of Johnson ""brought him back into public view,"" Runstedtler contends Johnson's legacy of rebellion against the status quo wasn't fully acknowledged during the pardon campaign.

""(The White campaigners) don't actually want to embrace a more subversive legacy that he has, which I think is actually the more complicated one and the one that I would hope that he would be remembered for.

""Certainly the campaign to pardon him has brought him back into public view for mainstream White America and potentially folks who are boxing fans in other countries around the world. But there's still a kind of underlying or subversive aspect to his legacy, and I don't think has been fully acknowledged in that pardon campaign.""",2020-07-03,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/03/sport/jack-johnson-fight-of-the-century-110-anniversary-boxing-cmd-spt-intl/index.html
Aimee Lewis,Has the digital age changed football fans?,"(CNN) Sky Ouyang used to avidly follow Real Madrid, keeping up to date with how the La Liga club was doing from his Shanghai home.

A Real shirt from the 2008/09 season -- Cristiano Ronaldo's first campaign as a Real player -- was a prized possession. But then Ronaldo moved to Juventus and Ouyang's loyalties changed.

Focused flicked from Spain to Italy; to the back of the wardrobe went the Real shirt, in came Juventus merchandise, and immediately it was the Italian club the 23-year-old followed on every social media platform.

""I support Ronaldo first and foremost. The team isn't important, it's whoever he plays for,"" the social media executive, who first fell under the Portuguese's spell when Ronaldo was the young buck at Manchester United beguiling with step-overs and swerves, tells CNN Sport.

Ouyang is not alone in switching his allegiances to Juventus following Ronaldo's $117m summer transfer from a club with whom he established himself as one of the greatest to have played the beautiful game.

With 139m Instagram followers, 74m on Twitter and over 122m on Facebook, Ronaldo is the most followed footballer on social media.

Juventus was the fastest growing European club online in China last month, the number of followers ballooning at a rate which has been described as unprecedented.

Perhaps it should be of no surprise that five-time Ballon d'Or winner Ronaldo, a footballer who has only one equal in Lionel Messi for comparable talent and fame, attracts such zealous following in a country where success and celebrity is cherished.

""There hasn't been an incident like this where there's been fans moving from one team to another or deciding to choose and follow a second team. This is probably the largest shift we've ever seen in China,"" says Tom Elsden, senior client manager at Shanghai-based digital marketing and investment company Mailman.

""In the same period, Real Madrid have lost followers so there's been a direct correlation between Juventus growing and Real Madrid losing followers.""

But the tidal wave of followers which came Juventus' way once it signed one of the world's most famous sportsmen was not merely a Chinese phenomenon.

The Bianconeri has gained 3.5m Instagram followers over the last month, while Juventus' engagements, impressions and followers on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have also rocketed.

Does Ronaldo's digital influence, his power to change a fan's allegiance, mean the nature of football fandom has changed?

If Ronaldo, Neymar and Messi all have a bigger social media following than their clubs, is this the era where the sport's biggest names garner more devotion than the teams for whom they play?

Simon Chadwick, professor of sports enterprise at Salford University, says the cult of celebrity has changed the way football fans around the world associate with teams and players.

""There is the emergence of celebrity culture over the last 15 to 20 years in a way that didn't exist in the 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s,"" he tells CNN Sport.

""We're now more interested in celebrities than perhaps we are teams and that's a characteristic of not just football and sport but of life in general.""

George Best is regarded as the first British sportsman to be accorded pop star status.

Star footballers have been hero-worshiped since the beginning of the 20th Century and for decades have attempted to capitalize on their popularity.

At the peak of his footballing powers in the 1960s, former Manchester United winger George Best -- a man once dubbed the fifth Beatle -- famously appeared in an advert in the United Kingdom telling viewers that Cookstown bangers were ""the Best family sausages.""

But much has changed since those black and white days when one of the world's most celebrated players helped increase sales in sausages for a family butcher.

Advertising campaigns are more sophisticated, footballers' brands are carefully cultivated, major clubs and their players are lucrative businesses and, crucially, there is the world wide web.

The internet, said Stephen Hawking, has connected us ""like neurons in a giant brain"" and has allowed players and clubs to communicate directly with fans, while in this globalized world almost everything is accessible, from live streaming a match to buying snazzy boots.

If, as renowned journalist Arthur Hopcraft once wrote, football reflects the kind of community that we are then the sport as it is today, and those who follow it, are a reflection of an interconnected world.

Fans wear Ronaldo and Messi masks during the Russia 2018 World Cup.

""There's something in the way in which the social and digital environment has enabled fans to challenge the existing ways of being a fan and perhaps therefore it's breaking down the barriers to fandom that previously existed,"" says Chadwick.

""The role of social media is shaping people's associations and perceptions.

""For many younger people in particular they have less affiliation with a football team that's embedded in the town where they're from and more association with global icons.

""Those global icons can be Manchester United or Real Madrid, but at the same time those global icons can be Kylian Mbappe, Ronaldo or Paul Pogba.""

Teenager Mbappe's goals and blistering forward play helped France win the World Cup in Russia. The 19-year-old, like so many of Generation Z (those born in the '90s and 2000s), hasn't lived in a world without social media.

France forward Mbappe was named the best young player at Russia 2018.

""We've not heard much about brand France or the marketing potential of the French national team. What we've heard lots about is the commercial potential of brand Mbappe,"" says Chadwick.

""There is a focus on the individual and the marketing of those individuals is consistent with Generation Z and the way Generation Z consumes products and associates with brands.

""I don't think we understand Generation Z as well as we should right now. Do we know that Generation Z is even interested in football? Aren't they more interested in social media and filming each other?

""I would stand by my observation that Generation Z is interested in individuals and their point of engagement is around individuals and you see that through the emergence of vloggers and internet celebrities.""

'Portfolio fandom'

Then there is ""portfolio fandom"" as Chadwick puts it, a reference to fans who will support a number of teams, typically one from each major European league, reflecting ""the fluid and open way many of us lead our lives.""

Portfolio fandom has, to a certain extent, existed for decades. Ardent fans of one particular club will often have a soft spot for a team in a different division.

The nature of fandom has changed, probably for the worst in terms of social media. Michael Calvin

The popularity of the football program ""Football Italia"" which broadcast Serie A matches live on terrestrial TV in the UK in the 1990s helped make following the Italian top flight hipster cool before the word hipster had entered the popular lexicon. That was also, of course, before the English Premier League spread its tentacles across the globe.

Yet even two to three decades ago, the sight of a Barcelona shirt, let alone one with the Catalan club's star player Messi embossed on the back, was rare anywhere outside of the region.

These days seeing children playing in, for example, a Barcelona shirt is common in many neighborhoods around the world. The name on the back of that shirt is also often entirely predictable.

A Cuban boy wears a Barcelona shirt in Havana.

Boys wearing Real Madrid's and Manchester United jerseys sit on a bench in Skopje, Macedonia.

""You hear small anecdotes about kids who might not be Real Madrid fans but they're Cristiano Ronaldo fans,"" says Michael Calvin, an award-winning English sports journalist and author.

""The nature of fandom has changed, probably for the worst in terms of social media.""

Calvin is referring to the rise of Arsenal TV, a channel which has over 820,000 YouTube subscribers and 285,000 Twitter followers, and personifies how the digital age has given fans a platform to voice their opinions, be it for good or bad.

""I don't feel it's very healthy,"" adds Calvin. ""They've got every right to their opinion but it's an uneducated opinion in many cases.

""The whole phenomenon of fan TV where you get people basically expanding on their prejudices and condemning managers out of hand. I don't think that's a very welcome development.""

Millwall fans outside The Den before a Championship match.

In his latest book ""The State of Play,"" Calvin touches on Millwall, a London-based team in the second tier of English football which, like many of its stature, is not internationally supported.

Those who follow the Championship club do so because such devotion has been bequeathed from one generation to the next.

You're born into being a Millwall fan. With the working clubs it's a birthright. Michael Avery

Michael Avery supports the Lions, as did his father, his grandfather, and as do his two children.

""You're born into being a Millwall fan -- you don't think 'I'll start supporting them',"" Avery tells CNN Sport.

""You won't necessarily get someone who's 30 years old who's just got into football supporting Millwall.""

While the club is one promotion away from the riches of the Premier League, Avery says the majority of fans would not want to reach the promised land if it meant sacrificing the club's identity.

""Millwall prides itself on being a working-class club, a family club. It's never been known for big money transfer, or big wages,"" he explains.

""I do feel 95% of the fan base have heritage in the area. With the working clubs it's a birthright. As lovely as it would be to see Millwall make the Premier League, we don't want to sell that identity as a working-class football club just to make it to the top division.""

This week it was revealed that more than half of clubs in the Premier League could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the 2016-17 season because of the league's bumper broadcast deal.

In 2018, Deloitte said the majority of Europe's 20 richest clubs earn no more than a fifth of their income from 'matchday revenues.'

Clubs are increasingly targeting a global audience by signing lucrative commercial deals and so it should be of no surprise that the way those teams are being consumed has changed.

St. Pauli fans hold aloft a flag with the club's recognizable symbol.

Ed Barrett is a Manchester United fan living in Germany. He also follows St. Pauli, a Hamburg-based football club in Germany's second tier which has not won any major titles but whose 29,500-capacity ground is almost always full.

The anti-establishment club has also developed a global following, with its the skull-and-crossbones symbol proving highly marketable.

""FC St Pauli has an image that allows them to exploit a market niche. As such, they went on a sponsor laden tour of the key US market during the summer. If that helps us pay the bills without increasing ticket prices or selling the stadium name, then that really doesn't bother me,"" Barrett tells CNN Sport.

""Likewise, online content or tours by United to gear towards casual fans in the Far East isn't a huge disadvantage to match-going fans. At worst, a minor irritation if you bother following the club on social media where some of the content seems far removed from the essence of the club.""

Fandom has as many layers as a trifle. It is also complex. Fans come in many guises and the extent of their devotion varies. Not that the supporters themselves seem too concerned about these developing intricacies.

""It's a different kind of fan,"" Millwall's Avery says of the disciples of the global icons.

""As much as Ronaldo and Messi are the iconic image, there's obviously an interest in the brand of football. It's just how times have changed.""

It is the clubs themselves, the global players who have chased new supporters, who are having to adapt the most.

""The formation of the Premier League helped to instigate a culture change not just in English football, but in world football more generally,"" says Chadwick.

""The old days, which we can refer to as pre-1992 before the Premier League, were very conventional. They were much simpler and what that therefore did was create not just one generation of fans but multiple generation of fans.

""But post-1992, a new generation of citizens and consumers began to emerge and obviously this is being driven by globalization and digitalization and so the world of football fandom is now much more complex that it was 20, 30, 40 years ago.

""When you begin to factor in Juventus trying to target fans in China through Ronaldo, you're not talking about old Juventus fans and young Juventus fans, but Chinese fans too.

""What football clubs are faced with is having to understand somewhat the Chinese, Europeans, Americans, Millennials, Generation X, Generation X. There are differences between urban and suburban viewers, men and women.

""For football clubs, which are relatively small organizations, understanding this complexity is a huge challenge for them.""",2018-08-17,https://edition.cnn.com/2018/08/17/football/cristiano-ronaldo-juventus-social-media-fans-china-spt-intl/index.html
Motez Bishara,Gay Bowl attracts NFL sponsors and touches lives,"Denver, Colorado (CNN) Magic, it seemed, was possible any time Dorien Bryant touched the ball.

Electric runs like the 98-yard opening kickoff return for a touchdown in front of 108,000 at Penn State, or the 95-yard score at home against Northwestern, or the touchdown catches of 53 and 41 yards against Indiana State peppered his college football career.

Bryant left Purdue University in 2007 as the school's career leader in all-purpose yards, setting multiple Big Ten conference records before signing with the Pittsburgh Steelers.

Yet just a year later, the playmaker was out of football, walking away from an offer from the Tennessee Titans and reportedly ignoring a call from the Dallas Cowboys.

""I came out when I was 24 or 25,"" Bryant tells CNN Sport of his decision to live openly as a gay athlete about a year after ending his NFL pursuit. ""It was more of my choice, I didn't try and push it.""

""I never wanted to be a figurehead for a movement; I don't want to be that guy.""

Dorien Bryant set records in four years at Purdue University, but walked away from an NFL contract to live an openly gay life.

For the first time since childhood, Bryant, who also ran track at Purdue, took a break from sports and focused on himself. Football became an afterthought.

""It was either football or being able to live my life the way I want to live my life, and I'm happier than I ever was,"" he says. ""I love football, but if I can't be me then it's not worth it.""

Now Bryant is back in the sport as his true self, featured as the go-to receiver for the 2017 champion New York Warriors at Gay Bowl, the annual tournament of the National Gay Flag Football League.

Fifty-seven teams from 22 cities battled it out in 100-degree Denver weather last month, in seven-on-seven matches that provided a remarkable level of athleticism for a recreational league.

Bryant is one of at least seven players on the Warriors with college football experience, recruited by teammate Wade Davis, a former Tennessee Titans signee who won an NFL Europe title with the Berlin Thunder.

""The competition has progressively gotten better,"" says Davis, 41, a figurehead in the league who takes the Warriors' quest to repeat as Gay Bowl titleholders seriously. ""The other teams have had to figure out how to get better players and better coaching.""

""I'm happier than I ever was,"" said Byrant (#9). ""I love football, but if I can't be me then it's not worth it.""

Over the past 18 years Gay Bowl has grown from a three-team tournament played in the dirt field of a Hollywood high school to a three-day event held in rotating cities boasting 35 sponsors, including United Airlines, Fidelity Investments, Sheraton Hotels and UPS.

Rosters represent a mix of races, genders and sexual orientations -- and welcome straight players, though their numbers are capped by a quota.

Everything is well organized, from the shuttle buses, to the singing of the Canadian and American anthems, to referees in striped uniforms who sound a lot like their NFL counterparts.

Games are governed by a 57-page rule book , and formed by two 30-minute halves, with tackling replaced by the removal of an opponent's flag belt.

""I never thought in my wildest dreams that it would get this big,"" says co-founder Jim Buzinski, ""but now it's so institutionalized. Cities are bidding for this.""

Honolulu, in fact, recently beat out bids from Austin and Toronto for the 2020 games, while New York will host its second Gay Bowl next year.

The New England Patriots were sponsors of last year's Gay Bowl in Boston, with owner Robert Kraft speaking at the closing ceremony. This year the Denver Broncos made a financial contribution and worked with organizers to boost the tournament's reach.

""This shows that an issue the NFL probably would have avoided at some point in the past, thinking it was controversial, is now so accepted in mainstream that it seemed a no-brainer to be a part of,"" says Buzinski, who also co-founded the news service Outsports. ""It is so routine that no one cares.""

""These are all football players and football fans, which is kind of a good business decision. It shows the progress that has been made.""

For most of the 1,000 or so participants of Gay Bowl, the long weekend represents a reunion of friends and a celebration of football -- the sport they love, which in many ways shaped their lives.

""The majority of my friends in DC are in the league,"" says James Santos of the Washington Generals, a former Air Force enlistee who would go on to win this tournament playing receiver in his fifth Gay Bowl.

""I have friends who met in the league who got married. I've been in weddings, birthday parties, and one funeral. They are like my family outside my immediate family.""

Flag football was also a means for Santos and his sister, who plays in the female league, to come out to their conservative church-going parents from Texas.

""How my parents grew up, it was really frowned upon,"" he says. ""You were just not considered normal, you were considered weak and a sissy.""

""That's just not the case at all, so for them to see that type of contact and passion ... it's just eye opening."" Santos' parents now attend their games often and ""are really into it.""

""These are like everyday people that love sports,"" he says, adding that flag football helped dispel damaging stereotypes sometimes associated with the LGBT community.

What would do wonders for the perception of gay male athletes, Santos says, is to be represented by a prominent pro.

""Like Jackie Robinson for black people, or Billy Jean King for women, we need an equivalent of someone like that to come out -- a stud athlete,"" says Santos, who is black. ""It would be okay. They are not going to lose their jobs.""

Gay Bowl participants take a knee during the singing of the American national anthem on the opening morning of the tournament, September 14, 2018.

Bryant agrees. ""Sheer numbers tell you there are a few LGBT players in the NFL and in the NBA as we speak,"" he says, ""it's just that those guys are afraid.""

The former Purdue standout wonders how things may have turned out if his shot at the NFL happened now instead of a decade ago. He points to Arizona State University signing openly gay high school football player My-King Johnson as a step forward.

""There is more of a conversation like that in professional sports now,"" he says. ""It's slow, but it's progress.""

It appears that football's locker room culture -- which nearly drove former Patriots offensive lineman Ryan O'Callaghan to suicide before coming out -- must evolve for a gay superstar to emerge.

Bryant's Warriors teammate, former San Diego State strong safety Shaun Rogers, says his personal life took a backseat until his athletic scholarship ended.

""Playing football is always like, how is my team going to respond? How is everyone going to respond?"" says the 35-year-old brand innovator with heavily inked arms.

""I don't want nobody to feel uncomfortable about the situation, so I kind of just suppressed it,"" he adds. ""After college, I just became more open with it.

""There was more freedom, I didn't have to worry about my teammates -- even though they were my friends. I just didn't have to be around that culture.""

Gay Bowl XVIII athletes congregated at a welcoming party at a rooftop bar in Denver, Colorado.

Alongside Bryant, Davis and Rogers are Stephan Benjamin, a 6-foot 4-inch, 211-pound former wide receiver at American International College, captain Preston Roberts Jr. from Worcester Polytechnic, and quarterback Chris Allison from Columbia University.

Gelling with the LGBTQ league's ethos of inclusion, Roberts and Allison are two of the Warriors' five allotted straight players, with no more than three allowed on the field at once.

Both prefer to play in New York's gay flag football league, rather than the ragtag games they were a part of in the city. ""I can't think of a straight league that is on this level doing this type of stuff,"" says Roberts.

""This is legit,"" says Allison. ""First off, everyone's got a jersey. Then you've got the tents (shielding resting players from the sun), you've got websites, you've got first aid here. Everyone's got a plan of action.""

""A lot of these leagues we've played in have been ad hoc, you've seen fistfights,"" he adds, noting that in the gay leagues ""people get a little chippy from time to time with competitiveness. But if there is a fight, you're gone. It's not acceptable.""

During his first practice, the quarterback felt ""a different vibe"" straight away. ""Everyone was super friendly with a lot of camaraderie, and so I said 'Why don't we give it a go?'""

Roberts says joining the New York Gay Football League -- which welcomes ""straight allies"" on its website -- was by way of an understanding with Davis.

""He's taught me a lot about this league and about LGBT, so he's only expanded (my mind),"" he says, ""but he wouldn't have invited me to the league if he didn't think that this is something that I could become a part of.""

""If you're a gay participant and you invite a straight player, you probably trust them to be open enough.""

Warriors captain Preston Roberts Jr. (right), who is straight, credited the league for educating him on the LGBT community. ""If you're a gay participant and you invite a straight player, you probably trust them to be open enough,"" he said.

It's the opening morning of Gay Bowl XVIII and players on the vast green field on the outskirts of Denver are slow to get into a rhythm. Maybe a few too many carried on at the welcoming rooftop party the night before.

Bryant, who doubles as a personal trainer for budding college prospects and a bartender in New York, is used to playing on little sleep. ""I get off work on Saturday at like 5 a.m. and we'll practice at like 9 a.m.,"" he says.

Boasting a considerable size advantage, the Warriors dispose of their opponents convincingly.

If anyone on the field is keeping track of which three straight players are playing for each team, it isn't apparent. Enforcement has always been based on an honor system, and by all accounts it works.

""I'm not going to say it's never come up,"" says Roberts of the Warriors' inclusion of high-caliber straight players, ""but relatively speaking, it doesn't. There is a rule for it, but it's not a thing.""

Playing in his fourth Gay Bowl, the former Ivy Leaguer Allison is one of several straight quarterbacks in the league, because -- just like in the NFL -- good flag football quarterbacks are hard to find.

""I'm sure there are a few people who are frustrated about it,"" he says. ""There is definitely a debate there. You have to balance it out and make sure we come to some middle ground where everyone can be happy.""

Buzinski explains why a quota system was implemented after he founded the Los Angeles league. ""We didn't want a situation where a 'gay team' would have 75 percent straight players, and they were the best straight players in high school or college, and they would be ringers.""

""People said, 'Well isn't that discriminatory?' No. You can play flag football in LA or any city in multiple leagues, so they weren't being deprived of an opportunity,"" he notes, adding that he never saw ""a serious violation.""

""People policed themselves."" Besides, ""there was no way we could really test for it,"" he says.

""There were some players that people would swear were straight, and then their boyfriend would show up.""

Joe Cooper of the Denver Summit, who was honored by the league as a Hall of Fame inductee this year, sums up the consensus.

""At the end of the day, you have a lot of gay men who say 'I don't care if he's straight or not, I'm still going to whoop his ass on the football field.'""

Not to be outdone, women have featured prominently at the Gay Bowl since their inclusion seven years ago.

""We're very, very competitive, specifically when it comes to sports,"" says the Denver Mile High Club's Aszur Rollins, who has played on six championship teams. ""We can be a bit brutal with each other.""

New to the city after finishing her tour with the Army, Rollins found flag football ""all encompassing,"" and even met her wife through the league.

""It's really been this amazing experience at an adult time in my life,"" she says. ""I never went to college, so I consider this to be like a college experience for me. I never had this comradery, this sports experience.""

The Denver Mile High Club's Aszur Rollins (right), who won her sixth Gay Bowl, says flag football is ""all-encompassing"" and met her wife through the league.

Before she transitioned to life as a woman, Kaylee Parker played wide receiver at South View High School in North Carolina, battling several top college prospects in the state.

The 38-year-old mechanical engineer moved to Phoenix in 2015 and began living full time as a woman, but missed the competition.

""Originally, I just wanted to play football,"" she says of finding her way onto the Phoenix Fahrenheit, ""and once I started playing, I ended up meeting a lot of cool people, and it's basically like my other family now.""

""It didn't matter to me if it was a straight league or a gay league, but it happened to be what I found.""

Coming from a Phoenix league that is open to all genders, Parker's gender identity has not been an issue. But the Fahrenheit's team captain and quarterback admits she has received some resistance as a trans athlete competing in the women's division of Gay Bowl.

""Everyone has their perspectives,"" she says, adding that flag football is more about finesse, catching skills, quickness and strategy, and less about brute strength. ""So I think that the physicality of it goes out the window.""

(Her sentiment is echoed by Bryant, whose Warriors took fifth place this year. ""It's about who's smart,"" he says. ""You can have the 12 best athletes in this tournament and line up and still lose."")

""I think about it a lot,"" Parker says. ""I wouldn't compete if it was a tackle league.""

The other competitors, she feels, are perfectly capable of facing her across the line of scrimmage. ""I would think that it would discredit a lot of women if I said I wouldn't play.""

Kaylee Parker played high school football in North Carolna before transitioning to life as a woman. The 38-year-old mechanical engineer says her flag football teammates in Phoenix are ""like my other family now.""

Perhaps the game is less physical than tackle football, but it certainly can be rough.

One Warriors player is examined for a possible torn tendon in his knee after the team's very first game, while an LA Express player grumbles to Bryant that he lost a toenail in a collision.

""He acts like I did it on purpose,"" Bryant shrugs to a teammate, after encouraging the player to go to the first aid tent. ""It will grow back.""

Bryant -- who at 33 still sports a six-pack and the unmistakable frame of a pro athlete -- admits he was at first taken aback by the level of play in the league, then checked himself. Was he stereotyping too?

""You know what, you are kind of (surprised) at first,"" he says. ""But then when you step back and think about it, why? Why are we surprised?

""Because they are gay men? Like, we can play,"" he says, eyebrows raised, head nodding. ""It is a recreational league, but we can play.""",2018-10-17,https://edition.cnn.com/2018/10/17/sport/gay-bowl-xviii-nfl-denver-broncos-intl-spt/index.html
Sarah El Sirgany,Coronavirus death rates in Yemen's Aden could exceed its wartime fatalities,"(CNN) Ghasan Saleh starts digging graves at the break of dawn to prepare for the dead bodies that will come in droves. Two men in white hazmat suits appear atop an approaching pickup truck. They hastily drop a corpse into a hole and cover it with dirt.

The health workers come and go in near-silence. Fear of infection means there are no mourners for those suspected to have died from Covid-19.

The cycle of digging and abrupt funerals continues under the blistering sun and suffocating humidity of Aden , the seat of power of the UN-recognized government in war-torn Yemen.

The Al Radwan cemetery has quickly expanded over the past few months, with new graves creeping closer to the residential buildings that border it. ""You can see my digging machine,"" says Saleh. ""Just now I dug 20 graves.""

Local medical authorities say that death rates in Aden are soaring this year, despite a relative lull in a war that ravaged the place in previous years.

The Al Radwan cemetery in Aden has rapidly expanded after a surge in Covid-related deaths.

In the first half of May, the city recorded 950 deaths -- nearly four times as many as the 251 deaths in the whole month of March, according to a Ministry of Health report.

Those 950 deaths in two weeks in May represent nearly half the number of casualties the city suffered in all of 2015, when the country's civil war was raging.

Back then Aden was devastated by heavy fighting, its streets blasted by rockets and its houses peppered with bullets. Now the city's biggest killers are silent.

On top of Covid-19, there's also a mosquito-transmitted virus outbreak, known as Chikungunya virus , and more than 100,000 known cholera cases across the nation. Many malnutrition centers and hospitals have closed due to funding shortfalls and doctors' concerns about their personal safety from coronavirus. Flash floods this spring destroyed the city's power grid.

""Yemen has faced wars and cannot handle three pandemics, economic collapse and a war and the coronavirus,"" Dr. Ishraq Al-Subei, the health official responsible for the response to the disease told CNN.

The official Covid-19 death toll in southern Yemen stands at only 127. Health workers say they don't know what the actual number is, because of low testing capacity. But the huge surge in deaths in Aden is being seen as a warning of worse to come, as the health sector becomes overwhelmed and more people die of treatable diseases.

In pursuit of a hospital bed

Hmeid Mohammed, 38, had an agonizing journey that started with a mild fever at home.

His family couldn't find a hospital to take him to when his fever started to rise rapidly in early May. He was in a coma when he was admitted by the only hospital in Aden designated to treat Covid-19 at the time.

""They brought him back to life,"" his brother-in-law Anwar Motref recalled.

He was diagnosed with meningitis, another disease common in Yemen. As soon as he showed signs of improvement, doctors advised him to leave the hospital to avoid becoming infected with Covid-19.

About a week later, his health deteriorated. Again, the family went to different hospitals in an effort to have him admitted, but with little success. Eventually they found him a bed in an emergency ward that he shared with six other people. Fluid filled his lungs and his kidneys were failing.

The family had the funds for medical treatment, but Aden's hospitals were either closed or full. A hunt for admission to a hospital that could perform surgery and dialysis in time to save him failed.

Mohammed died in late May, robbing his three children and widow of the family's only bread-winner.

""Who is to blame for all of this? We do not have a government or a state or anyone to help us in this country,"" Motref said at the family home in the rocky hills around Aden.

""Who should we complain to? We are tired of this life. Every morning we wake up to hear of 10-15 people who died,"" he added.

Local health officials say Aden recorded an average of 55 daily deaths in May, a significant surge from previous months.

Disappearing aid and a collapsing health sector

The guns in Aden have become quieter in recent months but Yemen's war has not gone away.

Five years of conflict has beggared the nation. Today more than half its population relies on aid to survive.

But the United Nations is now facing a potentially catastrophic shortfall in funds -- around $1 billion -- for this year. It is warning of a collapsing heath sector and the possibility that Yemen's death toll may continue to rise dramatically -- possibly exceeding the total number of dead during five years of war, when the country endured what was considered the world's ""worst humanitarian crisis.""

Fatalities in Aden, the seat of power of Yemen's internationally-recognized government, are poised to exceed its wartime fatalities.

""We are a billion short of our minimum target,"" Lise Grande, the head of the UN's humanitarian operations in Yemen, told CNN. ""So In the time of Covid what this means is that we're going to see approximately half of the hospitals which we are currently supporting in the country closed down -- and that's going to be happening in just the next few weeks.

""A week before the first Covid-19 case was confirmed in Yemen we ran out of money and had to stop allowances for 10,000 frontline health workers across the country. In the middle of Covid, it's devastating,"" she added.

There are just 60 hospital beds dedicated to Covid-19 in Aden, which has a population of roughly 800,000. These are in two hospitals operated by Doctors Without Borders (MSF). The city has 18 ventilators, all constantly in use, according to MSF.

Doctors and aid workers say patients mostly seek hospital treatment in late stages of the disease, when it is likely too late to save them. And in most cases, there is no capacity to treat them.

""Most cases are rejected because there are no available ventilators,"" Dr. Farouk Abduallah Nagy, head of the isolation department at the Gomhuria Hospital, told CNN.

Anwar Motref helped his brother-in-law Hmeid Mohammed find a hospital bed in his last days. Now, Mohammed's children are in his care.

""The health sector was already weak before the outbreak. And it is getting worse and worse. The health sector is collapsing,"" said Caroline Seguin, MSF communications officer in Aden.

Outside the city, the fighting between southern separatists and the government rages on , compounding the effects of the ongoing five-year war between Houthi rebels in the north and the fractious coalition backed by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in the south.

More than 112,000 people have been killed in airstrikes, shelling and bombing, according to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED).

Hundreds of thousands of people have been driven into camps as refugees from the war. There they face the risks of endemic disease, malnutrition, and overcrowding -- all ideal conditions for the spread of a disease like Covid-19.

Mokhtar Ahmed, originally from the port city of Hodeidah in the north, came to a camp on the outskirts of Aden three years ago.

""Cholera and the wars are one thing and corona is something else,"" he told CNN, flanked by his two children.

""With war, we moved from one place to another and we settled down... But with corona, no matter where you go, it will find you.""",2020-06-12,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/12/middleeast/yemen-coronavirus-deaths-intl/index.html
Tamara Qiblawi,"Dumpster diving, blackouts and suicides. Lebanon's woes laid bare as crisis deepens","Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) A young man with a swagger approaches a dumpster. An employee from a nearby restaurant has just dumped a trash bag inside. He scoops the bag up, rummaging through it to look for leftover hummus and beans. Finding a half-smoked cigarette, he lights it, and puts it to his lips. Then, wiping his hands on his black shirt, he pokes his head into the container one last time, to check there's nothing else he can use, before walking away.

Two blocks away, on Beirut's bustling Hamra Street, a baby stroller lies atop a pile of garbage bags. ""What do you think? Could we use this?"" A veiled, middle-aged woman asks her young daughter. The woman holds up the contraption, examining its contorted pink rods.

Across the country, elderly couples sift through refuse together, and young men scrounge for clothes and shoes to bring back to their families.

Many of them cower when approached by cameras and journalists. ""Please, just go to the other side of the street. Go far away,"" one man, searching through a Beirut dumpster, told a CNN crew.

For many of those scavenging for goods in Lebanon , poverty is a new, and bitter, experience.

A man dismantles and sorts through discarded electric devices at a scrap workshop in the Bab al-Tabbaneh neighborhood of Lebanon's northern city of Tripoli on June 3, 2020.

As Lebanon entered a Covid-induced lockdown earlier this year, the destruction of the middle class remained largely out of sight, but now, as it reopens, there's no escaping the dystopian scenes of desperation repeated across the country.

Nearly every day, the snowball effect of Lebanon's economic meltdown brings new developments. For weeks, the country's currency has been in free-fall, losing 60% of its value in the last month alone.

People's life savings, locked up by the banks' discretionary capital controls, imposed since November, are largely believed to have gone up in smoke.

Doctors and university professors who, just a few months ago, were considered upper-middle class are now making the equivalent of a few hundred dollars a month.

Meanwhile, prices have surged -- the situation is verging on hyper-inflation -- and fuel shortages have plunged the country into darkness, with power outages lasting almost 24 hours.

The capital city of Beirut remains in darkness during a power outage on Monday, July 6, 2020.

""It feels very hopeless,"" said Carmen Geha, an activist and associate professor of public administration at the American University of Beirut. ""You're sitting and waiting and every day it gets worse, and the people around you get worse.

""It feels like you're waiting for the end of the world, with people eating out of garbage cans and people stealing from pharmacies,"" she added, recalling one recent armed robbery of diapers at a pharmacy. Diapers are prohibitively expensive for many in Lebanon.

""I didn't think it was going to be this bad,"" she said. ""I didn't think we would be living in a jungle.""

Less than nine months ago, the country swelled with acts of indignation against a political elite widely accused of corruption. Protesters demanding the downfall of Lebanon's sectarian leadership forced nationwide road closures, and patriotic anthems blasted from speakers set up at makeshift protest sites likened to social utopias.

Fast forward to today, and the contrast is stark.

The flurry of small demonstrations that continue to crop up around the country receives scant media attention. Instead, a string of recent suicides dominates conversations, and the atmosphere is solemn.

Half-empty cafes and restaurants play music at low volume, and social media pages that would normally be advertising summer parties and carnivals now issue a rapid succession of calls for solidarity and humanitarian relief.

Last Friday, a man shot and killed himself near a Dunkin Donuts branch in the middle of a busy street. He had prepared a sign, reading: ""I am not a heretic,"" in reference to a well-known Lebanese leftist song, and an apparent reference to religious taboos around suicide. The verse continues: ""But hunger is heresy.""

Even attempts to lighten the mood appear only to have succeeded in deepening people's sorrow.

On Sunday, an orchestra inside the ancient city of Baalbeck's Temple of Jupiter -- a venue that once hosted concerts by the likes of Nina Simone and the Egyptian diva Um Kulthoum -- played to an empty hall. The concert, entitled ""The Sound of Resilience,"" was broadcast across the country.

But as a light show beamed out from the concert hall to the soaring notes of Carmina Burana, a drone camera rose above the majestic temple, showing the vibrant colors glowing amid the pitch-black darkness of yet another power outage. Many saw this as funeral dirge for a bygone era.

But activists insist that there will be an end to this bleak picture.

Around the country, there is growing anger at a ruling elite that has done little to stymie the country's economic meltdown.

Leading figures in the political class point fingers at each other, jockeying for power. Reforms promised by the government of Prime Minister Hassan Diab, a self-style technocrat, have largely fallen by the wayside.

Negotiations with the International Monetary Fund have stalled after politicians aligned with the country's banking elite torpedoed the government's IMF-endorsed economic program, which had been expected to dig into bank profits.

Lebanese Prime Minister Hassan Diab and Iraq's Oil Minister Ihsan Abdel-Jabbara hold a meeting in Beirut on July 3, 2020.

The international community -- once an active player in Lebanese domestic politics -- has also been largely idle.

US officials have repeatedly signaled that aid would be conditional on Iran-backed Hezbollah's exit from government, where they have had seats since 2005.

International transfers have slowed because more foreign banks are shying away from a Lebanese banking sector riddled with accusations of mismanagement.

Many also suspect that Lebanese banks could be affected by the newly imposed Caesar Act, which sanctions assets from neighboring Syria.

Amine Issa, political coordinator for non-sectarian party The National Bloc, argues that the solution lies in nothing short of political transformation.

He calls the economic meltdown a ""panic-driven collapse,"" prompted by tumbling trust in the political leadership. ""The whole issue is one of trust ... not of supply and demand,"" said Issa.

He believes a boost in political confidence could lead to an economic turnaround: ""If (the leadership) stays then the country goes towards destruction,"" he said, calling up images of an educated middle class preparing to abandon the country, in favor of more promising shores.

""What happened on October 17 was a huge step,"" he said, referring to the popular uprising that began last year. ""There is a new breath, a new conviction, a new awareness that we want to build on.""

Some argue that the relative silence of the protest movement is because activists are busy organizing, coalescing into a political alternative to the current sectarian leadership.

The solutions, activists say, aren't something from a political utopia but lie within the existing legal system, which favors a non-sectarian state.

""We are very different from other Arab regimes because the solution is in our constitution,"" said AUB's Geha. ""We need to activate this system, that's all. It says that there should be a transition into a non-sectarian state.

""This is not like saying we want to bring a regime down because we want freedom. Actually, we're hostages of not having a system,"" she said. ""It is the pursuit of the rule of law.""

Meanwhile, acts of social solidarity are as commonplace as signs of despair.

Analysis Jomana Karadsheh,Why West Bank annexation poses an existential threat to Jordan,"(CNN) On what was once a desert minefield separating Jordan from Israel , King Hussein and Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin made history. It was October 1994 and the Jordanian and Israeli leaders were signing a peace deal, turning the page on decades of war and hostility.

The iconic moment was in no small part the result of a shared vision for peace by two men who were said to have a personal chemistry between them. It was a day ""like no other,"" an emotional King Hussein announced. It was ""the dawning of the new era of peace... As we come together to ensure, God willing, that there will be no more death, no more misery, no more suspicion, no more fear, no more uncertainty.""

But 26 years on, that vision looks like an illusion. The survival of the peace treaty -- one of two Israel has with the Arab world -- is now in question.

""We are at ... the lowest level in the relationship ... since the signing of the peace treaty"" Jordan's Prime Minister Omar Razzaz told CNN in March. At the time, it seemed as though the relationship could be salvaged, that Israel and the Trump administration could be dissuaded from making good on promises to annex parts of the West Bank.

Now, while the immediate timetable for annexation might be slipping a bit, Israel still appears to be on the verge of unilaterally proclaiming sovereignty on a patch of land that is a critical part of Jordan's foreign and domestic policy. This has driven the Jordanian sovereign, King Abdullah, into a corner.

The Jordanians share the view of much of the international community when it comes to this issue: annexation of the West Bank, they say, would kill the long-touted two state solution. It would undermine a 2002 Arab peace initiative that outlines a future Palestinian state based on Israel's pre-1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital. The Jordanian monarch has also long believed that there will be no end to the region's turmoil without a resolution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, something that appears to be an ever-dimmer prospect after US President Donald Trump's peace plan failed to bring the Palestinians back to the negotiating table.

But for Jordan, this is not just about peace in the region. The end of the two-state solution would present an existential threat to the Kingdom, rattling its identity and future.

US President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump welcome Jordan's Queen Rania and King Abdullah II outside the West Wing of the White House in April 2017.

A deteriorating relationship with Netanyahu

The relationship between Israel and Jordan has grown more strained with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the helm. Jordanian officials have always been wary of him and his right-wing politics. But a Netanyahu emboldened by Trump's backing has become nearly impossible for Jordanian officials to work with.

According to a Palestinian media report citing a Jordanian official in June, the King didn't take a call from the Israeli PM. Jordanian officials would not confirm or deny the report that was widely circulated in Israeli media.

The Israeli Prime Minister's office said the report is not true.

""The message should be clear: annexation will not go unanswered. For if it does, there will only be a fiercer conflict. Annexation will make the two-state solution an impossibility,"" Jordan's Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi warned at a committee meeting in early June.

The two countries still maintain close ties when it comes to security and intelligence sharing. Historically, Jordan -- while small and resource-poor -- has always been important for Israel. In a hostile neighborhood, Jordan provided Israel with a buffer on its eastern frontier and served as a mediator when Israel needed one.

But now Jordan has its own interests at stake. More than half of Jordan's population of 10 million is of Palestinian descent, and the country is home to more than 2 million registered Palestinian refugees. From a Jordanian perspective, a future Palestinian state would ensure that these refugees would have a right of return and prevents any possibility of a further influx of people. Without that state, Jordan could turn into a de facto state for the Palestinians -- something Jordanians fear is in fact the ultimate aim of right-wing Israelis.

If Netanyahu goes ahead with the plan on or after July 1, the immediate concern for the Jordanians will be quelling anger on their streets, potentially putting King Abdullah in one of the toughest positions of his two-decade rule.

The peace treaty between the two countries never got popular support. Calls have been growing among lawmakers and the public for the Kingdom to abolish the peace treaty and sever ties with Israel.

In May, the monarch told the German publication Der Spiegel that if annexation went ahead it would lead to ""a massive conflict with ... Jordan."" While not going as far as threatening to abrogate the peace treaty, he said all options were being considered. It was his most stark warning to the Israelis yet.

It is not clear what that ""conflict"" would entail but unrest in the Middle East is always an opportunity for extremism to flourish. Additionally, an annexation -- whether partial or total -- vindicates anyone in Jordan who opposed peace with Israel, and gives those who advocated against trusting Israel an opportunity to turn around and say. ""I told you so.""

Trump and Netanyahu take part in an announcement of Trump's Middle East peace plan in the White House on January 28, 2020.

The king's options are limited. His country is heavily reliant on US aid and with a US president who has frequently used aid as leverage and threatened to withhold it from allies, Abdullah would have to tread carefully. Risking US aid would be dangerous for the country, especially with growing public discontent over the state of the economy.

Standing alongside King Abdullah in the White House's Rose Garden in 2017, President Trump showered his key ally with praise and promised to consult with the monarch on an Israeli-Palestinian peace plan. But in the months and years that followed, Abdullah was sidelined and his advice was ignored. Jordanian officials say they only saw the peace plan when it was unveiled in January.

These shifting relationships appear to have prompted the Jordanian monarchy to circumvent the White House in their bid to prevent annexation and appeal directly to Republican and Democratic US lawmakers. The king held several video calls with congressional leaders, including Nancy Pelosi and Mitch McConnell in mid-June.

Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi has been engaged in a diplomacy marathon, trying to garner international backing for Jordan's campaign to stop the annexation. In mid-June, he paid a rare visit to Ramallah, the seat of the Palestinian Authority's power, in a show of support to Palestinians. He also held a series of calls with his Arab and Western counterparts, including the German, Austrian, Egyptian, Irish and Finnish foreign ministers, asking them to work to stop the annexation.

Jordan's efforts may do little to stave off the Israeli plan, but pressure from another influential Arab state may be having more of an impact on Israeli decision making.

In an unusual move, the United Arab Emirates Ambassador to the US, Yousef Al Otaiba in a Hebrew-language article published in an Israeli daily, called the annexation move ""an illegal seizure."" He gave Israelis an ultimatum: it is either annexation or normalization.

The UAE and other Arab Gulf states have been moving closer towards normalizing ties with Israel. A strategic relationship Israel has been pursuing for years.

""Annexation will certainly and immediately upend Israeli aspirations for improved security, economic and cultural ties with the Arab world and with UAE. With the region's two most capable militaries, common concerns about terrorism and aggression, and a deep and long relationship with the United States, the UAE and Israel could form closer and more effective security cooperation"" Al Otaiba wrote.

The influential diplomat also singled out Jordan and his country's concerns about the impact annexation will have on the Kingdom. Abu Dhabi's Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Zayed reiterated his country's support for Jordan's bid in a tweet last week.

""(The annexation) will send shock waves around the region, especially in Jordan whose stability -- often taken for granted -- benefits the entire region, particularly Israel,"" Al Otaiba warned.",2020-07-01,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/01/middleeast/jordan-west-bank-annexation-israel-intl/index.html
Tamara Qiblawi,"As the US rolls out new sanctions on Assad, Syria braces for economic devastation","Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) The United States has rolled out fresh sanctions that aim to drive Syrian President Bashar al-Assad back to a UN-led negotiating table and threaten to devastate Syria's already floundering economy.

On Wednesday the US State Department and Treasury Department released 39 targets for sanctions, including Assad and his wife Asma al-Assad, marking ""the beginning of what will be a sustained campaign of economic and political pressure to deny the Assad regime revenue and support it uses to wage war and commit mass atrocities against the Syrian people,"" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement.

""We anticipate many more sanctions and we will not stop until Assad and his regime stop their needless, brutal war against the Syrian people and the Syrian government agrees to a political solution to the conflict as called for by UNSCR 2254,"" he said, referring to a UN Security Council Resolution calling for a ceasefire and political settlement in Syria.

The first tranche of economic penalties come as part of the newly enforced Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act, which is expected to trigger the most wide-reaching and aggressive economic penalties ever imposed on Syria, potentially targeting its energy, construction and banking sector.

The bill was named after a former photographer for the Syrian military, codenamed Caesar, who leaked a trove of photographs showing dead and mutilated prisoners in Assad's jails.

""Caesar,"" the man credited with smuggling out 50,000 photos said to document Syrian government atrocities, listens to his interpreter as he prepares to speak at a US Congressional briefing in July 2014.

US Ambassador to the United Nations Kelly Craft told the Security Council on Tuesday the move was a bid to ""prevent the Assad regime from securing a military victory, and to steer the regime and its allies back toward Special Envoy (Geir) Pedersen and the UN-led political process.""

Syria angrily hit back at the sanctions on Wednesday, saying the US move ""exceeds the ugliest forms of lies and hypocrisy.""

In a statement to state-run news agency SANA, Syria's Foreign and Expatriates Ministry also questioned US moral authority, in the light of recent widespread protests over the deaths of several black Americans in police custody. The US, it said, ""is the last one who has the right to talk about the human rights, because the US administrations have established their state upon the culture of killing, disregarding any value of laws or conventions,"" it said.

China and Russia also criticized the plan on Tuesday. China's UN Ambassador Zhang Jun called the sanctions ""inhumane."" Russia's UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia accused Washington of attempting to ""overthrow the legitimate authorities of Syria,"" according to Reuters

The Caesar Act, a bipartisan Congress bill, has received broad support from Syria's diaspora community, many of whom were driven into exile by Assad's brutal oppression of largely peaceful protests that began in 2011. Assad has been repeatedly accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity in his military campaign to quash Syria's armed opposition. He is also widely believed to have been behind multiple chemical attacks in rebel-held areas. Assad's government has repeatedly denied the charges.

But even among Syria's opposition, many expect that the US sanctions will also deal a crushing blow to Syria's civilian population. The poverty rate stands at over 80%, according to the UN . Syria's currency collapsed rapidly in recent months on the heels of an economic crisis in neighboring Lebanon, where many Syrian businessmen circumvented international sanctions during the war. Much of Syria lies in ruin.

""(Syria's) economy has become something similar to the economy of the West Bank, an economy reliant on aid,"" Syria analyst and nonresident scholar at the DC-based Middle East Institute Karam Shaar told CNN. ""It's not really a functional economy. It's basically something that survives only because the West keeps injecting money into it.""

US sanctions threaten to cut off injections of cash from donations and remittances that keep the country afloat. Because the Caesar Act includes secondary sanctions -- punishing non-US people and entities for transactions with regime-held Syria -- they will likely create ""phobia"" and ""panic from banks"" around dealing with Syria, said Shaar, choking off financial transactions to the country.

He also warned that humanitarian exemptions for food and medicines included in the Caesar Act may have no effect, a situation that would be similar to Iran, which has also struggled to obtain medicinal supplies despite US waivers.

""When you have an act that destroys the exchange rate of a country -- and you know that 60% of the inputs for the pharmaceutical industry are actually imported -- you are affecting medicines,"" said Shaar. ""The Caesar Act will affect everything.""

""Unless the Syrian regime accepts to negotiate, I project a famine and it's going to be terrible.""

The sanctions' knock-on effects in neighboring Lebanon are also expected to further cripple its collapsing economy. Lebanon's banking sector, which is buckling under a severe liquidity crisis, is believed to possess billions of dollars of Syrian assets. Because of this, the international financial system may soon deem Lebanon's banks untouchable, said Shaar.

Tensions in Lebanon have reached fever pitch in recent weeks, as its currency continued to tank, stoking riots across the country. On Tuesday night, the leader of the Iran-backed militant and political group Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, delivered a fiery televized address vowing to prop up Syria economically and calling on Lebanon to spurn US pressure to abide by the Caesar Act.

Nasrallah also accused the Trump administration of ""laying siege"" to Lebanon's economy in an effort to pressure Hezbollah, and suggested that the country could move deeper into the economic orbit of Iran, Syria and China, doing away with US influence.

Lebanon's political establishment is composed of a hodge-podge of pro-US and pro-Iran politicians. Hezbollah, which intervened in the Syrian war on Assad's behalf, is the most powerful political force in Lebanon.

The US has repeatedly said that it supports reforming Lebanon's deeply sectarian political leadership and combating corruption, and has not yet publicly pre-conditioned economic support for Lebanon on Hezbollah's disarmament. But local media and politicians have speculated that the international community has shunned the country as part of a ramped up international effort to dislodge the armed group.

""(Lebanon's government must) demonstrate that they're willing to take tough decisions to reform,"" said Assistant Secretary for Near Eastern Affairs David Schenker at a talk at the Middle East Institute earlier this month. ""It's hard to see how (Hezbollah) are going to get behind this reform.""

As Assad and his allies double down on anti-US stances, there are few signs the Syrian government intends to return to the negotiating table, and analysts warn that the Caesar Act will do little to hold Assad accountable for his crimes.

""Caesar's proponents hope that the law will prove a step towards accountability for the regime's terrible crimes,"" Syria Program Director at Synaps Group Alex Simon told CNN. ""While that goal is unassailable, there's no evidence to suggest that Caesar would achieve this.""

Simon describes the sanctions as a ""policy of piecemeal, reflexive escalation, for which ordinary Syrians pay the price.""

""People today are selling off what few assets they still have in order to feed their families. Some are selling kidneys,"" said Simon. ""Pharmaceutical shortages are so bad that people have taken to Facebook to pool information on who has spare medicine that may help save lives.""",2020-06-17,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/17/middleeast/syria-caesar-act-us-sanctions-economy-intl/index.html
Tamara Qiblawi,Nationwide protests grip Lebanon as currency tanks,"Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) Anti-government protesters took to the streets in multiple Lebanese urban centers on Thursday, setting up burning barricades and forcing road closures as the country's currency fell rapidly.

Demonstrators hurled stones at military forces and some protesters attempted to scale a security fence outside the prime minister's office in the capital city Beirut. Protesters chanted against the country's political elite, which many hold responsible for the country's economic woes

Lebanon's main coastal highway was closed by burning tires in the north and south of the capital, as protests were staged in areas that rarely see demonstrations, such as Hezbollah strongholds in the capital's southern suburbs.

Protesters chant slogans in the Lebanese capital Beirut's southern suburb late on June 11, 2020.

In the northern city of Tripoli, protesters pelted the army with rocks and threw Molotov cocktails at the city's Central Bank office. Protests also erupted in the southern cities of Saida and Nabatieh.

In recent days, Lebanon's currency has taken a nosedive, losing around 70% of its value since October. The currency's collapse has stirred panic in a country that relies heavily on imports for its basic needs.

Tamara Hardingham-Gill,Boom supersonic jet set for 2021 take off,"(CNN) — Over 50 years after Concorde first took to the skies, a brand new supersonic jet is preparing for lift off.

Denver based start-up Boom Supersonic has announced it will roll out XB-1, a 1:3 scale prototype of its upcoming supersonic commercial jet Overture, on October 7, with test flights beginning in 2021.

The move will help to pave the way for the first commercial supersonic flights since the legendary delta-wing passenger airliner made its last flight in 2003

""XB-1 is the first step in bringing supersonic travel back to the world,"" Blake Scholl, founder and CEO of Boom Supersonic, said in a statement on the company's website.

Supersonic flight revival

""Flights at twice the speed mean we can travel twice as far -- bringing more people, places, and cultures into our lives.""

According to Boom, the purpose of XB-1 is to demonstrate and prove the ""key technologies"" for Overture, such as advanced carbon fiber composite construction and computer-optimized high-efficiency aerodynamics.

The company has also released images of the experimental aircraft, described as ""history's fastest privately developed aircraft,"" in the hangar, including the completion of its wing installation.

""Our experiences in the Covid-19 pandemic underscore for all of us the fundamental human need for personal connection,"" says Scholl.

""Faster travel enables us to experience the world's people, cultures, and places. With XB-1, we're demonstrating that we are prepared to bring back supersonic.""

The results of the XB-1 test program, which claims to be 100% carbon neutral, will allow the company to fine tune the design for supersonic airliner Overture.

""We're ensuring that the supersonic future is safe and environmentally and economically sustainable,"" he added.

""We've learned that the demand for supersonic has grown even faster than we anticipated.""

Before the pandemic, Boom had garnered at least $6 billion worth of pre-orders for the aircraft, which has a price tag of $200 million, with buyers included Virgin Group and Japan Airlines, which invested $10 million in the company in 2017.

If all goes to plan, Overture, which is designed to seat between 55 to 75 people, will begin passenger flights in 2030. It will focus on over 500 primarily transoceanic routes that will benefit from the aircraft's Mach-2.2 speeds -- such as New York to London, a journey that would take just three hours and 15 minutes.

The aircraft has been designed with the latest noise-reducing technologies and will only fly at supersonic speeds while over oceans to ensure that populated areas are not affected by sonic booms.

Natasha Bazika,Black owner of French-style rosé label is on a mission to change the pink drink's perception,"(CNN) — Rosé, the pale pink adult beverage that gets its hue from the skins of red wine grapes, symbolizes summer for many.

Often, it's the drink linked to sun-kissed women sporting crisp, white flowy dresses and to female-only happy hours.

In spite of its richness — notes of cherry, grapefruit, strawberry and melon to name a just a few — and a color palette that ranges from muted blush to bold fuchsia, it rarely gets the respect it deserves.

But winemakers such as Donae Burston, founder of La Fete du Rosé , are pushing back against tired rosé stereotypes and attempting to make the beverage broadly appealing.

Burston, who's responsible for bringing the first Black-owned rosé label from France's Saint-Tropez to the United States, is up for the challenge.

#Roséallday

According to Amy Racine, beverage director of JF Restaurants, most mass-produced rosé is owned by larger companies who possess major Champagne and tequila labels, which tend to be marketed to a young, sometimes wealthy beach-town crowd.

In recent years, marketing efforts of certain rosé brands can also be attributed to the oversaturation of rosé on social media.

""The #roséallday has been used a lot and it can be a turnoff to a lot of people,"" said Racine. ""It's gained a reputation to be a party drink or just an afternoon sipper rather than a serious style.""

Enter La Fete du Rosé. Baltimore-native Burston, passionate about French rosé and his product in particular, is on a mission to disrupt the way many of us have come to think about rosé.

Owner and founder of La Fete du Rosé, Burston is an African-American pink wine-loving entrepreneur. The name of his brand translates to rosé party, so it's not that Burston has a problem with the drink's party-happy reputation. It's just that he wants to expand the party's reach.

Love at first sip

After working in the beverage industry for the likes of Dom Perignon, Veuve Clicquot, Ruinart and Moët & Chandon, Burston recognized some wines seemed marketed to specific demographics.

""I worked on Veuve Clicquot in 2009 and the consumer target was clear — a female who makes a certain income a year,"" says Burston. ""However, my friends who are Black, Asian and Hispanic liked to drink Clicquot, yet the popular brand segmented who they were for.""

Burston wasn't satisfied with brand association and set out to change the game.

Fifteen years ago, while celebrating his 30th birthday in Saint-Tropez in the French Riviera, Burston was introduced to rosé for the first time.

""I was sitting on Nikki Beach surrounded by people drinking what I thought was white Zinfandel, but it turned out to be rosé. From the first drop, I was hooked,"" says Burston.

As far as introductions go, Saint-Tropez was a perfect place to be seduced by the wine.

Donae Burston “It's a rosé party, and everyone is invited.”

The region's local vineyards are known to produce some of the world's top rosés, so it's little surprise that it's the tipple of choice for locals and visitors.

""Drinking rosé in Saint-Tropez was like drinking water in America. I was asked if I wanted a glass of rosé before I was asked if I wanted a glass of water,"" he says.

Rosé for one and all

Burston noted the inclusive nature of rosé in France — ""everyone drinks rosé"" — something he found sorely lacking once back in the United States, where many people still associate it with white Zinfandel.

In France, rosé isn't preferred by any one gender, age, religion or race, Burston explains.

""It's about good times, memories, and good wine any time of the year ... it's a rosé party and everyone is invited.""

Intoxicated by the universal nature of the pink drink, Burston set out to bring the same mentality back to the states.

After meeting the owner of St. Tropez's oldest vineyard, Burston enlisted his help to create La Fete du Rosé.

Boutique wine

Burston says he wanted to create a wine that was respected and to his liking, unlike the sweet mass-produced rosés he felt were dominating the US market.

He had another misconception to push through: The stereotype that Black people only like sweet drinks.

Because of this, Burston says many people, before tasting it, assume his rosé will be sweet.

But au contraire. And that goes both for the tired stereotype and the rosé.

Burston's traditional French-style rosé is dry with notes of melon, dried fruits, bonbon and hazelnut. It's acidic but round on the palate, and it has a noticeably long finish.

""As an African-American man who owns a rosé brand, I emphasized (through marketing) that it's a traditional dry rosé to push through the stereotype [that I'd created a sweet drink],"" says Burston.

The Cuvee he created uses 80% Grenache, 14% Mourvèdre and 6% Syrah grapes — resulting in a crisp medium-bodied wine with a lower alcohol percentage than many other rosés.

Burston's brand is on the affordable side, but at $25 a bottle, it does suggest a certain quality standard.

Brand building

Burston's marketing approach demonstrates his mission to change the tune on rosé, to ultimately get more people drinking it.

Donae Burston “Drinking rosé in Saint-Tropez was like drinking water in America. I was asked if I wanted a glass of rosé before I was asked if I wanted a glass of water.”

""Consumers are willing to try anything, but I know I needed to convince them to try my product — so I went to places they wanted to be,"" says Burston.

With a background on the business and marketing side of the industry, Burston brought the rosé to popular South Beach hotels and restaurants. Cliff Hawkins/Getty Images

He marketed La Fête du Rosé as a lifestyle brand, taking it to Nobu, W South Beach and other popular Miami restaurants and hotels to validate the brand to consumers. Burston organized themed parties and Caribbean festivals to reach different demographics, which he then used for social media to push his goal of inclusion.

Eventually the rosé secured high-profile fans including Michael Strahan.

In addition to creating a catchall brand, Burston wants to encourage consumers to drink rosé all year long.

""I took cues from the French,"" says Burston. ""They drink it (rosé) year-round so my strategy was to show rosé consumed in different seasons, whether it was through an après-ski shoot or explaining how to pair rosé with turkey for Thanksgiving.""

But Burston isn't just trying to get more people into rosé or turn a profit while doing so.

He also wants to give back to the community that supported him.

Giving back

""Traveling the world after college sparked my entrepreneurial spirit, and I want to help give others the same chance through my giveback program,"" he says.

Proceeds from every bottle sold send minority, low-income youths overseas to help them develop language and leadership skills in a globalized world.

""If we as Black business owners don't support the future, who will?"" says Burston.

In light of recent times, Burston has shifted his philanthropic focus to Color of Change, an organization fighting every day for racial justice and other organizations that serve as a resource for minorities pursuing a career in the wine and spirits industry. From now until August, $2 from every bottle (sold via website) will be donated to the organization.

La Fête du Rosé is available online and in stores across certain states including California, Georgia, Florida, New York and recently, Washington, D.C.

Tamara Hardingham-Gill,What happened when luxury hotels swapped tourists for medical workers,"(CNN) — To say the Covid-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the hotel industry is something of an understatement.

Countless big names were forced to close due to safety concerns and plummeting occupancy rates, with many yet to resume business again.

However, some chose to open their doors to doctors, nurses and other key workers fighting against the virus that's taken the lives of at least 500,000 people around the world so far.

In the US, a selection of hotel chains and independent properties offered up at least 3.4 million hotel rooms to healthcare workers on the frontlines.

In New York, America's hardest hit state, the Four Seasons New York was the the first to put up some of the city's medical personnel, welcoming staff from the New York State Nurses Association on April 2.

At least 225 rooms in the 52-story Midtown Manhattan building were made available for a seven-night minimum stay, with the team implementing various protocols, including a single point of entry where each person's temperature is checked.

Many other top hotels followed suit, including the New Yorker , A Wyndham Hotel, which housed a number of medical workers deployed to the city to fight against the virus.

Shadoe Daniels, a physician assistant from Pennsylvania who stayed here for four weeks throughout April, says bedding down at the historic hotel helped to take the pressure off him and his colleagues.

""Honestly every day was exhausting,"" he tells CNN Travel. ""But the New Yorker was very comfortable and convenient.""

""We all had traveled from a long distance away, so we needed a nice place to stay.""

Special guests

But this was far from a typical stay at the historic Art Deco-style hotel situated in Midtown West.

While there was little change to its exterior, the New Yorker looked very different inside.

For instance, its famous ballroom was transformed into a disinfecting zone in which workers would sanitize their hands as well as their shoes, before taking the elevator up to their room one person at a time.

In order to minimize the risk of infection, the New Yorker and other hotels were not able to offer room service or even a restaurant service. Instead, workers were usually provided with meal boxes, which they brought up to their rooms.

Daily housekeeping services were also shelved, however, guests were supplied with an appropriate amount of linen and towels at the start of their stay.

This was a huge relief to traveling physician Angela Mattke, who found herself taking an extended stay at the slightly more low key Residence Inn by Marriott Cleveland Mentor after flying into Cleveland for what was expected to be a short trip.

Although Mattke has stayed at the same hotel several times in the past, she admits to being afraid to let anyone into her room at all when she returned from working nights at the local hospital emergency room.

""I let them in once a week to change the sheets,"" Mattke, a spokesperson for the American College of Emergency Physicians, tells CNN Travel. ""And I would have fresh towels.

""But otherwise I really tried to keep them out, just in case I brought something home from the hospital. Even though I tried very hard not to.""

After a week, she realized she wouldn't be able to return home for a while due to the potential risk of picking up the virus and spreading it to her family and/or air passengers while flying home to Atlanta, and ended up staying for around nine weeks.

Like Daniels, Mattke says the security of the room helped her to feel slightly more at ease while being away from all her family and friends during the height of the virus.

""I was probably the only person in America who was not crazed looking for toilet paper,"" she adds.

""They took good care of me.""

Historic moment

Over in London, Claridge's , a five-star hotel known for hosting visiting royalty, opened to around 40 key medical workers just days after shutting its doors for the first time in its 200-year history.

""Even in the war we didn't close the doors, so it was quite a historic moment in our history,"" says Paula Fitzherbert, director of communications for the Maybourne Hotel Group, which owns London hotels The Connaught and The Berkeley, as well as Claridge's.

""As a London institution, you can't just take the city for the good bits, you have to be there for the bad bits too, and help to support.""

But while the team here felt honored to be hosting healthcare workers who were essentially putting themselves at risks to help save lives, they were disappointed not to be able to provide the usual standard of service a guest at the hotel would receive.

""We had to accept early on that we'd only be able to offer a comforting refuge,"" Fitzherbert tells CNN Travel.

""It wasn't going to be a five-star luxury hotel service, because the hotel wasn't in operation.

""It was very alien for our staff not to be able to extend the normal level of hospitality, but we tried our best to make it as comfortable as possible.""

Claridge's, which is located in Mayfair, also provided meals in boxes and scaled down cleaning services to limit contact between staff and guests.

As guests were staying for longer periods of times than usual, this wasn't much of an issue, and rooms were thoroughly cleaned after each check out and kept empty for three days between guests.

""We asked for longer stay doctors or nurses, so we weren't having to clean the rooms every day,"" explains Fitzherbert.

""The staff would knock on their doors and leave their meals outside.""

Such services proved to be a much-needed lifeline for workers brought to the UK capital during this period, as well as local workers impacted by limited public transport or concerned about infecting loved ones while working with Covid-19 patients.

No-one has a better understanding of this than Teena Ferguson, a senior manager for the Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust in London, who found herself in the unusual position of having to find hotel rooms for hundreds of staff.

""In the last nine weeks, my team has basically become a call center for accommodation,"" explains Ferguson, who has booked around 1,800 rooms for doctors and nurses working in high risk areas since March.

A local partnership was soon formed between the Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust and a number of hotels including the Hilton, Claridge's and the Hyde Park International, in order to ensure rooms were available to staff based at West London hospitals.

'Comforting refuge'

""The hotels have been a home away from home for all the doctors and nurses staying there,"" Ferguson adds.

""Especially at the beginning when no-one knew what the pandemic meant or what it would bring.""

Remco Norden, general manager at the Hilton London Metropole in Edgware Road, says his team were initially intimidated by the prospect of having to look after medical workers while the city was almost at a complete standstill.

""We were anxious and not sure what to expect after the full lockdown [in London],"" Norden explains to CNN Travel.

In order to make sure his workers felt safe, Norden created working ""bubbles"" in which the same staff would work four days on and four days off.

Meanwhile all of the communal areas, such as the lobby bar and restaurant, were closed, bringing about what he describes as an ""apartment complex"" vibe.

""The atmosphere has been completely different,"" adds Norden, who says the hotel has gone from having a thousand people in the building each day to just a few hundred.

But while many of the other hotels closed their doors before reopening solely to health care staff, the Hilton London Metropole has been looking after both standard guests and medical workers simultaneously, as some visitors were unable to checkout due to the pandemic.

""The other guests were all people who were stranded, so everyone at the hotel stayed for at least a month, which was very unusual,"" Norden adds.

""It turned from a corporate machine to a family-style atmosphere between the team and our guests.""

Mutually beneficial

While the health care workers are beyond grateful for the rooms, Ferguson believes the hotels have provided them with much more than just a fancy roof over their heads.

""It's not just about getting us a room at a very reduced rate, if not free,"" she says.

""The hotels have been very thoughtful. Some have made notes of birthdays and put little goodie bags with a mini bottle of champagne outside their doors.

""They've really gone above and beyond.""

According to Ferguson, over 100 of her workers were evicted by their landlords during the pandemic, so the accommodation has been particularly invaluable to them.

""We had about 117 NHS workers who were homeless,"" she adds. ""That was really quite devastating for them.

""To have to come into work and be under that kind of pressure and then not have anywhere to stay.... So, it made a difference to their mental health.""

Thankfully the Covid-19 situation in cities like London and New York appears to be under control for the time being.

Transmission cases have largely dropped and many workers are now able to return to their homes, so the need for hotel rooms has lessened, particularly now that public transport is running regularly again.

""The fear and the risk has greatly reduced,"" says Ferguson. ""So the service isn't required for as many people as it was.

""By the end of June, no-one should be in a hotel.""

While the experience has certainly been of benefit to the medical workers concerned, it's also proven to be a huge advantage to the hotels.

Many of the measures that were initially brought in temporarily, such as ditching buffet services and offering contactless check-in and checkout, have become standard practice in hotels around the world.

""Things have now been given a formal name,"" adds Norden.

The team at Claridge's say being tasked with looking after health care workers battling Covid-19 cases has helped them to prepare for what lies ahead when they're given the go ahead to reopen.

""It's been a very special moment in time and something that will go down as a very proud moment for us,"" adds Fitzherbert.",2020-07-12,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/hotels-swap-tourists-for-medical-workers/index.html
Atika Shubert,The extreme hotel hygiene awaiting tourists in Spain,"(CNN) — It's breakfast time, which means I need to get my temperature checked, put on my face mask, smother my hands in alcohol disinfectant and wear a pair of plastic gloves.

That's all before I have coffee.

Welcome to the Riu Concordia -- part of a hotel chain headquartered in the Spanish holiday island of Mallorca.

It's been specially chosen to greet some of the nearly 11,000 German visitors heading here as part of a pilot program to test coronavirus precautions and reopen Spain's tourism economy.

Mallorca's Riu Concordia is testing new coronavirus measures as part of a pilot program to help restart tourism. Atika Shubert

RIU Hotels has invested in a slew of new protocols.

In our lobby, a thermal camera scans guests when they walk in through the sliding doors: Keep it cool and you get the green light to enter.

But if your temperature gets too high, reception gets a discreet red alert.

""The world is going to see us as an example. A positive example,"" hotel director Sergio Navarro told CNN.

""We feel very brave to show the world our product. And people are doing a fantastic effort so far, guests are responding so well.""

Still, when an alarm goes off in the middle of my coffee, I wonder briefly if the thermal camera has caught someone sneaking in with a fever. Just a fire alarm test, as it turns out.

Hyper hygiene

CNN correspondent Atika Shubert sits down for breakfast wearing a face mask and plastic gloves.

The staff are relentlessly cheerful. When I tell my waiter I'm breakfasting alone, he congratulates me for choosing ""the safest option.""

My cutlery is safety sealed and there are signs all around reminding me to stay two meters apart from other guests.

Navigating the breakfast buffet is tricky though. I need to follow the red arrows on the floor to avoid colliding into others.

Predictably, I go the wrong way in an attempt to get to the fresh fruit.

A smiling attendant kindly guides me back towards the tempting croissants and pastries I had only narrowly escaped on the first round, but only after giving me another squirt of gel disinfectant.

""The world is going to see us as an example. A positive example,"" hotel director Sergio Navarro told CNN.

All the guests around me are German. The hotel has been booked by tour operator TUI, the world's number one tour business.

""Destination Experience Representatives"" with turquoise shirts and the smiling TUI logo mill around the lobby and pool as more reassurance for guests.

The precautions and extra care are understandable -- tourism has plummeted during the pandemic and there's a lot to prove for tour operators and hotels.

""Our first flights from Germany to Mallorca have been sold out within 36 hours and our guests enjoyed the warm welcome,"" TUI said in a statement to CNN.

""We are very pleased to be the first operator to fly holidaymakers to Mallorca again.""

On my way out of the breakfast area, I trip over the mops of no less than two aproned cleaning ladies furiously disinfecting the floors.

One of them proceeds to polish the potted palms in the lobby with alcohol spray.

All this hyper hygiene has not put a damper on the holiday vibes though.

A group of laughing young men heads to the beach toting pink and yellow inflatable beds past the disinfectant stations in the lobby.

In fact, the biggest impediment to holiday fun seems to be the sheer number of media crews desperate to tell a good news story, CNN included. A clutch of German media traveling alongside some holidaymakers has been documenting every step of their vacations.

'It's a little bit complicated'

At breakfast, diners have to follow red arrows to avoid bumping into others, and the cutlery is safely sealed.

""It's a little bit complicated how it all works,"" concedes one tourist, Rene Fuessem, as he tries to remember how many times he'd had his temperature checked.

That hasn't dimmed his enthusiasm for Mallorca.

While basking by the hotel pool, Fuessem says he especially likes the friendly staff and buffet service. All the guaranteed space makes it more enjoyable.

""The beach for example,"" he says. ""Before the beaches were full. The shops were full. Now? Nobody is there.""

Plenty of space to roll out the beach towel is nice.

The hotel is filled with sanitizing stations, including this one in the elevator.

But there's also something sad about seeing bars and clubs boarded up, their terrace chairs stacked inside.

A boardwalk that would normally be thumping with music is eerily quiet.

Across from the glittering blue of our hotel pool, we can see another shuttered hotel with brown sludge collecting inside its emptied out swimming pool.

At the boardwalk, one shop owner selling beachwear sweeps away the miniature dunes of sand that have collected at the store's doors during the lockdown.

The limited number of guests means there's plenty of space at the hotel pool.

He doesn't expect to sell anything, he says. ""I'm just bored of sitting at home.""

No-one knows how much of the economy can recover by reopening the islands to tourism again.

Eliza Mackintosh,"Amid the pandemic, a group of asylum seekers was moved to a small, rural Irish town. Then they started testing positive for Covid-19","(CNN) Misha was living in a hotel in a leafy suburb of Ireland's capital city under the country's controversial asylum seeker accommodation system when a letter arrived.

She had been waiting months for a decision to be made on her asylum status. But the letter wasn't about that.

Misha, and dozens of other asylum seekers at the Dublin hotel were notified that they would be moved to a rural town over 200 miles away, on the west coast of Ireland, due to concerns over Covid-19 spreading through the accommodation, which was also shared by paying guests. She had less than 24 hours to pack her things.

When she was transferred to the Skellig Star accommodation center in Cahersiveen, County Kerry, on March 18, she was hopeful it would be safe. But, after arriving and being told to bunk with another asylum seeker she didn't know, she began to fear the worst.

""I was scared for my life,"" said Misha, who asked that her real name not be used for fear it might impact her asylum claim.

About 100 people in total were transferred from a handful of centers, including from one Dublin hotel where a guest from Italy had reportedly contracted the virus.

Just days after they arrived, one of the residents started showing symptoms, according to three people CNN talked to. Then the rumors started.

""I was scared for my life."" Misha

The Cahersiveen community had been given just as little time to prepare; locals found out only a few days before that the Skellig Star — rebuilt in 2006 on the promise of drawing tourists with a swimming pool and other leisure facilities — was being converted into accommodation for asylum seekers.

Despite their lack of consultation and concerns over losing business from the only major hotel in town, people in Cahersiveen welcomed the group, bringing them clothes and toys. But when news began swirling that asylum seekers were getting sick, and still shopping in the local stores, people in the small town began to panic.

""Rural Ireland would love to have these people living in the community ... they'd be more than welcome,"" said Jack Fitzpatrick, chairman of the Cahersiveen Community and Business Alliance. ""But, this is not the way to do it, to plunk 100 people into a very congested hotel in the midst of a pandemic.""

The outbreak, which swiftly spread through the hotel, infecting 25 people at its peak, was declared over on May 20 by Ireland's Health Service Executive (HSE), but local residents and asylum seekers are continuing to push for the center to be shut down, joining together as a united front in a series of demonstrations.

Asylum seekers at the Skellig Star hold a banner protesting the handling of the Covid-19 outbreak on May 7.

Under a system known as Direct Provision, overseen by Ireland's Department of Justice and Equality and operated by private businesses on lucrative contracts , asylum seekers are housed in emergency accommodation while they wait to find out if they will be granted refugee status and permission to stay in the country.

Calls for reform of the system, introduced initially as an emergency measure by the state in 1999 after a sudden increase in asylum applications, have coincided with sweeping, global protests for racial justice following the killing of George Floyd in the US.

Asylum seekers — many of whom are from African countries — have condemned Direct Provision for ""institutionalized racism"" on the part of the government, arguing that no one else in the country is treated in the same way as they are.

While their appeal is being assessed, they're provided with free accommodation, food and utilities, and have access to healthcare and education, but they have almost no autonomy and cannot choose where they live. And they are unable to apply for a work permit until at least eight months into their application process — expected to survive on a weekly allowance of €38.80 ($43) instead.

Commenting on the comparison between Direct Provision and the murder of George Floyd earlier this month, Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar conceded that while some Direct Provision accommodation was substandard and needed to change, it ""ultimately is a service offered by the state ... involves people being provided with free accommodation, food, heat, lighting, health care, education, and also some spending money.""

""It's not the same thing as a man being killed by the police.""

Decisions on asylum cases in Ireland can take years, a fact that has been criticized by the United Nations Refugee Agency , which recently called for the process to be sped up. And rejection rates are high — around 70%, according to recent figures . Dozens of people have died waiting, according to a Freedom of Information request from The Irish Catholic

Not fit for purpose

Ireland's Fianna Fail , Fine Gael and Green Party struck a draft deal to form a new coalition government on Monday, which, if ratified by the members of the three parties, will end months of political stalemate since the country's election in February. It will also inject urgency into reforming the Irish asylum system. One of the key commitments outlined in the agreement is a pledge to end Direct Provision and replace it with an accommodation policy centered on a not-for-profit approach.

Liam Thornton, a law lecturer and Direct Provision expert, greeted the decision with cautious optimism. ""After 20-plus years of government denial that anything much was wrong, it's interesting to see,"" he told CNN. ""While we haven't been here before, it is implementation that will be key.""

Thornton tweeted : ""Direct Provision is one of the darkest chapters in the Dept of Justice history. But it takes people to design, administer, implement such awfulness. New mindsets needed ASAP.""

Asylum seekers, human rights campaigners and legal experts such as Thornton say the pandemic has shone a spotlight on structural problems that have long existed in Ireland's asylum system. Against the backdrop of Covid-19, the often crowded, poor conditions have become that much more apparent.

""HSE has been advising us, and everybody, on social distancing, but you cannot social distance where there is no space,"" Misha said.

""We were sharing bedrooms with strangers. We were sharing the dining room. We were sharing the salt shakers. We were sharing the lobby. We were sharing everything. And if you looked at the whole situation, you cannot really say that it was fit for purpose.""

Skellig Star residents, locked inside the center during quarantine, chant ""move us out"" on April 29.

Misha says she watched in horror as people started falling sick around her, before being pulled into makeshift isolation rooms. The first suspected case of Covid-19 in the center was reported as early as March 24, the Justice Department has conceded, adding that the person did not test positive. They did not say when the test was conducted.

According to asylum seekers and a previous manager, testing of asylum seekers didn't start until weeks later in mid-April. After positive cases were confirmed, all residents at the Skellig Star were ordered to stay inside and quarantine.

""I have verifiable evidence of a written communication from the Skellig Star to the Department of Justice and Equality on 24 March confirming a suspected case of Covid-19. The resident concerned was placed in isolation on 20 March, one day after arrival in Cahersiveen,"" Member of Parliament for Kerry, Norma Foley, said in a special parliamentary committee hearing on the government's Covid-19 response.

""The timeline might not be of importance to either the HSE or the Department of Justice and Equality but it is very important to the residents of the Skellig Star and the community of Cahersiveen. This timeline confirms unequivocally that Covid-19 was transported by bus on 18 March and 19 March to the Skellig Star and the community of Cahersiveen.""

In a statement to CNN regarding the timeline, the Department said it had made an ""honest mistake"" in failing to receive the March 24 communication and that ""there was no attempt by the Department ... to intentionally mislead or conceal the facts"" related to the outbreak.

""Our biggest fear is a second wave ... We're afraid it will spread like wildfire in the hotel again, but next time it may also go through the community."" Jack Fitzpatrick

After her roommate tested positive and was taken away to self-isolate at another center, Misha thought that someone would move her, so that the room could be disinfected. When no one came, she said she raised her concerns with an HSE worker on site, who told her there was no reason to worry.

""It was an embarrassment to my intelligence,"" Misha said. She tested positive 10 days later.

Ireland's Justice Department told CNN that an HSE Development Worker was at the hotel to monitor the health of residents and staff throughout the outbreak, and is now providing more general support, including accessing mainstream health services and integrating in the local community.

The Department said it was continuing to work closely with the HSE and Cahersiveen center managers to ensure the wellbeing of all residents and staff, including offering all single residents their own bedrooms and providing enhanced cleaning services. The center also intends to provide self-catering facilities so that residents can cook in their rooms, instead of eating together in a communal dining room.

Townbe, the company that operates Skellig and three other Direct Provision centers, did not respond to CNN's request for comment. The Justice Department said it was unable to comment on the value of the contract with Townbe until after two years, because of commercial sensitivity.

But the conditions detailed by the Justice Department differ dramatically with what was described to CNN by two asylum seekers and one previous manager at the center.

Fears of second outbreak

When Misha and the other asylum seekers arrived at the Skellig Star in mid-March, they said they found a holiday hotel that was not ready for guests, or prepared to cope with the coronavirus. The central heating was broken, the bedrooms — which were smaller than standard size — were not deep cleaned, isolation rooms had not been established, personal protective equipment was not made available and staff had not been vetted by An Garda Síochána, Ireland's national police service.

Bulelani Mfaco, an activist who has been living in Direct Provision since 2017, detailed some of these conditions in a report for the Movement of Asylum Seekers in Ireland (MASI) , laying out recommendations for wide-ranging reforms of the system. Top of his list: Guaranteeing a suitable standard of living that protects the physical and mental health.

Skellig Star residents in quarantine wave to locals protesting outside on May 7.

""Cahersiveen demonstrates to us that the model doesn't work,"" Mfaco said. ""Giving vulnerable people to hoteliers, who have no training. No thought was given to the risk of gathering all these people, cramming them into a bus and bringing them to a remote village far from any healthcare services.""

Jack Fitzpatrick and other locals are fearful that those healthcare services will be overstretched if another outbreak hits.

The closest major hospital to Cahersiveen, which has a population of around 1,000, is 40 miles away. There are only two doctors in Cahersiveen, and one ambulance serves the entire remote Iveragh Peninsula, where the town is situated.

""We were very lucky that nobody died in the hotel, and that we managed to stop the virus going widespread in the community,"" said Fitzpatrick.

""Our biggest fear is a second wave ... We're afraid it will spread like wildfire in the hotel again, but next time it may also go through the community. So we are basically doing our best to try to get them to close it down and move the people to sort accommodation.""

People in the town are demanding the resignation of Justice Minister Charlie Flanagan, who they say misled the public over the Covid-19 outbreak at the Skellig Star.

""We should be given, at least, the status of permission to remain so we can have our own-door accommodation, cook our own meals and keep ourselves and our families safe from the virus."" Azwar Fuard

Flanagan has apologized to the people of Cahersiveen , but said his department had no knowledge of the infection in the Dublin hotel before transferring asylum seekers from it.

In the wake of the outbreak, Flanagan has asked the former Secretary General to undertake a review of the Department's response to Covid-19 in direct provision centers like Cahersiveen.

Ciaran Quinlan, of Cahersiveen, told CNN he is seeking an injunction to close the center. He says he wants ""to help these people to get their own front-door accommodation, and to move them out of the unsuitable accommodation that they're in.""

Azwar Fuard, an asylum seeker who has been acting as a spokesman for the 70 residents remaining at the center, is calling on Flanagan to grant the Skellig Star residents amnesty to remain in Ireland.

Fuard, originally from Sri Lanka, was moved from the same hotel as Misha in Dublin with his young family just as they were starting to feel settled. Both Fuard and his wife had found work in the capital, made friends, and their three-year-old daughter had started going to pre-school. To be ripped away from yet another life, he said, was like a double trauma.

Now he says the family of three is largely confined to a 12ft x 13ft room, with an ensuite bathroom and no cooking or washing facilities.

""We should be given, at least, the status of permission to remain so we can have our own-door accommodation, cook our own meals and keep ourselves and our families safe from the virus,"" Fuard said.",2020-06-16,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/16/europe/ireland-asylum-direct-provision-coronavirus-intl/index.html
Analysis Luke Mcgee,Cracks in the Trump-Europe relationship are turning into a chasm,"London (CNN) For more than 70 years, the transatlantic alliance has served as the unshakable foundation of European stability and underpinned the values of the US-led Western order. In 2020, it appears that relationship is being rethought on both sides of the Atlantic.

Earlier this week, the European Union declined to include US in its list of "" safe countries ,"" meaning that American travelers will be unwelcome inside the bloc for the foreseeable future, due to the eyewatering US coronavirus infection numbers. Controversially, the list includes China -- the country where the virus originated -- on the condition of reciprocal arrangements.

EU officials insist that the decision was not political and based entirely on epidemiological evidence, in the hope this would pacify US President Donald Trump, a man who has attacked the bloc on several occasions.

However, others privately concede that had Brussels wanted to make the pill more palatable for an American audience, they could have added a sugar coating. ""In the past, I can see that we might have not included China in order to keep the US happy,"" says an EU diplomat not authorized to speak on record about how the decision was made.

It might seem a stretch to take this incident as evidence of a rupture in transatlantic relations, until you place it in the current geopolitical context. It's no secret that Washington takes less of an interest in European affairs these days. And it's well known that European nations actively seek greater diplomatic autonomy from America. This is especially true for the 27 member states of the European Union.

One of the ways Brussels thinks it can distance itself from DC is by engaging with China as a strategic and economic partner, decreasing its reliance on one of the world's superpowers by balancing its relationship with the other.

In the past few years, Brussels has stuck to its guns on big, international matters as Trump tore everything up. Think of the Paris Climate Accord, the Iran Nuclear deal, 5G , and you start to see a pattern of behavior in which the EU could be perceived to have sided with China over its oldest ally. Sure, it might be a ungenerous read of the situation, given the deep, established bond between Europe and the US, but in this context, any perceived friendliness to Beijing punches a very real bruise.

""Knowing what we know about China's data, how it has behaved during the pandemic and the White House's stance, I think in another world we would have kept them off,"" says the diplomat. That other world he refers to isn't simply the world before Trump took office.

Controversially, the EU has included China -- the country where the novel coronavirus originated -- on its list of ""safe countries"" on condition of reciprocal agreements.

One Brussels official who works on EU foreign policy but is not authorized to speak on the record said the shift away from Europe as a geopolitical priority began under former US president Barack Obama.

""Obama didn't have as close an interest in the Middle East as previous presidents, which is geographically more of a European problem. And he was shifting his priorities from Europe to China and Asia,"" the official said.

However, longstanding observers of the alliance accept it has been strained over the past four years -- and will worsen still if Donald Trump beats former vice president Joe Biden in this year's US election. ""Trump considers the EU, especially Germany, an economic and trade rival, which means tensions can be expected in the case he gets a second term,"" says Velina Tchakarova, from the Austrian Institute for European and Security Policy.

She says that as the EU is taking steps toward ""building stronger autonomy in the field of security and defence,"" Trump tries to ""undermine such efforts through his attacks on the European NATO members as well as through economic and trade measures.""

The Brussels official explains that Trump's ""break from multilateralism"" on big international matters like Iran, coupled with the US taking ""less responsibility in European security"" has accelerated European thinking to take a step away from America and ""do our own thing on the world stage.""

This characterization of a hostile US administration that goes out of its way to avoid working with Europeans is one that the EU diplomat recognizes. ""The problem is, officials in DC who want to work with Europe, while in contact, don't have the mandate from the government to engage in any serious way. They have hung on as long as they can but if we get a second Trump term, then we are in real trouble.""

President Trump has criticized the bloc on several occasions.

This, according to Tchakarova, is why ""EU institutions and leaders of the member states hope that Joe Biden will be elected in November ... he is in favor of multilateralism and the expectation is that he will strengthen the ties between the USA and Europe.""

CNN approached numerous officials from the EU institutions and diplomats on both sides of the Atlantic for comment. Most declined to comment; several conceded that they believed this to be the case. One European diplomat said: ""We'll dance with whoever is on the dance floor, but it doesn't take a genius to see that the EU-US cooperation is currently underperforming.""

Asked to comment on a potential pivot by the EU away from its historical ties with the US, a State Department spokesperson said: ""The United States and the EU share a strong, enduring partnership based on common democratic values and governance, respect for human rights and the rule of law, deep economic ties, and a commitment to Transatlantic prosperity and security. This longstanding partnership is vital as we coordinate on a host of international efforts.""

However, a potential Biden victory would provide no quick fix for the transatlantic partnership. ""The question is not really if you can get the relationship back to where it was, but if we can persuade the US to re-join the Western order,"" says the EU diplomat.

""The US and EU geopolitical pivots on Asia, the Middle East and trade have respectively already begun. The difference at the moment is we think the West should be pivoting as one.""

And even if Biden did go back to Obama-era policy on Europe, there is no guarantee that in four years' time he wouldn't be replaced by someone even more radical than Trump. ""The fundamental shifts going on in the US will probably remain and we have to adjust, making the best of the relationship we can. These shifts, they are structural and they are not just based on one person,"" says the Brussels official.

Of course, none of this means that the transatlantic alliance will stop being important. It will remain central to what the West represents, and the US will always be a more important ally to Europe than China ever could be. Besides, the EU's big plans to engage more with China were dealt a major blow by the Covid-19 outbreak.

However, that fading veneer of warmth -- with Europe seeking a new place on the world stage as the US's global role becomes inherently more unpredictable -- can only be seen as good news for those that these historic Western powers were united against not so long ago.",2020-07-04,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/04/europe/trump-europe-relationship-intl/index.html
Matt Villano,Are cell phone calls on airplane flights inevitable?,"(CNN) — Ah, holiday travel . Between huge crowds and weather delays, flying during this time of year is hectic. Now close your eyes and imagine the entire scenario with one additional annoyance: Loud talkers yammering into their cell phones at 35,000 feet.

Don't worry -- this potentially ear-splitting scenario isn't a reality yet. At least not in the United States . But it could be soon. Some even say it's just a year or two away.

The technology to support midair cell phone calls exists right now.

Just about every plane that offers WiFi has the bandwidth to support voice over the internet, and several international airlines allow voice calls on certain routes already. Still, at least on domestic US flights, voice calls are forbidden for four distinct reasons: flight attendants, public perception, concerns about safety and US law.

Airline officials won't even consider in-flight cell-phone calls until or unless they feel there is overwhelming demand from customers to provide the service, according to Henry Harteveldt, president of Atmosphere Research Group, a travel industry analysis firm in San Francisco. Even then, airlines still may not cave in.

""No matter how you look at it, allowing cell phone calls on planes is controversial,"" he says. ""These are precisely the kinds of issues airlines tend to avoid addressing unless they must.""

Keeping cabins calm

Flight attendants already mediate many passenger disputes. Shutterstock

Without question, flight attendants are the biggest barrier to allowing voice calls in the air.

Pretty much across the board, people who work in airplane cabins say the idea of allowing passengers unfettered in-flight phone use would lead to chaos, conflict and downright craziness in flight. As such, they oppose phone use vociferously.

Flight attendants are already tasked with managing overhead bin use, monitoring drink intake among unruly passengers and mediating fights between seat-recliners and passengers who don't recline.

Taylor Garland, spokesperson for the Association of Flight Attendants, a union representing 50,000 flight attendants at 20 airlines, says her colleagues don't want to take on any more policing of passengers' social behaviors.

""We are strongly against voice calls on planes,"" she wrote in a recent email. In another, she doubled down with all caps: ""NO CELL PHONES.""

Flight attendants' opposition is significant.

They've had major influence on certain decisions regarding domestic passenger travel. In recent years, they've been at the forefront of efforts to get airlines to control unruly passengers. In the 1980s, they led the charge against cigarettes in cabins, which ultimately led to full-fledged bans on in-flight smoking by 2000.

On the issue of in-flight cell phone calls, flight attendants say that passengers inevitably would offend some neighbors by being too loud, and arguments would surely follow.

Cassandra Michele Brown, a flight attendant who works for Frontier Airlines, adds that unfettered cell phone use in midair likely would prevent passengers from complying with flight attendant instructions in the event of an emergency.

""At the end of the day, our job is to evacuate an aircraft in 90 seconds or less,"" says Brown, who is based out of Las Vegas.

""If you're a passenger on my flight, no matter how good you might be at multitasking, you're not going to be able to follow my step-by-step instructions to evacuate if you're focusing on your phone.""

Passengers advocating for quiet

Among the travel experts and the traveling public, feelings about allowing voice calls in the air are mixed.

Much like the flight attendants, a vocal contingent of passengers has emerged as opponents of loud noise, insisting that an open environment for in-flight cell-phone calls will create an ""annoying"" cacophony of chaos in the skies and undoubtedly trigger disagreements about what volume is appropriate.

Harteveldt, the analyst, is in this camp, and says research recently conducted by his firm estimates that less than 5% of all domestic air passengers want to use their cell phones in midair.

""I don't want to be forced to overhear someone else's conversation if it's avoidable,"" he says. ""It's bad enough when you find yourself in that situation at a coffee shop or in a hotel lobby. In an airplane at cruising altitude, in a situation where you can't do anything or go anywhere to escape, it would be horrendous.""

Other passengers say privacy also would be a concern, since even first-class passengers are packed tightly into airplane seats for the duration of most flights.

Business travelers, however, seem to be more utilitarian in their thinking.

Paul Forgue, a consultant who manages performance improvement for a global private equity portfolio company and travels 40 weeks a year, says he could see situations in which in-flight phone use could come in handy.

""For those work emergencies when you really need to have contact with someone, it would be fantastic to know you could pick up your phone and do that from the plane,"" says Forgue, who is based in San Francisco. ""In those situations where you need to talk to a colleague about something you can't articulate via text or email, it'd be perfect -- provided people don't take advantage.""

One strategy Forgue says airlines could implement to allow in-flight cell phone calls: Special areas of the plane for those passengers who wish to use their phones and special areas for those passengers who do not.

This is the plan deployed by Amtrak and various commuter rail systems across the country. For the most part -- save for the occasional abusers or overflow problems on crowded trips -- it works.

Is the technology safe?

Newer planes are designed to not be affected by passengers' technology. Shutterstock

The story of in-cabin calls from personal electronic devices is a colorful saga that goes back decades.

In the 1980s and 1990s, when cellular technology became mainstream, use on planes went relatively unchecked. If you're 40 or older, you probably remember the seatback handsets available to anyone with the swipe of a credit card for upwards of $4 or $5 per minute. These essentially were early public cell phones.

Even after the turn of the millennium, cell phone calls were mostly unregulated; victims of the 9/11 terror attacks were able to call their loved ones from the hijacked airplanes before the planes crashed.

The rise of smartphones changed everything.

As phones became more sophisticated, industry insiders worried about the possibility of a phone's radio transmitter interfering with certain equipment in the cockpit and therefore rendering some of the equipment unreliable.

Many of these concerns were stoked by published papers about the potential effects of electromagnetic interference to flight navigation and communication systems. The gist of those reports: Some devices had the potential to interfere with unshielded cockpit instruments, and that such interference could in worst-case scenarios affecting the regular operation of the plane.

Airline experts subsequently have noted that this was an issue with older devices on older aircraft.

Seth Miller, an industry analyst and the owner of the PaxEx.areo blog, said newer phones operate at much higher frequencies, and newer planes are designed to not be affected by the amount of electronics that passengers bring when they fly.

""There was one documented example of something affecting depth [instruments] in one very specific old (airline) model when under certain circumstances, says Miller. ""But nobody was able to determine with certainty if it was a phone leaking radio frequency when it shouldn't have been -- or an instrument screen not being shielded from certain frequencies when it should have been.""

""The reality is that new technology and new equipment have all but eliminated this problem,"" says Miller. ""There's no longer any technical reason for people to not use cell phones on planes.""

Internationally, in fact, a handful of airlines have inked deals with third-party vendors to offer and allow satellite-based internet services that support voice calls via cell phones. Some of these include British Airways, Emirates and Etihad.

Viasat, a communication company based in Carlsbad, California, is one of those vendors. Don Buchman, the company's vice president and general manager of commercial aviation, says his company's systems could carry voice calls over the internet tomorrow if airline customers wanted to do so.

""Most airlines have the ability to permit devices to make voice calls but choose not to,"" he says. ""When the industry is ready, it probably will be as simple as flipping a switch.""

Regulatory, practical obstacles

Texting is already permitted on some airlines. Shutterstock

Though it's not technically illegal to make voice calls from cell phones on commercial flights, there are two major regulatory restrictions that have that same effect.

First, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the US federal agency that oversees US telecommunications transmissions, prohibits airborne use of the two of the most frequently used cellular bands.

The agency recently considered a proposal that would have allowed air passengers to use their phones for calls at high altitude. This policy was introduced in 2013 by then FCC-Chairman Tom Wheeler, but current FCC Chairman Ajit Pai quashed it in 2017. At the time, Pai said in a statement he did not think the proposal gave travelers what he thought they wanted.

""Taking it off the table permanently will be a victory for Americans who, like me, value a moment of quiet at 30,000 feet,"" he said.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has taken a similar stance.

Section 403 of the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 states, ""The Secretary of Transportation shall issue regulations to prohibit an individual on an aircraft from engaging in voice communications using a mobile communications device during a flight of that aircraft in scheduled passenger interstate or intrastate air transportation.""

The law allows exceptions for flight crews and law enforcement officers.

Granted, the push for making cell-phone voice calls might subside on its own. Texting already is allowed on many US domestic carriers -- and more and more business travelers are embracing group text services as replacements for conference calls. Then, of course, there's email, which is also available for passengers who pony up the cash for access to standard in-flight WiFi.

Who calls people anyway?

What's more, millennials and younger generations rarely talk on the phone.

Miller, from the PaxEx.areo blog, predicts that regulatory agencies eventually will remove the limits on in-flight cell phone calls, leaving it up to individual airlines to decide whether this is a service they want to provide.

""When there are safety reasons for something not to happen, the aviation world always will try to err on the side of safety,"" he says. ""On the flip side, now that we know there's no risk associated with cell phone use in-flight, the FAA and the FCC might change the rules, and if they do, it's not a given that airlines will embrace it.""

Despite the relative technical viability of in-flight cell phone calls, it still could be years before travelers may have to grapple with them in real life given all the opposition.

Maggie Hiufu Wong,"'Hamlet' in the skies? The story behind Taiwan's newest airline, STARLUX","(CNN) — Debuting its first flights in January 2020, Taiwanese start-up STARLUX Airlines could be the first new player in 30 years to upend the island's duopoly aviation market.

And even before the carrier, dubbed Taiwan's first luxury boutique airline, set its first aircraft into the air, it's been creating a stir.

Eleven minutes after opening ticket sales online on December 16, the Taipei-based carrier sold out all seats on its first three flights -- Taipei-Macau, Taipei-Penang and Taipei-Danang.

But both aviation watchers and the general public are abuzz for another reason: A succession drama involving STARLUX founder Chang Kuo-wei that's so juicy he's being referred to as the aviation industry's ""Prince Hamlet"" by local media.

This Shakepearean tale took root in 2016, when Chang Yung-fa, founder of Taiwan's Evergreen Group and airline EVA Airways, passed away at the age of 88, sparking a battle over who would take over one of the island's biggest family-run conglomerates.

Chang, 49, who had been the chairman of EVA since 2013, revealed that his late father had named him the successor of parent company Evergreen in his will.

A well-loved figure in the aviation industry, known for his outspokenness and expertise, the son had experience working for EVA Airways as both an aircraft technician and a pilot.

But being the youngest son and the only child of Chang Yung-fa's second wife, Chang Kuo-wei's promotion ignited a family feud. He was soon ousted from EVA as chairman at a board meeting called by fellow family members.

A few months later, he announced that he was going to launch his own airline -- STARLUX Airlines.

""He doesn't think that he's 'Hamlet'""

Local media have called it a Hamlet-like retaliation plan.

The anticipation of the new airline's launch has grown as both EVA Airways and China Airlines, Taiwan's two main airlines, have been plagued by strikes and internal conflicts.

But according to the team at STARLUX, Chang isn't out for retribution.

""He doesn't think that he is 'Hamlet',"" K.W. Nieh, STARLUX's chief communication officer, tells CNN Travel. ""This has nothing to do with revenge.""

""Because of his passion for aviation, Chang merely wants to build an ideal airline that reflects his style after breaking from the shackles of Evergreen Group. He is building STARLUX to fulfill the expectations of his late father.""

CNN Travel has reached out to EVA Air for comment.

Whether or not Taipei-based STARLUX can outdo the other major players on the island remains to be seen, but it's certainly upped Taiwan's aviation game.

The airline is introducing a new generation of passenger aircraft, including the A321neo and A350-1000, ""both debuting for the first time in Taiwan,"" says Nieh.

Indeed, STARLUX is the first Taiwanese airline to be equipped with A321neos -- all 10 of them will be delivered by the end of 2021. STARLUX signed Taiwan's largest single Airbus purchase agreement, purchasing 17 A350XWB aircraft in March 2019.

Chang himself piloted STARLUX's first A321neo to Taipei from Hamburg last month.

""The fleet will grow to 27 aircraft by the end of 2024 and 50 by the end of 2030,"" adds Nieh.

The interior of the narrow body cabin, designed by BMW's Designworks studio, is fitted with sleek seats, leather headrests and inflight entertainment systems across all classes.

Economy class seats will feature a 10.1-inch 720p screen while business class seats -- equipped with narrow-body seats that can recline into an 82-inch fully flat bed -- will offer a 15.6-inch 1080p inflight entertainment system.

Free Wi-Fi with basic access (texting only for economy passengers) will be offered for both classes on all STARLUX flights -- also a first in Taiwan.

Local touches abound as well. A unique cabin scent -- with notes of woods, leather and florals -- has been created by Taiwan-grown fragrance brand P.Seven. The airline's crew uniform, which bears themes of retro-futuristic travel in the 40s and 50s, is the product of local designer Sean Yin.

No fare war: STARLUX will charge more than competitors

Aspiring to be the Emirates of Asia, STARLUX vows to provide premium service, too.

At a recent press event, Chang said STARLUX Airlines will not start a fare war. Instead, its tickets will be reasonable but more expensive than its competitors.

""We consider flying as an enjoyable part of the journey,"" adds Nieh. ""We offer top-notch and exquisite services. It differentiates STARLUX from other companies in the market.

""We position ourselves as a boutique airline, targeting the higher-end market. We have introduced the most advanced aircraft models with the latest aviation technology and seats. We offer exquisite service items so the fare will be slightly higher than the other airlines.""

According to aviation expert CK Law, senior adviser of the Department of Aviation Policy at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, this unique positioning is a clever move for STARLUX.

""Many new airlines have been tapping into the low-cost sector in the market, particularly in this part of the world,"" says Law.

""That's definitely the major trend. There should be reasonable demand for the high-end passenger segment of the market.""

But he expects the new airline will still have an impact on airfares in the long run.

""From the passengers' point of view, there will be new and substantial benefits for them to have new choices and possible new fare reductions in the longer term. There'll be competition for better services on the plane,"" says Law.

Potential cut-throat competition

Taiwan has been enjoying healthy passenger growth numbers as well as flights in recent years.

Boeing has estimated that Taiwan's aviation demand will be stronger than the Northeast Asia region's annual average -- 2% over the next two decades -- as a whole.

But is there enough space to accommodate another major airline?

""A new full-service airline would definitely introduce a lot of new competition to a traditional aviation market like Taiwan,"" says Law.

""Whether the new airline or even the existing airlines can survive because of this will mainly depend on how fast the market will grow and whether the new demand could absorb or balance with the new supply capacity.

""Otherwise, that could be a cut-throat competition and there could be casualties.""

One of the biggest questions is: Can a newcomer carve a spot for itself in the long-haul and transit markets, the two markets STARLUX plans to explore?

""I would expect a good, high load factor being achieved for the short haul tourism markets but the long haul destinations, which have [major competition in Taiwan,] would definitely be more challenging,"" says Law.

""It won't be easy for new airlines to join a reputable alliance, to start with. Without being a member of an alliance, it won't be easy at all to get transit passengers. But it can be a long-term goal,"" says Law.

Nieh, on the other hand, is confident.

""The development of STARLUX doesn't solely rely on the Taiwan market. Taipei has a superior geographical location -- you can reach major Asian cities within five hours"" he says.

""Located in a central position connecting North America, North Asia and Southeast Asia, Taiwan has the best foundation to develop as an aviation hub. By introducing and building its hardware and software, the aviation industry of Taiwan will hopefully become the transportation hub of Asia, strengthen its transit services and bring a large number of international passengers to Taiwan.""

Nieh points to a recent study by the Taiwan government's National Audit Office, which claims only 10% of the island's inbound travelers are transit passengers.

""Comparing to Hong Kong, Incheon, Shanghai and Tokyo, there is room for market development,"" says Nieh. ""We're very certain about this part.""

The initial rush for ticket sales has been good news for STARLUX.

""Tickets to Macau sold out in six minutes; tickets to Danang sold out in nine and tickets to Penang sold out in 11 minutes,"" Liwen Liu, director of STARLUX's corporate communications division tells CNN.

""All 188 seats on each of the three flights.

""We're very happy about it. We had our expectations but the response has been better than what we expected,"" says Liu.

Shana Clarke,Copenhagen's new Metro is a thing of beauty,"Copenhagen (CNN) — In Copenhagen, traffic is usually caused by the two-wheel variety of transportation: the bicycle.

Ever since bicycles were imported into Denmark from France in 1869, they have become the main form of transportation in the Scandinavian city. In the 1920s, it wasn't unusual to see both the working class as well as high society pedaling through the streets. But with the opening of the Metro's new M3 Cityring line, commuters have a new way of getting around.

While Copenhagen's Metro has always been rather efficient, many neighborhoods lacked stations, and thus, accessibility.

In addition, a growing population of about 10,000 new residents per year is taxing the buses and trains already in circulation. In a city of 650,000 people, about 200,000 commute on the Metro daily, sometimes in conjunction with a bike during their journey.

Greater accessibility

Cityring, a 15.5-kilometer (approximately 9.63 miles) circular line with 17 new stops — which nearly doubles the number of existing stations — now connects outlying neighborhoods that radiate far from the city center. Residents won't need to rely on their bikes to get around, a boon especially during Copenhagen's hygge-inducing winters.

The impetus for the project was twofold, according to Henrik Ploughmann Olsen, CEO of Copenhagen Metro. ""First of all, it was a question of improving public transport, making it more efficient and of better quality,"" he said. ""But it was also about city development in other areas outside of the city center.""

Courtesy The Copenhagen Metro

Public squares were constructed, with 150 benches and 800 trees, were installed around the 17 new stations. The plazas not only allow access to the Metro, but will hopefully encourage more commerce and housing.

""We see that it attracts shops but also offices and service-oriented businesses,"" said Olsen.

Building the line was not without its challenges.

Olsen acknowledged that the eight years of construction impeded traffic and generally disrupted people's daily lives. ""We had the machinery right outside people's windows for quite a substantial number of years,"" he said.

Technical issues also challenged tunnel designers. They had to build around older structures with shaky foundations, such as the historic Frederik's Church, a.k.a. Marble Church, at the Marmorkirken station.

Controlling groundwater was also imperative during construction.

""A lot of the houses in the inner part of the old city center are actually founded on wooden piles from the 17th century or 18th century,"" explained Olsen, ""If you remove the groundwater from those piles, they'll rot.""

In addition, builders had to deftly maneuver around existing Metro tunnels--but Olsen proudly notes the extension was completed without causing any shutdowns to the current system.

Shiny, new rails

The new M3 line allows Copenhagen to compete on an international level. Reginaldo Sales/Metro Company

The line itself is a thing of beauty; sleek and gleaming like a seal shimmying through water, this shiny new rail line is runs automatically without any conductors.

The system operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year -- a rare service offered by only a small handful of cities worldwide, including New York City, Chicago, and Melbourne -- and a full rotation around the line takes 24 minutes. Average speed is about 40 kilometers per hour (approximately 25 miles per hour) but when a train hits top speed, it can cruise at 90 kilometer an hour (55 miles per hour).

Unlike older stations, all the new stops are outfitted with two elevators instead of one and the incline of stairs was reduced to make going up and down flights less taxing. For today's iTouch culture, screens by ticket machines supply riders with route information and maps.

Not just easy on the ride, Cityring's stations are easy on the eyes.

Glass and light are key design elements and stations were designed to integrate with their surroundings. At the Frederiksberg Allé station, for example, the green interior color scheme is a segue to the outdoor park that greets riders when they reach street level.

Cleanliness and efficiency are two tenets of the Metro system. Revenue generated from ticket sales is reinvested into maintenance, and quarterly surveys of passengers give Metro operators direction on what's working, what's not and where they need to direct funds.

Bike-friendly

The Cityring doesn't want to compete with bikes, but instead integrate itself into existing transportation infrastructure. ""Metro actually supports the thoughts of the having bikes being either last mile or first mile mode of transportation, so you could use it in combination,"" said Olsen.

Bikes are allowed on the Metro during non-rush hours, and cellars at every station provide storage for the two-wheeled vehicles when not in use. Screens at exit points announce nearby bus and train departures for easy connections.

This shiny new rail line is conductor-less and runs automatically. Reginaldo Sales/Metro Company

While these features have residents excited about the new system, Olsen believes ""the most important thing is that you don't have to look up time table,"" he said. ""You can just go through the station and there'll be a train right after."" To him, freedom from the shackles of a schedule exemplifies the ease of using the Metro.

The new M3 line — and the expansion of the Metro in general — not only services the city internally, but allows Copenhagen to compete on an international level. Citing Hamburg, Germany, and Stockholm, Sweden as nearby rivals, Olsen hopes to attract both businesses and tourists to Copenhagen via opportunities presented by the Metro.

With the opening of the M3 Cityring, ridership is expected to rise from 65 million to 122 million by 2020, and two extensions to the existing M4 line are due to open over the next five year.

While projections are ambitious, Olsen's definition of success is more modest.",2020-07-12,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/metro-cityring-copenhagen-denmark/index.html
Tamara Hardingham-Gill,Mystery Hotel Budapest: The hotel designed for likes,"(CNN) — One of the first things you'll notice on entering the Mystery Hotel Budapest is the Aladdin-style magic carpet ""floating"" above the reception desk.

This is the first indication there's much more to this boutique hotel than meets the eye.

Then there's the countless light boxes on the walls displaying animated pictures that change several times a day and the elevator, which is partially hidden by velvet curtains.

Depending on which room you're staying in, you could find yourself lying against a headboard with a version of Johannes Vermeer's ""Girl with a Pearl Earring,"" where the ""girl"" has an iPhone in her hand, or a ""party girl"" interpretation of Da Vinci's ""Mona Lisa"" complete with VIP passes to Budapest's Sziget Festival.

And if you happen to book visit the ""secret"" Pythagoras meeting room, you'll have to figure out how to open it yourself (hint -- there's an unassuming box involved).

Located in Budapest's Terézváros district, the Mystery Hotel is arguably one of the most thrilling hotels in the city thanks to the intrigue that lies inside its walls.

It's set inside what was once the main headquarters of the Symbolic Grand Lodge of Hungarian Freemasons, providing the inspiration for its enigmatic theme, along with movies such as ""The Da Vinci Code.""

While it lacks the dramatic city views and central location of some of Budapest more famous hotels, the property, which opened in May 2019, is fast becoming one of the most Instagram-friendly places to stay in Budapest.

This is certainly no accident. In fact, the hotel's designer Zoltán Varró admits he had ""likes"" in mind when conceptualizing the property.

""Instagram has really changed the hotel industry,"" Varró tells CNN Travel. ""Around 20 years ago, people wanted to go to big names because they felt safe with them.

""Now the most important thing is to stand out. Everyone is looking for something special. Social media is vital.

""When a guest sees something amazing and takes a picture, it can be shared with the rest of the world in seconds.""

Viktória Berényi, director of business development at the Mystery Hotel, says social media has helped to bring in a large number of bookings.

""First impressions are everything,"" says Berényi. ""There's a lot of competition in Budapest. We had some difficulties with the engagement of people at first.

""But we've had lots of guests who come here because they saw the pictures on Instagram.""

One of the many intriguing areas of the hotel is the Great Hall, which serves as a dining area, a bar, as well as a lobby.

Varró decided to make it the building's main focus after seeing photographs displaying the significance of the room during the 1890s, when Hungarian Freemasons regularly congregated here.

Freemasonry past

One of the most influential and well-known secret societies, Freemasonry was founded in the UK, but quickly spread to Europe and the rest of the world.

The secular movement models itself upon the fraternities of medieval stonemasons, who used secret words and symbols to recognize each others' legitimacy.

After the former Republic of Councils in Hungary and later the Interior Minister of Hungary, Mihály Dömötör, banned the activities of Freemasons in 1920, the building went on to serve as a military hospital.

It was also used by the Hungarian National Guard Association, before returning to Freemasonry use after World War II. But during the communism era it went on to house the Ministry of the Interior until the fall of the regime in 1989.

Needless to say, the building changed considerably during its many different incarnations and its Freemasonry elements were concealed.

""After communism, the room was destroyed,"" says Varró. ""The Freemason aspects were completely covered, as no one wanted to talk about this.

""I didn't want it [the Great Hall] to be hidden away. This is the heart of the building.""

Its vaulted ceiling, which has been completely restored, is decorated with beautiful motifs, while the walls are adorned with bright columns and light boxes.

Although the entire hotel is filled with chandeliers, the largest hangs directly over a marble chess board floor area in the Great Hall.

At the far end of the room, two iron spiral stairs lead up to the gallery, where a private dining area aimed at larger groups can be found.

Lit up by candles, the grand staircase is one of various elements preserved from the original building, which dates back to 1896, along with the main doors.

You can see elements of the facade of the old building and the new building alongside each other from the sixth floor.

Varró has preserved various motifs used in Masonic symbolism around the buildings, along with sculptures of a sphinx, a square and compass.

Even the paintings in the corridors are linked to Freemasonry, some are the work of Freemasons background, while others are by artists from countries with strong links to the secular movement.

However, Berényi stresses the Mystery Hotel represents far more than just Freemasonry, noting the organization, which has been blighted by conspiracy theories, may hold negative connotations for some.

""As much as we are proud of the history, we can't make everything about the Freemasons, as they represent different things to different people,"" she says.

Unique suites

There are three different suite styles, Doric, Ion and Corinthian. The Doric rooms, which overlook the hotel's courtyard and the Secret Garden Spa, hold English Victorian style features and are decorated in various shades of green.

The Ion rooms are based on the upper floors of the hotel and possess a French mansard style, while the Corinthian rooms hold Baroque style furnishings, such as burgundy velvet curtains.

Located on the sixth floor, the Atelier Suite is the most unique suite in the building. Designed to resemble a painter's studio, it holds a marble staircase, brick walls, huge paintings and dozens of rugs. Even the TV stand takes the form of an art easel.

""The original plan was to have this room as a storage area, because it only has two small windows,"" explains Varró.

""When I decided to make it one of the biggest suites, the owner thought I was crazy. But it's been very popular.""

The suite is often requested for private gatherings, with the likes of Italian luxury fashion house Dolce&Gabbana hiring it for private events.

Impressive spa

While the Great Hall is a tough act to follow, not to mention rooftop bar the Sky Garden, which provides views of the Royal Palace, the hotel spa is another stand out spot.

There are plenty of beautiful thermal baths to choose from in Budapest, which means any hotel spa here has to be pretty impressive in order to entice visitors.

However, the Secret Garden Day Spa definitely doesn't disappoint.

Situated in the hotel's enclosed courtyard, it has a Baroque garden feel, with dramatic palm trees and a beautiful fountain.

Guests have the option to relax on day beds, slip into the sauna and steam room, or opt for some of the many cosmetic, body treatments and massages on offer.

The lighting in the spa is also fantastic due to its courtyard position, along with an array of crystal chandeliers.

""This was an empty place,"" says Varró. ""I wanted to create something different. I think this [the courtyard] is the perfect place for a spa. Budapest is not a very sunny city, but it's always summer here.""

Its center piece is undoubtedly the magnificent whirlpool, which provides a fantastic view of the facade of the building.

Tamara Hardingham-Gill,How Budapest became a fine dining force to be reckoned with,"(CNN) — While Budapest may be primarily known for its architecture, geothermal springs and communist heritage, the city's gastronomy scene has been gaining considerable travel attention in recent years.

New and exciting fine dining spots are constantly opening up in the Hungarian capital, many headed up by prolific chefs keen to inject imagination and prestige into the Budapest dining experience.

Two restaurants in the Hungarian capital were awarded new Michelin stars in the past 12 months alone, bringing the total of Michelin-awarded establishments in Budapest to six.

Hungary only received its first Michelin star nine years ago, so this is a pretty remarkable turnaround.

There's little doubt a culinary revolution is underway in the ""Pearl of the Danube,"" but what's brought about this burgeoning movement?

Record numbers of tourists and a booming economy have definitely played a part.

With Hungary's difficult past well documented, it's fair to say that fine dining hasn't necessarily been a high priority for locals haunted by Communist austerity.

""Hungary was always a pretty poor country,"" explains Hungarian food critic Andras Jokuti. ""So the main goal of Hungarian cuisine was to stay alive. It was very important to have lots of proteins and carbs -- it was based around potato and meat.""

Culinary movement

Miguel Vieira at Budapest restaurant Costes tells CNN Travel what makes great, creative cuisine.

Shifting this perception has been a lengthy process, which continues today. However, the tide is definitely turning.

Portuguese chef Miguel Rocha Vieira believes this is partly due to good quality produce becoming more readily available in the country during the past decade.

""We'd have to buy butter from abroad [before] because there was no good quality butter here,"" he tells CNN.

""Everything is completely different now.""

Vieira heads up Costes, based in Raday Street, and was at the restaurant's helm when it became the first in the country to earn a Michelin star back in 2010.

He produces modern takes on classic Hungarian dishes, serving up four to seven-course set menus with various wine pairings.

Jokuti feels that Vieira injected life into the dining scene by merging both Hungarian and Portuguese influences into his dishes early on.

""When Miguel arrived in Budapest, it was like the very beginning of the fine dining story in Hungary,"" he says.

Vieira admits he knew little about Hungarian cuisine when he came to the country all those years ago and was often ""hammered by critics.""

""My cooking has changed a lot,"" he adds. ""Now I can tell you proudly that my stamp is in the food.""

""One of the biggest compliments we can have here is if somebody says, 'I felt this dinner had personality.""

While Vieira tries to incorporate Hungarian traditions in his dishes, this isn't the ""ultimate goal"" and he certainly doesn't have Michelin stars in mind while in the kitchen.

""I always say to the boys, 'We should cook for ourselves. We should do what we believe.' It's not about cooking for awards,"" he adds. ""It's not looking for stars or for recognition.

""That's the cherry on top of the cake. But that's not why we work 14, 15 or 16 hours a day.""

Modern interpretations

Chef Tamas Szell from Budapest restaurant Stand on his modern interpretations of traditional Hungarian dishes.

Hungarian chef Tamas Szell has been credited with putting Hungarian food on the map back in 2016, when his modern interpretations of the country's traditional dishes won him the gold medal at the prestigious 'Bocuse D'or Europe' competition.

Szell and co-chef Szabina Szulló head up the kitchen at Stand, which was awarded its first Michelin star this March, has a similar approach to cooking to Vieira.

""Food is the best communication between a chef and the guests,"" Szell tells CNN.

""Hopefully our dishes contain the sweet memories from childhood. When I cook a dish, it should be acceptable to both our grandmothers and a Michelin inspector. This is the most difficult [part] I think.""

Stand opened in Budapest in 2018 following the success of market hall bistro Stand25, which Szell and Szulló also ran together.

""My inspirations definitely come from my childhood,"" he adds. ""My mother had a saying, 'we are poor but we are living well'.""

Szell says his fisherman's soup, which contains carp, paprika, water and tiny ravioli type pasta known as deraya in Hungary, is the second most popular soup after goulash.

""When I was a child, my mother often made it this way,"" he explains.

Szell's dishes appear to be having the desired impact. Stand, based on Székely Mihály street, has been a big hit since it launched.

In fact, Jokuti describes it as the ""the perfect Hungarian restaurant,"" praising the inventive way Szell manages to tone down the richness of traditional Hungarian cuisine.

""This, I think, is his biggest achievement. To somehow recreate the traditions into something modern,"" says Jokuti.

Szell sources his dairy products from a tiny farm just outside Budapest, which supplies to a handful of fine dining restaurants in the city.

Within 48 hours of the milk leaving the cow's udder, it's being served up back at Stand in the form of cottage cheese,

""I think the ingredients are the most important thing,"" adds Szell. ""The good ingredients always try to find the chef and the chef always tries to find the best ingredients.""

Find out why Budapest restaurant Babel is a unique feature of the city's culinary scene.

Situated in Budapest's downtown, Babel is one of the most recent restaurants in the city to be awarded a Michelin star.

It's relatively small, with around a dozen tables, exposed brick walls and dim lighting, offering an intimate dining experience.

Inspired by Hungarian traditions and the Romanian region of Transylvania, chef Istvan Veres presents five to 10 course tasting menus containing simple ingredients such as nettle or lichen.

Veres says cooking is an ""obsession"" rather than a passion for him, describing how he'll often dream about a dish and then attempt to bring it to life the very next day.

""In fine dining, you have to do something special, something unique,"" he says.""You put your soul on the plate.""

""I'm never scared about new things.""

According to Jokuti, it's this fearlessness that makes Veres such a trailblazing chef.

""Istvan's taste is not that easy to follow,"" says Jokuti. ""I love to go to Babel because I'm always surprised.""

Basic ingredients

Hoping to repeat the success of Stand, Babel and Costes, is new dining establishment Salt, which has only been open since October.

It's run by chef Szilard Toth and manager Mate Boldizsar, who often serve up the dishes to diners themselves.

Toth regularly goes foraging for produce in the Hungarian countryside, coming back with all types of edible delights.

""We find so many basic ingredients that an average chef does not really see very often,"" Toth tells CNN.

""This means we can introduce a world of flavors for our food -- amazing flavor pairings that can't be found anywhere else.""

The chef's table is positioned in the middle of the restaurant, so diners can wander over to ask questions about the dishes, or just watch Toth and his team in action.

Dishes are presented simply -- some don't even require cutlery -- and customers can opt for a Hungarian wine pairing menu to complement their meal.

The team at Salt pride themselves on transforming basic produce into fine dining and the restaurant is filled with jars containing fermented or pickled items found in the forest.

""We have a course called greasy bread,"" says Boldizsar. "" In its original form, it's a very, very simple dish.

""Just a piece of bread with some fat. We put some bacon on it, some caviar and some lambskin.""

Only time will tell whether Salt will gain a coveted Michelin star, but the restaurant does seem to be winning over may diners in the short time it's been around for.

""I think he [Toth] shows that it's possible to create a very hedonistic, but still very modern meal from sometimes humble, but very Hungarian ingredients,"" says Jokuti.

A restaurant like Salt would have seemed inconceivable in the Hungarian capital a few years ago.

Its emergence is a clear indication of the adventurous direction the city's culinary scene is currently moving in.

""It's really fascinating to witness these times in Hungarian cuisine,"" says Jokuti.

""I'm traveling a lot, visiting the world's best restaurants. It's amazing to see that I can come home and eat at these fine restaurants.

""It's not like, 'Okay, it's not so good, but it's at least it's Hungarian.'",2020-07-12,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/fine-dining-budapest/index.html
Kamilla Rzayeva,Azerbaijan's secret to long life? Mountain air,"(CNN) — There are a number of destinations around the world famed for the longevity of their residents.

There's one long-lived corner of the globe you won't have heard talked about as much, and it's home to the world's only Museum of Longevity. That's Lerik in southern Azerbaijan

The South Caucasus country is home to several regions known for producing residents who live to triple-figure ages, including Lankaran and Nagorno-Karabakh. But another, Lerik, is reputed to have the highest concentration of centenarians.

In this emerald land high above the clouds in the Talysh Mountains, reached by loop after loop of a serpentine road, people seem to have discovered a secret to a long and healthy life.

The Museum of Longevity

The two-room Museum of Longevity, built in 1991 and renovated in 2010, holds more than 2,000 exhibits documenting the lives and memories of the region's oldest inhabitants.

It charts individual lifespans with the household items that they've outlived, such as three generations of clothing irons. There are chests filled with headscarves and shirts, silver pitchers and bowls, beautifully knitted socks, and hand-dyed rugs that are still brightly colored despite their age.

And then there are the letters, written in both Azerbaijani and Russian -- personal artifacts so old that the ink is starting is fade.

Perhaps the most captivating features are the portraits of centenarians that cover the museum's walls. These images, dating from the 1930s, were donated by French photographer Frederic Lachop.

The museum, and official Azerbaijan statistics, define ""centenarian"" more loosely than you'd expect: Here, it means anyone over 90 years old.

However, back in 1991, there were more than 200 people in Lerik registered as being more than 100 years old, out of a population of 63,000.

Numbers have been less impressive since then, which locals blame variously on radiation from communication towers and environmental decline, but could just as easily be down to more rigorous record-keeping.

Today, there are 11 people more than 100 years old, out of a local population of 83,800.

The tale of the 168-year-old man

Is this the world's oldest man ever? Perhaps not. Kamilla Rzayeva

Lerik's current oldest citizen is Raji Ibrahimova, at 105 years. That's a fine vintage, but it pales in comparison to the age reputedly reached by area's most celebrated centenarian, Shirali Muslumov, a shepherd who supposedly lived to be 168.

The yellow pages of his passport claim that he was born in 1805 and his gravestone states that he died in 1973. If true, it would make the the oldest person to have ever lived.

Unfortunately, back in the early 19th century, birth registrations rarely took place in such remote villages as his birthplace of Barzavu, so there is no certifable record of when he was born.

Countless letters sent from all over the world on his various birthdays leave no doubt that he was indeed of a very respectable age, but it's perhaps best to factor in a minimum 20-year margin of error.

Among those corresponding with Muslumov were Vietnamese communist leader Ho Chi Minh, who sent a postcard greeting him with the endearment, ""Dear Grandpa.""

This longevity gene seems to run in the family. His 95-year-old daughter, Halima Qambarova, tells CNN Travel that -- while she might not live to 168, like her father -- she at least hopes to live to the age of 150, like her grandfather, or 130, like her aunt.

'Stillness of the mind'

When the weather turns cold, most centenarians relocate to the kinder coastal climes of Lankaran , but Qambarova was still in the Lerik village of Barzavu when CNN Travel dropped by her father's modest two-story home, surrounded by massive apple and pear trees (probably contemporaries of her famous father).

Sitting by the window, wrapped in a shawl, she speaks with a slight accent, switching often to her native language of Talysh, a dialect spoken by just 200,000 people and classified as ""vulnerable"" by UNESCO.

She shows off her passport, which doesn't list a month or date of birth, only the year: 1924. She may be 95, but she is fully present, interacting with her great-grandchildren, and demonstrating her lively sense of humor. When asked her age, she cheerfully replies, ""15.""

""Stillness of the mind is part of their secret,"" the museum guide says. ""They stay away from stress, thinking about life quite philosophically, living one day at a time, without much planning or worry for the future.""

Good nutrition and natural remedies

Halima Qanbarova is a young thing of 95. Her grandfather is said to have lived to 150, her father to 168, and her aunt to 130. Kamilla Rzayeva

Qambarova's day starts at dawn; she doesn't let herself sleep in. ""I get up as soon as my eyes open,"" she says.

She spends the whole day working in the garden or around the house. Her room is small, with a thick soft carpet and pillows on the floor. Many people here prefer sleeping on the ground, with just a thin blanket instead of a mattress, as it's believed to be the healthiest way to rest the back.

Contrary to popular belief, the centenarians of Lerik do eat meat, but they inherited a preference for fresh dairy products such as shor (cottage cheese), butter, milk and the yoghurt drink ayran from earlier centenarians, for whom the abstinence from meat was more due to economic circumstance.

Qambarova's daughter-in-law brings in a big plate with pears and apples from their garden and some aromatic tea.

It's herbal, floral and refreshing. Back at the museum, the guide shows a table with the various herbs native to Lerik.

""The secret of long life is good nutrition, the minerals in the spring water and the herbs that we add to tea to prevent illnesses, so people don't have to take any medicine, only using the natural remedies,"" says the guide. Indeed, Qambarova insists she's never taken any medication.

Generations living side by side

Beyond her windows, it may seem that the village is quiet and still. But the physical work that villagers put in every day is immense. From sunrise until sunset they work in gardens and fields as well as around the house. They sew and knit and take care of big families.

Such was the lifestyle of Mammadkhan Abbasov, a 103-year-old from Jangamiran village. Sitting on the carpet, across from the window, the centenarian has almost completely lost his sight and can barely hear his son telling him that guests have arrived, but when he finally catches it, he starts singing, offering prayers and good wishes.

At Abbasov's side is his great grandson -- a century gap between them.

Just like Qambarova, Abbasov has been a busy villager his whole life, working in the fields until about seven years ago, when his vision deteriorated.

'Whatever God gives'

Lerik is testament to the benefits of fresh mountain air. Kamilla Rzayeva

""He has always been a good man and lived his life properly,"" his son says.

In terms of food, he eats ""whatever God gives"" with just one restriction -- he never drinks alcohol.

Abbasov attributes his long life to daily physical activity, not to the point of exhaustion, but enough to challenge the body.

Along with the good nutrition from the farm products, he also used to drink liters of ice-cold spring water, which is rich with minerals said to contribute to longevity.

The headache-inducing altitudes of mountains may also be a factor.

2017 study by the University of Navarra, Spain , found that living at high elevation decreases the risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes. A 2011 study by the University of Colorado Denver found that these sky-high residents also live longer

The ages of some of these celebrated centenarians may still be disputed, but here in Lerik their legacy lives on through the people that still abide by the simple secret of Lerik's longevity: physical activity, good nutrition, lots of water and an attitude to life that says: We only live once, but if we do it right, once is enough.",2020-07-12,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/long-life-lerik-azerbaijan-wellness/index.html
Stella Chan,"Instagram star flaunted lavish lifestyle but was actually conspiring to launder hundreds of millions of dollars, US prosecutors say","(CNN) A Nigerian man nicknamed ""Ray Hushpuppi"" who flaunted his Rolls Royces, fancy watches and designer clothing on Instagram faces money laundering conspiracy charges in the United States, according to the Department of Justice.

Ramon Olorunwa Abbas appeared in a federal court in Chicago on Friday. He is accused of conspiring to launder hundreds of millions of dollars through cybercrime schemes.

According to a federal affidavit, one of the alleged victims was the client of a New York-based law firm that lost nearly a million dollars in 2019.

Abbas was arrested last month by law enforcement officials in the United Arab Emirates and transferred to the US this week by the FBI.

Prosecutors allege Abbas is one of the leaders of a global network that uses computer intrusions, business email compromise (BEC) schemes and money laundering capers to steal hundreds of millions of dollars.

Nyasha Chingono,"Shooting of Zimbabwe workers by Chinese mine owner shows 'systemic' abuse, watchdog says","Harare, Zimbabwe (CNN) The shooting of two Zimbabwean workers by a Chinese boss shows the ""systematic and widespread"" abuse that locals face in Chinese mining operations, says the Zimbabwe Environmental Law Society (ZELA).

In a court affidavit, police said Zhang Xuen shot an employee five times and wounded another at the mine he runs in Gweru province, in central Zimbabwe, during a row with workers over outstanding pay.

Zhang has been charged with attempted murder, said Zimbabwe police spokesman Paul Nyathi.

According to local media reports , Zhang did not enter a plea because there was no approved interpreter in court. He will remain in custody until at least July 7, the report said.

The shooting happened on Sunday morning, when miner Kenneth Tachiona confronted Zhang after he allegedly refused to pay his wages in US dollars, as agreed, according to the affidavit.

Tachiona charged toward Zhang, who then drew his gun, shooting the worker three times on his right thigh and twice on the left, according to the affidavit.

Police said Zhang fired another shot at workers, and one of the bullets grazed the chin of a member of staff. The wounded workers are being treated at a private hospital.

A video that many alleged to be of the incident has circulated on social media in Zimbabwe, provoking public anger and calls from a local watchdog for a re-evaluation of Chinese mining operations in the country.

Remarks by the Spokesperson of the Chinese Embassy in Zimbabwe pic.twitter.com/cRk0Jc2J46 — Chinese Embassy in Zimbabwe (@ChineseZimbabwe) June 22, 2020

The Chinese Embassy in Zimbabwe described the shooting as an isolated incident and said it was in support of an open and transparent probe by local authorities.

""Any possible illegal acts and persons who violate the law should not be shielded. China and Zimbabwe have a long-standing friendship and cooperation. We call upon all relevant sides to safeguard it jealousy and carefully,"" the Chinese Embassy said in a statement on Twitter.

The Chinese Foreign Ministry told CNN: ""Overall, Chinese companies in Zimbabwe have operated their businesses in accordance with local laws and regulations, and made positive contributions to Zimbabwe's economic and social development.

""We respect Zimbabwe's handling of the case in accordance with law, but at the same time hope to see Zimbabwe protect the safety as well as legitimate rights and interests of Chinese nationals. There is traditional friendship between the two countries and we believe both sides will be able to properly handle this case.""

Dangerous conditions

China is Zimbabwe's largest foreign investor with significant interests in the country's extractive sector.

Last year, Chinese firm Tsignchan signed a $2 billion deal with the Zimbabwean Ministry of Mines to extract chrome, iron ore, nickel and coal, vital resources for China.

At least 10,000 Chinese people are in Zimbabwe, and many are working on in the country's mining, telecoms, and construction sectors on a contractual basis, according to a 2016 Brookings Institution report

But their presence in the country has sometimes been controversial.

Both Chinese-run mines in the country and state mining operations have been dogged with allegations of human rights violations and poor safety measures for staff.

In February, a group of local miners in Matabeleland South province petitioned a labor court to protest their firing by their Chinese employer.

Last April, workers at another Chinese mining operation in the province complained of being underpaid and working without protective clothing.

Several cases of Chinese miners refusing to pay salaries or provide their workers with protective clothing, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic, are currently being investigated by ZELA, according to its deputy director Shamiso Mutisi

""It has become a pattern and a system. We have cases where miners are abused, beaten, and discriminated against by Chinese miners,"" Mutisi said.

In a statement on Wednesday, ZELA said locals in some Chinese-owned mines often operate ""dangerous, harsh, and life-threatening"" conditions, while being paid poorly for their time.

Sunday's shooting is another reason for the government to rethink its political and economic engagements with China, the group said.

""In many parts of Africa, including Zimbabwe, Chinese mining investors have exhibited a history of bad safety, health, environmental, labor, and human rights standards,"" the statement said.

CNN has contacted China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs for comment.

The Chinese community in Gweru has distanced itself from the recent incident and promised to pay for injured workers' medical bills and support their families as they deal with the issue.

The Chinese community said in a statement the incident does not reflect the behavior of its members, and they have engaged the company to compensate the workers.

""We sincerely hope that our friendship and cooperation between the two countries and two peoples will not be sullied by this isolated incident, which does not reflect the behavior of us all as the Chinese community,"" the statement read.",2020-06-27,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/27/africa/zimbabwe-mine-shooting-intl/index.html
Bukola Adebayo,She's on the frontline of a rape epidemic. The pandemic has made her work more dangerous,"CNN is committed to covering gender inequality wherever it occurs in the world. This story is part of As Equals, an ongoing series.

Lagos, Nigeria -- At the start of each day, Dr. Anita Kemi DaSilva-Ibru and her team put on gloves, facemasks and other personal protective equipment to see their patients.

They're not treating people for Covid-19, but they are on the frontline of the pandemic, working at the Women at Risk International Foundation (WARIF), a rape crisis center in Lagos, Nigeria.

Wearing protective gear is the new reality for crisis center workers, like DaSilva-Ibru.

""We change these kits each time we see a survivor as we are mindful of the risk of transmission of the virus between the survivor and us and the cross-contamination between a survivor and the next,"" she told CNN.

US-trained gynecologist DaSilva-Ibru has spent most of her career treating hundreds of sexual violence victims but it was the growing scale of the crisis in Nigeria that prompted her to set up WARIF in 2016.

The clinic in Yaba, a suburb of Lagos, provides medical treatment, legal assistance therapy and space for rape victims and survivors of sexual abuse to get back on their feet.

One in four Nigerian girls has been the victim of sexual violence, according to UN estimates but DaSilva-Ibru says the numbers are higher as many cases go unreported due to the stigma attached.

In recent weeks, two high profile cases of gender-based violence have brought Nigerian women out onto the streets demanding change.

Uwaila Vera Omozuwa, a 22-year-old microbiology student, was found half-naked in a pool of blood in a local church where she had gone to study after the Covid-19 lockdown left universities across the country shut.

""Rape is an epidemic in this country."" Dr. Anita Kemi DaSilva-Ibru, Women at Risk International Foundation

Her family said her attackers raped her and the student died while being treated at the hospital. A few days later, another student, Barakat Bello, was allegedly raped and killed during a robbery at her home, according to human rights group Amnesty International.

""Rape is an epidemic in this country,"" DaSilva-Ibru told CNN.

She says her work with survivors of sexual violence has become more critical during the outbreak, with restrictions to curb the virus from spreading fueling a surge in calls.

It's a story echoed in other parts of the region, as authorities grapple with a growing number of Covid-19 cases and the impact restrictions are having on women.

DaSilva-Ibru said she initially closed the center after authorities locked down the city in March, she had to reconsider the decision as the organization became inundated with SOS messages from sexual violence victims and their guardians.

Staff operating the 24-hour helpline at the center also reported a 64% increase in calls during this period, according to DaSilva-Ibru.

""Our phones were ringing. Women were calling and desperately asking how we can help them, these were women in fear of their lives, as many have now been forced into quarantine with their abusers, in an already volatile environment,"" DaSilva-Ibru told CNN.

For the center to re-open, DaSilva-Ibru said she had to source PPE, face masks and other protective gear personally and when that was not enough, the center launched an online appeal for funds from donors to buy the equipment at no cost to survivors, she said.

""We carry out forensic examinations on survivors and our frontline health workers who triage and examine patients are in close proximity to the survivors. As much as we need to carry out our duties, we also need to ensure our workers are adequately protected,"" DaSilva-Ibru told CNN.

The challenges Ibru faces to keep the center open, doesn't compare to what sexual violence victims have experienced as a result of this pandemic, she said.

DaSilva-Ibru recalls a woman who told staff at the center that her male friend had raped her in her home during the lockdown.

Dr. Anita Kemi DaSilva-Ibru.

""The first day we re-opened, we attended to women who had walked many miles in spite of the mandatory lockdown to get to the center. These are women who had been terrorized in their homes,"" she added.

""She (a survivor) had repeatedly been calling (the center) to find out how she could get help. She feared she might have contracted HIV and wanted to be tested,"" Ibru said.

Speaking to CNN, the woman, who didn't want to use her name to protect her identity, said a co-worker raped her after he came to her apartment unannounced in April.

The young banker said she had previously rebuffed his attempts to visit, but on that Sunday afternoon in April, he showed up at her doorstep.

""He's a friend, not a stranger, so I opened the door for him. I was still asking him what was so urgent that made him leave his home. He said he wanted to check up on me and I told him he could have done that over the phone,"" she told CNN.

But a few minutes into his visit, the conversation became uncomfortable between them.

""He kept coming towards me, and when I told him to stop, he put his hand over my mouth and pinned me on the floor,"" she said.

She says he apologized after raping her and hurriedly left her house.

The survivor told CNN she did not make a police complaint because she was worried about the stigma and strain that the rape might have on her parents.

A friend she confided in told her to reach out to the Lagos Domestic and Sexual Violence Response Team who put survivors in touch with treatment centers for help.

After several calls to the centers on their website, she was referred to WARIF

When she went to the clinic, she says staff ran some tests and placed her on Post Exposure Prophylaxis, a HIV prevention treatment for possible exposure.

""Sometimes I get really angry, and sometimes I feel numb,"" she said, reflecting on the assault.

She says she was sick every night for 28 days because of the drugs.

""...even though the doctor prepared me for the side effect, it has not been easy,"" she told CNN.

Gender-based violence is a problem in many countries, but the coronavirus pandemic has worsened the situation.

The UN says the raft of measures deployed by governments to fight the pandemic have led to economic hardship, stress, and fear -- conditions that lead to violence against women and girls.

Equality Now Regional Coordinator in Africa Judy Gitau told CNN that the wave of unemployment and school closures has put victims in a precarious situation.

The government enforced strict stay-at-home orders that closed businesses and schools across the West African nation to curb the spread of the virus, she said.

The restrictions made schoolgirls vulnerable to abuse as some were assaulted in their homes by relatives, and at the same time, a majority of girls from low-income families were coerced to exchange sex for money for food, Gitau said.

""Many of them wound up pregnant but the evidence became available when people were plugging back to life as they knew it as a normal society,"" she said.

Gitau says authorities must know that perpetrators often take advantage of the strict measures to abuse victims without arousing much suspicion.

As state resources are being re-focused to tackle the spread of coronavirus, law enforcement agencies should also respond quickly to reports of abuse and create shelters for victims in need of immediate rescue, she said.

But placing women in shelters, especially in countries battling an outbreak, comes with the additional burden of proof, according to DaSilva-Ibru who said shelters in Lagos city are asking survivors to take coronavirus tests before they can be admitted to prevent infection in their facilities.

""Violence against women and girls is one of the most pervasive forms of a human rights violation and should be recognized by all countries."" Dr. Anita Kemi DaSilva-Ibru, Women at Risk International Foundation

Authorities in Lagos designated gender-based violence services essential in May as it eased lockdown into curfews to allow service providers to get to work more smoothly, DaSilva-Ibru said.

The police force says it has now deployed more officers to its stations across the country to respond to the ""increasing challenges of sexual assaults and domestic/gender-based violence linked with the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic."" And last week, governors across the country resolved to declare a state of emergency on rape , according to the Nigerian Governor's Forum (NGF).

It's the first time federal and state authorities are coming out with a united voice to condemn gender violence, DaSilva-Ibru said and it validates the outcry of women in the country and the scale of the problem in Nigeria, she added.

""Violence against women and girls is one of the most pervasive forms of a human rights violation and should be recognized by all countries,"" DaSilva-Ibru said.

""In Nigeria, it has become a national crisis that needs urgent attention. I am pleased that this has been recognized.""",2020-06-23,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/23/africa/asequals-nigeria-rape-sexual-violence-intl/index.html
Kieron Monks,Nigeria challenges Christie's over 'looted' treasures,"Written by Kieron Monks, CNN

Nigerian historians and government officials are trying to stop the auction of several artifacts from the country.

The artifacts featured in auction house Christie's collection "" Arts of Africa, Oceania and North America "" are scheduled to go under the hammer in Paris Monday, with the most valuable expected to raise up to $1 million.

Critics claim the collection includes artworks that were looted during Nigeria's civil war, as well as other pieces that were taken earlier under British colonial rule.

Christie's deny that any items in the sale were acquired illegitimately.

Divine sculptures

Controversy has centered around Lot 47 -- a pair of sculptures representing Alusi, deities of the Igbo people, one of the three largest ethnic groups in Nigeria.

The sculptures are expected to raise more than $280,000.

The auction house lists the provenance of the sculptures as the collection of Jacques Kerchache, a leading collector of African art, adviser to the late President of France Jacques Chirac, and an influential figure in the creation of the Quai Branly museum in Paris.

The pieces passed to another private collection after Kerchache's death in 2001.

But Igbo-Nigerian art historian Chika Okeke-Agulu of Princeton University alleges the pieces were looted during civil war between 1967-70 , when the majority-Igbo region of Biafra seceded from Nigeria, precipitating a bloody conflict with the national government in which an estimated one to three million people died.

""My mother still mourns the overnight disappearance of countless alusi from communal shrines in my hometown, Umuoji, in Anambra State,"" wrote Okeke-Agulu in an Instagram post on June 6, that concluded ""these artworks are stained with the blood of Biafra's children.""

According to Christie's, Kerchache would have received the pieces in either Cameroon or Paris via local dealers.

""It is our understanding Mr. Kerchache never went to Nigeria in 1968/69 which suggests local agents were involved in initial trading, likely to Cameroon before shipment to Europe,"" said a source inside Christie's with knowledge of the artifacts in question.

""We have not had provided any additional information or documentation from any parties that questions the legality or legitimacy of the sale of these objects.""

The Christie's source added that any evidence the artifacts were ""acquired improperly"" would be assessed.

Proof of origin

The Nigerian government is demanding proof of the sculptures' origins, and of several other pieces listed in the sale.

""Some of the items ought not to be auctioned,"" says Babatunde Adebiyi, legal adviser of the National Commission for Museums and Monuments (NCMM), a Nigerian government agency. ""We suspect that some were taken out of Nigeria against the UNESCO convention of 1954 on antiquities taken from conflicts.""

The NCMM sent a letter to Christie's on June 17, seen by CNN, asking the company to remove the sculptures and four other lots from the auction while the agency verifies their provenance.

The cited lots include a bronze plaque from the Kingdom of Benin that the NCMM says was among the Benin Bronzes looted by the British army in 1897. The provenance is listed as 20th century Austrian art collector Frederick Wolff-Knize.

Adebiyi says the NCMM did not receive a reply to their letter. A representative of Christie's Paris branch disputes this, claiming ""we received this correspondence and replied to try to address these concerns, and to assure that these objects are being lawfully sold.""

Mounting criticism

Professor Okeke-Agulu is dismissive of the auctioneer's claim that the sculptures were procured ethically.

""I wonder what (Christie's) so-called well-respected scholars, collectors and dealers showed them as proof that these objects were legally acquired from a war zone,"" he told CNN.

""They can twist themselves into all kinds of difficult positions to try to justify the simple fact that they are selling sacred objects that were expropriated from my homeland.""

Nigerian-American art historian Sylvester Okwunodu Ogbechie of the University of California Santa Barbara has also criticized the auction.

""Christie's is putting up for sale African artworks that are clearly major items in the restitution debate,"" he wrote in a blog post . ""These activities are clearly meant to undermine the ongoing discussions about returning such African artworks to their countries of origin.""

The issue has also attracted wider public interest with more than 2,000 people signing a petition titled ""Stop Christie's from selling STOLEN Igbo Sculptures. #BlackArtsMatter.""

Amicable resolution?

The status of artifacts from African countries in European museums and auction houses has been under renewed scrutiny in recent months, as some Black Lives Matter protesters have made restitution a priority issue.

Earlier this month, BLM activists attempted to seize an African artwork at the Quai Branly museum in Paris, arguing it should be returned to its country of origin. The protesters were stopped and arrested.

The Nigerian government favors a consensual approach over direct action or litigation, says Adebiyi, citing the Benin Dialogue Group - a forum between Nigerian stakeholders and US and European museums over the Benin Bronzes.

""We have tried mediation...we don't want to spoil anyone's business,"" he says. ""But we cannot allow Nigerian artifacts to be sold abroad as they mean so much to us.""

For its part, Christie's has indicated a willingness to discuss the wider issues.

""We acknowledge there are nuanced and complex debates around cultural property and history,"" the Christie's source said. ""We wish to work in partnership with all stakeholders and where there is an opportunity, work diligently to find the right solutions for works of art.""

As of now Monday's auction is scheduled to go ahead as planned.",2020-07-12,https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/christies-nigeria-artifacts/index.html
Nyasha Chingono,She didn't want her neighbors to go hungry during lockdown. Now she is feeding thousands daily,""" Covid Heroes and Newsmakers "" is a weekly social media series featuring live interviews with African heroes serving their communities and newsmakers driving strategy as the continent faces Covid-19. Watch every Wednesday on CNN Africa Instagram .

Harare (CNN) With her baby strapped on her back, Maud Mufambi clutches a plate as she waits patiently in line for some food.

The 30-year-old mother is among hundreds of people queuing for free food outside a home in Chitungwiza township on the outskirts of Harare in Zimbabwe.

A woman is busy dishing out portions of maize meal porridge and Mufambi and her two-year-old baby are among the grateful diners, who know that, at least for one night, their meal is guaranteed.

Before a friend told her about the kitchen, Mufambi told CNN that her family would oftentimes go to bed hungry.

""My son and I will never go to bed hungry again, this relief kitchen will sustain us as I try to make ends meet,"" Mufambi said with a smile.

Zimbabwe's hunger crisis

The kitchen is run by Samantha Murozoki who is ensuring that people in her community are getting fed in a country where hunger is rampant.

More than seven million people -- half of Zimbabwe's population -- were facing food shortages or hunger before the coronavirus outbreak in the country, according to the World Food Programme (WFP)

UN food agency WFP is appealing for $US19.5 million to fund its logistics and operational response to the Covid-19 outbreak in the southern African nation.

""WFP is currently scaling up its urban assistance program to deliver monthly cash transfers for food to more than half a million urban dwellers in Zimbabwe by the end of the year,"" WFP Communications Director Neville told CNN.

Minister of Labour and Social Welfare, Amon Murwira said the government had revived its social welfare program during the lockdown to cushion millions facing hunger.

""Everyone who lost income can go to social welfare and register for assistance. We have a budget for the next eight months to cater for one million people,"" Murwira told CNN.

In March, the Zimbabwean government imposed the first 21-day lockdown, followed by another two weeks as Covid-19 cases increased.

Zimbabwe has officially recorded just 391 cases of Covid-19 but a mass outbreak would devastate an already weakened health system.

Authorities extended the nationwide lockdown i ndefinitely in May partially opening the manufacturing and mining sectors.

But people like Mufambi, who ekes out a daily living selling imported secondhand clothes, say they're finding it difficult to eat during the lockdown.

She's one of more than 16 million people who are struggling to make ends meet, according to the WFP.

It's a tiny drop in the ocean but Murozoki's food kitchen is plugging the gap and giving hope to hungry families in the area.

Samantha Murozoki serves food to a young child.

A national heroine

What began as a desire to feed a neighbor who had gone to bed hungry at the start of the lockdown has grown into a community feeding scheme, that attracts more than two thousand people daily, according to Murozoki.

""Ever since the lockdown was introduced, a lot of folks have suffered... they are sitting indoors with no way to make money and to find for themselves. This is how my little unit came up,"" she told CNN.

""It was mainly to cater to people I grew up with. Things escalated and I ended up feeding people from all over.""

Children queue for food outside Murozoki's kitchen in Zimbabwe.

Initially, she funded the project out of her own pocket, but the community soon started to contribute to sustain the project -- and she traded some of her own items too.

""It took me less than two weeks to get to 867 people coming to eat... so I started to barter jeans, sneakers, jackets. Anything I wasn't using at the time to trade for maize, cooking oil, salt, labor, so we could get the ball rolling,"" Murozoki said.

The 35-year-old lawyer and mother of two, has since become a national heroine and says her life has changed.

""It's been a roller coaster,"" she says. ""I'm just happy. My son understands that mummy needs to feed people... My day starts at 4 am and ends at 7.30 pm when we served the last meal... It's a lot of work... ""

In May, Murozoki faced a setback after the Chitungwiza municipal police shut down her feeding kitchen over regulatory issues.

She has since resolved the licensing problems and is feeding even more people.

""Our register has about 4300 people that have had a meal once or twice for the past 33 days. We serve an ever-growing community. I am glad that the government has recognized us and the kitchen is likely to feed more people,"" Murozoki said.

'Worst day of my life'

As well as hunger issues, daily wage earners have also been feeling the full force of the law, following a government crackdown on illegal structures.

Bright Mutema, 34, was forced to watch his vending stall destroyed by Harare municipal police. Local authorities have targeted stalls and wooden cabins like Mutema's after the government gave orders for them to be destroyed during the Covid-19 lockdown.

""It is the worst day of my life. I thought I would have somewhere to start from after the lockdown but I'm grounded. I fear for my children. What kind of father will I be if I cannot provide,"" Mutema tells CNN.

""Many people, including myself are more afraid of hunger than the virus. Hunger is more lethal than this virus that we cannot see,"" he said.

Mavis Mapako, 42, a mother of five, shutdown her tuckshop when President Emmerson Mnangagwa declared a nationwide lockdown in May.

Mapako has now resorted to street hawking for a living.

She has endured running battles with police, ordering people to stay indoors.

""I don't have anywhere to sell my goods, vending was banned because of the pandemic. We are always harassed by soldiers and police. All I want is food for my family, I don't even know what to do,"" Mapako tells CNN.

Soaring poverty levels

The lockdown economic woes have also affected the private and public sectors.

Obert Masaraure, leader of the Zimbabwe Rural Teachers Association of Zimbabwe told CNN that government workers were barely surviving under the extended lockdown.

""The lockdown has affected teachers in a big way. Poverty levels have soared. The majority of our civil servants are earning US$30. They have been surviving on side hustles which are part of the informal economy which has been completely shutdown,"" Masaraure said.

""The lockdown has plunged the civil servants into abject poverty,"" he added.

Zimbabwe faces a long road to recovery, former finance minister Tendai Biti told CNN. He said the country would remain stuck in depression until the government addresses Mugabe-era political issues that have made the nation ineligible for international funding.

""The key precondition here is to resolve the political crisis but it doesn't appear that it will be resolved any time soon. So talking about the prospects of a rebound when it comes to Zimbabwe is basically far-fetched and daydreaming,"" Biti said.",2020-06-18,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/18/africa/zimbabwe-coronavirus-lockdown-intl/index.html
Jo Munnik,Cape Town unfiltered: These photographers are shedding new light on the city,"Cape Town, South Africa (CNN) — When you think of Cape Town, what do you imagine? Perhaps you picture Table Mountain, penguins on the sand, or the stunning beaches that surround this city.

Cape Town is often considered one of the most Instagrammable cities in the world. For the past seven years, it has been voted the top tourist city in the world by the Telegraph Travel Awards

But beyond the picture-perfect version of the city, a different, more complex reality exists -- set against the backdrop of the world's most unequal country

Here we meet two of the photographers working to revealing a deeper, grittier and less publicized side of the city through their images.

l e v a r t

Ismaiel Isaacs, the portrait photographer of the Cape Flats

Ismaiel Isaacs , 31, grew up in Manenberg, in the Cape Flats -- a flat, sandy urban sprawl on the outskirts of Cape Town's city center. Beginning in the early 1950s, under South Africa's apartheid government, people of color were forcibly relocated there earning it the reputation of "" apartheid's dumping ground .""

Today, it is home to over a million people , most of whom are of mixed heritage.

Even after 26 years of democracy, it remains a notorious part of Cape Town, socio-economically marginalized from the city center and surrounding suburbs.

As Isaacs tells CNN, living here is a struggle; on a daily basis, people face gang violence , poverty and the risk of death due to ongoing drug wars.

But it is also a place of great character, community and culture -- and that is where Isaacs draws his inspiration.

""I try and convey a message of the beauty that's in the struggle,"" Issacs says. ""[It's] not only the struggles that we go through that make us stronger people, but people that live here -- they are beautiful.""

His photographs focus mostly on portraits of people from these communities. He describes his aesthetic as raw, unfiltered and emotive.

""My story of Cape Town in my photography is the story of not just mountains and beaches, but there's also an unpolished side of Cape Town that has been forgotten about,"" he says. ""And I feel that there's a need for us to recognize it, because there's a lot happening here. And actually, in the Cape Flats, we need support.""

Isaacs also says that he uplifts people through taking their photos.

""I'm trying to take the negatives and bring it into a positive, because as soon as I pick up my camera and ask someone, 'Look, here, can I take a picture of you?' What are they going to do? They're going to smile,"" he says.

""For that moment, I'm making them smile and that's fulfilling enough for me.""

Barry Christianson, the documentary photographer

Barry Christianson , 38, grew up straddling two different worlds: during the week, he lived with his mom in the Cape Flats, while his weekends were spent with his dad in the middle-class suburbs of Cape Town.

""Cape Town is a fundamentally fractured city, as divided as it is beautiful,"" Christianson says. ""There are multiple cities existing side by side -- some for the haves and others for the have-nots.""

For as long as he can remember, social and geographic disparity have impacted the way he has viewed the city he calls home. After spending 16 years as a computer programmer, he felt compelled to turn his photography hobby into a full-time job.

""From colonialism through apartheid to democracy, people of color have been dispossessed of land, livelihood and freedom of movement,"" Christianson says.

""Having to navigate the two realities and all that came along with them made me acutely aware of spaces I inhabited,"" he explains. ""A lot of my photography deals with issues around space and how space is created, who's in the space, who creates it and what happens to the space when different people occupy it.""

He brought CNN along for a tour of locations he's captured that illustrate these themes -- like Saunders' Rocks, a former Whites-only beach. Today, Christianson believes it is one of the most racially integrated beaches in the city.

He took one of his favorite photos at this spot -- a Muslim woman wearing a burkini, something he says you might not see in other parts of the city.

A lot of his work also focuses on people who have faced more recent eviction, especially in areas of inner-city gentrification

""As developers buy and sell valuable properties in the city center, black and mixed-race South Africans who managed to stay in the inner city throughout the apartheid era are being evicted and forced into low-quality housing on the city's outskirts"", Christianson says

""[Cape Town is a] city that keeps moving people around , a very specific group of people around, who are never really allowed to stay in one place permanently,"" he added.

Michael Cross,Namibia's last wild horses face a perilous future,"(CNN) — It's still debated exactly how the Namibian desert became home to a herd of wild horses.

One theory is that diamond prospectors brought horses more than a century ago to since-abandoned mining fields. Another theory, says author and historian Manni Goldbeck, is that they arrived with South African soldiers, who in 1915 landed in Luderitz, a town to the south. Later the troops were bombed, Goldbeck says, scattering the horses into the Namib coastal desert, where they remained.

In any case, this has been their home for over a century, and what isn't up for debate is that they're desperately imperiled.

Their situation has prompted concern from the nearby community of Aus, a small town on the fringes of the Namib-Naukluft National Park to the north and Tsau //Khaeb National Park to the south. The horses are the lifeblood of the economy, drawing tourists who come to see them living amid inhospitable sand dunes and the barren plains of Garub.

""We've got about ... 800 local people, and of that 130 are actively involved in tourism,"" hotel owner Bernd Roemer told CNN last year. ""If an attraction like the horses would fall away it will not kill tourism completely, but it will make a strong indent.""

""Really there (are) no work opportunities in Aus,"" added resident Tuuli Martin, ""the only work opportunities ... are lodges.""

Biologist Telane Greyling says the wild horse population has declined from 286 in 2012 to just 65 adults. The future of the herd rests on a few precious foals, yet only one, named Zohra, has survived to see its first birthday in the past seven years.

Problem predator

Historically, the horses have faced multiple battles. In the 1980s, new park boundaries cut off a portion of their roaming area. In the early 1990s, a prolonged drought killed some horses (an event which brought Greyling to Aus). For the past 20 years spotted hyenas have been a concern.

""In 2000 they took about two foals, then it was quiet,"" Greyling recalled. ""(In) 2003 they started coming in again and a little more often."" During 2012 there were 50 foals born, Greyling said, and by the end of 2012 the hyenas started attacking those foals. ""By the end of 2013 they were able to ambush and pull down an adult horse,"" she added.

Hyenas have been responsible for scores of horse deaths, but complicating matters, the problem predator is also in danger. ""In a lot of areas, like Namibia, they are vulnerable (to) extinction,"" said Karl Fester, a hyena researcher at Namibian conservation group N/a'an ku sê Foundation, who estimates hyena numbers in the country have dropped from 2,000-3,000 in 1998 to less than 1,000 in 2019.

The two species, one native, one not, have created a conservation conundrum. In early 2019 the Ministry of Environment and Tourism (MET) reported it had killed three hyenas thought to have preyed on foals, after attempts to relocate them had failed. The act proved controversial in the eyes of some conservationists.

In the middle of last year, the MET drew up a 2020-2029 management plan for Namib horses, which included supplemental feeding and water, and predator management. Hyenas would not be killed or captured but would be scared off to protect horses. The horses would not be moved, but in times of drought and severe predation they would be fenced off.

Drought has been the main concern for 2020's new foals, says Greyling.

During the Covid-19 pandemic tourist numbers have dwindled. ""The last few weeks (felt) like we have the place to ourselves again,"" says Christine Swiegers, secretary of the Namibia Wild Horse Foundation.

When visitors return, they will hopefully be able to see Zohra and this year's new foals -- six at the time of writing, according to Greyling. Buoying their prospects, the drought which had claimed other horses has now broken, with small tufts of grass growing on the plains.

A single good year does not erase long-term problems, however. ""Even without predation, it's the seven-year generation gap that is a threat to the future of the population,"" Greyling explains. ""It means that in 2026 there's going to be no mare that's in the age group 7-15 years, which is the main reproductive age of the population.""",2020-07-12,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/namibia-wild-horses-spc-intl/index.html
Aisha Salaudeen,How Flutterwave is helping SMEs in Africa 'keep the lights on' during the pandemic,"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) Before coronavirus pandemic, Rovingheights , a book distribution business based in two Nigerian cities made sales daily from online and walk-in orders.

The stores were also a hive for book lovers who attended reading events in Lagos, the country's bustling metropolis, and in Abuja, its capital.

But as the virus spread to the country, forcing a lockdown that lasted several weeks in some of its major cities in March, Rovingheights says it was forced to temporarily close down its stores and online operations.

The Roving Height bookstore is also used for small events like book readings

Adedotun Eyinade, co-founder of Roving Heights told CNN that sales dropped significantly during the lockdown, leaving the business with no choice but to cut down on employee salaries in April.

""We weren't making a lot of sales and the logistics of delivering books during the lockdown was difficult because book stores were not among the essential services allowed to operate,"" he said.

""April was difficult. It was like the poorest sales in about two years for us,"" he added.

In Nigeria, small and medium enterprises such as Rovingheights account for 96% of businesses and 84% of jobs, and for the last five years, they have contributed to around half of Nigeria's GDP , according to online publication, Stears Business.

Many sectors in the country such as aviation, leisure, and real estate have been impacted by the spread of coronavirus.

Airlines, for example, are shut down as all airports in the country have been closed to contain the virus.

A free online store for businesses

As businesses like Rovingheights continue to feel the impact of Covid-19, a Lagos and San Francisco-based tech company, Flutterwave , has built a digital store for business owners, allowing them to display and sell their products online.

The company's core business is digital payments and it joined forces last year with Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba's Alipay to offer digital payments between Africa and China.

Founder Olugbenga Agboola told CNN that Flutterwave store was created in response to the current pandemic which has infected more than 115,000 people on the continent as of May 27.

Agboola said the company noticed that many SMEs did not have an online presence which was a critical way of making sales in the wake of the pandemic.

""You have small companies trying to sell to their customers and can't earn due to Covid-19, they are all shut down. So, we thought, what can we do to help them keep the light on? How can we help them move their sales online and settle customers?

Then we came up with the Flutterwave store that allows any small business anywhere in the world to go online, create a profile, and upload their product online and start selling,"" he said.

They can also set prices and choose to integrate their own delivery system or use Flutterwave's delivery partners such as Sendbox in Nigeria and Sendy in Kenya.

""The SME owner has access to analytics on the platform. They can see who is paying them and from where, they can pay suppliers and staff from the platform. It's a one-stop-shop,"" Agboola explained.

Joining the Flutterwave store is free and businesses are only charged a small payment fee for their transactions, he said.

Using the Flutterwave store

More than 1,000 businesses from across Africa have so far signed up to sell their products using the store, according to Agboola.

One of them is Rovingheights . With the lockdown now lifted, the business has partially resumed operations and is in the process of trying to get back on track.

""When the storefront opened, I was like, this is exciting. I felt it was a good way to reach out to more people. So, it's just one of the things we did to get through to more customers,"" owner Eyinade said.

Joining Flutterwave store, despite their own existing online presence, has been a boost for the company, he added.

""One of the highlights of our month was just getting people telling us they saw our store on Flutterwave. We had a lot of feedback like that so that was useful for us,"" he said.

The store, which is open to any type of business on the continent will continue to run post coronavirus, according to Agboola.

""Our goal is to continue to help SMEs scale their products. We want to help them keep their lights on.""",2020-05-28,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/05/28/africa/flutterwave-coronavirus-africa/index.html
Stephanie Bailey,Mami Wata: The surf brand changing the perception of surfing in Africa,"Cape Town (CNN Business) When a South African surf company wanted to put African culture on the global surfing map, it knew it needed a distinct African symbol.

It chose the name Mami Wata or ""Mother Ocean,"" a mermaid-like spirit from West African folklore with long, flowing hair who, followers believe, can charm snakes.

The Cape Town brand designs and produces surf wear, surfboards and accessories. Launched in 2017, it aims to move perceptions of surf culture away from western stereotypes and towards ""the power of African surf.""

Surf company Mami Wata is aiming to represent the growing diversity of African surfing.

""Surfing's history has been told through the lens of Australian brands and American brands, which is largely a blond-haired, blue-eyed story, whereas actually there's a lot of people that story isn't relevant for,"" Mami Wata's co-founder Nick Dutton said.

The company is trying to change that by telling a different story.

Stephanie Bailey,This luxury ice cream is made from insects,"(CNN) After a long day under the beating South African sun, an ice cream might be a tempting treat.

But would you be able to enjoy it if you knew it was made from bug ""milk?""

Gourmet Grubb, a Cape Town-based start-up, is hoping to use ice cream to introduce the public to the world of eating insects.

Its luxury ice cream uses EntoMilk , a dairy alternative made by blending the larvae of a tropical insect known as the black solider fly.

The UN predicts that the world will need to double food production to feed the global population by 2050 and has long promoted insect farming as a sustainable alternative protein source to traditional livestock.

Everybody loves ice cream

""We set out to change the way insects were seen, produced and used in the food industry,"" said Leah Bessa, who co-founded Gourmet Grubb in 2017.

Although over 1,900 insect species are estimated to be consumed by humans worldwide, insects are yet to reach the mainstream of Western cuisine.

The insect ""milk"" ice cream is made with natural ingredients, such as raw honey, cocoa, spices and organic peanut butter.

""We were expecting a lot of push back, however people have been extremely open minded,"" Bessa told CNN. ""Everybody loves ice cream.""

The ice cream flavors include chocolate, peanut butter and Christmas spices. According to Bessa, EntoMilk has ""a slightly earthy undertone"" and gives the ice cream ""a rich, creamy taste.""

But it's not just about the taste -- Bessa says insect ice cream is also high in nutrients. According to Gourmet Grubb EntoMilk is five times higher in protein than dairy.

According to the UN, it is widely accepted that insects provide nutrients that are comparable to meat and fish.

""Insects are inherently high in fat and protein and minerals,"" said Bessa. ""The black solider fly has protein and fat content comparable to beef, and zinc, iron and calcium that are much higher than that of beef.""

EntoMilk is also lactose-free and gluten-free, and unlike dairy milk it does not contain any carbohydrates or sugars.

Environmentally friendly

""We decided to focus on an industry [food] that is under a lot of pressure due to animal welfare and environmental concerns,"" said Bessa. ""Insects aren't sentient beings, and they only grow in the conditions in which they thrive, so the farming conditions cater to their animal welfare needs.""

EntoMilk is a dairy alternative made from insects. It is full of nutrients and environmentally friendly to farm and produce.

According to Gourmet Grubb, liter for liter , EntoMilk is more water and energy efficient to produce than any dairy milk or dairy milk alternatives.

""Insects need very little water, feed and space to grow,"" Bessa explained. ""They also produce little/no greenhouse gases compared to traditional livestock.""

Because insects can be farmed indoors in small, controlled environments they can be reared in urban areas, reducing the impact of transporting the milk to the city. It also means they are less at risk of being impacted by external climate patterns, which would affect cattle and crops.

There is also potential for insect farming to reduce waste.

""Some insects, like the black solider fly larvae, have the ability to feed on a wide range of organic matter,"" said Bessa. ""For example, the spent grain left over from brewing beer is used to feed the larvae.""

The future of food?

Currently, Gourmet Grubb's ice cream is only distributed in South Africa, but the global edible insects market is predicted to reach $1.2 billion by 2023.

As well as ice cream, Gourmet Grubb helps develop savoury dishes. These are polenta fries made with mopani worm powder.

Last month, Gourmet Grubb also opened a concept popup store, which included savory insect dishes such as insect powder pasta, chickpea black-larvae croquettes and mopani worm hummus, to serve alongside its ice cream.

""We need to find alternatives that will be able to sustain the growing population and create a sustainable and environmentally friendly farming system,"" said Bessa.

""The only way EntoMilk can truly make a difference and reduce the pressures of traditional dairy is if it is accepted and consumed on a global scale.""",2019-07-25,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/07/25/business/gourmet-grubb-insect-ice-cream-intl/index.html
Angus Watson,Australian border community cleaved in two by coronavirus lockdown,"Albury, Australia (CNN) As Australia shuts the border between its two most populous states to contain the spread of the coronavirus, tens of thousands of people living close to the dividing line have found their community cleaved in two.

Located on each side of the Murray river that separates New South Wales (NSW) and Victoria, the twin cities of Albury and Wodonga, more commonly referred to as Albury-Wodonga, have long operated as one community and one economy.

Many of their 100,000 residents cross the border to travel to work and school everyday. Businesses run on both sides of the river. The two cities even share the same hospital, located in Albury on the NSW side but covered by Victoria's health system.

But that border was sealed on Wednesday, as authorities scrambled to prevent a second wave of infections spreading across the country. Over the past few weeks, Victoria has struggled to contain a sudden reemergence of coronavirus in Melbourne, as case numbers have continued to rise.

Authorities blocked major roads between Victoria and NSW after midnight -- the first time in 100 years since the border was last closed during the Spanish flu pandemic.

People from Victoria are banned from entering NSW, but exemptions are made for some purposes and professions, including cross-border residents in settlements like Albury-Wodonga.

Online applications for cross-border permits started on Tuesday night, but the website crashed just 45 minutes after launching as 44,000 people applied, according to Australian national broadcaster ABC.

There are 55 ground crossings between Victoria and NSW, on a border that stretches over 1,000 kilometers (621.3 miles). Albury-Wodonga lies on the busiest crossings of them all -- and on the biggest freight route in Australia, raising concerns about the potential economic damage to the region.

A sign of no entry is displayed in the New South Wales, Victoria border town of Albury on July 7.

""Complete frustration and chaos""

On early Wednesday morning, traffic stretched for miles at the border checkpoint on Lincoln Causeway, a major thoroughfare connecting Albury and Wodonga, as police officers scrutinized each car making the crossing.

It took some Wodonga residents -- from the Victoria side of the border -- 50 minutes to get through the checkpoint at 6 a.m. to go to work in Albury, said Wodonga Mayor Anna Speedie, who called the situation ""unacceptable.""

""Unfortunately today did start off as we expected with complete frustration and chaos,"" Speedie told reporters next to the checkpoint.

""By 7.30 a.m., we had a traffic banked out to the middle of my city, right to the heart of the city,"" she said.

Police stop and question drivers at a checkpoint on July 8 in Albury, Australia.

Speedies said her government would continue to work with the NSW police to put in place some more practical approaches.

""We have to do better, we absolutely need to find solutions because this is absolutely unattainable for our community.""

Albury Mayor Kevin Mack said three people from Melbourne had been caught trying to drive across the state border into Albury since 2 a.m., Wednesday. They were turned back by the police, he said.

This week, Albury recorded two new coronavirus cases for the first time in weeks. A resident returning from Melbourne contracted the virus and passed it to a family member, according to local health authorities.

Bikram Gujral, a truck driver waiting in line at the checkpoint, said he understood the strict border restrictions that have been put in place.

""Obviously it's frustrating for anyone. But whatever the government is doing is for the benefit of us anyway, so I feel like it's the right thing to do if it's in the favor of us being safe,"" he said.

Separated by the border

But for some, the border closure may cost them their last chance to see their loved one.

April Smithers, 29, is being treated for terminal bone cancer at the Albury Wodonga Regional Cancer Center in Albury, on the NSW side of the border.

She and her husband Chris Carter live in Wodonga, on the Victoria side.

""Our home is in Victoria. We cross into New South Wales almost every day to come to this hospital. With the border closure...I'm gonna stay here. Luckily the hospital gave me a bed last night,"" Carter said.

The reemergence of the virus points to the difficulties faced by authorities the world over, as they attempt to reopen cities following protracted lockdowns. Australia has been heralded as among the world's most successful countries in tackling and containing the virus, shutting down its border and restricting international travel early.

But weeks after states in Australia eased social-distancing restrictions, a fresh outbreak resurfaced in Melbourne last month. On Tuesday, Victoria State Premier Daniel Andrews announced Melbourne will return to a six-week lockdown starting from midnight Wednesday.

Residents in the second largest Australian city will no longer be allowed to leave their homes unless it's for grocery shopping, caregiving, exercise or work. Cafes and restaurants that were allowed to reopen weeks ago will return to take away and delivery only. Beauty and personal services will be closed, as well as cultural and entertainment venues.",2020-07-08,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/08/asia/australia-albury-wodonga-coronavirus-intl-hnk/index.html
Michelle Toh,Virgin Australia finds new owner in US private equity firm Bain Capital,"Hong Kong (CNN Business) Virgin Australia has found a new owner.

Administrators for the carrier announced Friday that it had selected Bain Capital, the US private equity firm, to take over the company, two months after its collapse . Terms of the deal were not disclosed.

Bain won out over Cyrus Capital Partners, a New York-based investment firm, which had also submitted a binding offer.

""Several proposals from other interested parties"" were also submitted this week, including a proposal by some of the airline's bondholders, according to the administrators.

Bain Capital says it wants to ""protect as many jobs as possible"" at Virgin Australia while supporting the airline's ""unique culture."" The airline employs about 10,000 people.",2020-06-25,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/25/business/virgin-australia-sale-bain-capital-intl-hnk/index.html
Michelle Toh,"Qantas is cutting 6,000 jobs and raising $1.3 billion to survive the pandemic","Hong Kong/Sydney (CNN Business) Qantas (QABSY) is cutting 6,000 jobs and looking to raise up to 1.9 billion Australian dollars ($1.3 billion) as the carrier fights to survive the coronavirus pandemic.

The cuts announced Thursday account for 20% of Qantas' total workforce of 29,000 people, according to the company. They will primarily affect the airline's corporate, ground and flight staff, while another 15,000 workers will remain on furlough ""until flying returns,"" it added. Jetstar, the company's budget carrier, will also be affected.

Boeing BA The airline is also making drastic changes to its fleet as part of a broader, three-year plan to help its business recover from the historic slump in global travel . Most of the carrier's international aircraft — or up to 100 planes — will stay grounded for a year, the company said. Its six747 jumbo jets are also being retired six months ahead of schedule.

The new measures are expected to help the company lower costs by 15 billion Australian dollars ($10 billion) over three years. After that, it's targeting 1 billion Australian dollars (roughly $686,000) in recurring savings each year.

Qantas shares, which have fallen 41% this year, were halted from trading in Sydney on Thursday as it made the announcement. Its fundraising plan will involve offering an additional 1.36 billion Australian dollars (about $933,000) worth of shares to institutional investors, at about a 13% discount to the stock's closing price Wednesday.",2020-06-25,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/25/business/qantas-airways-job-cuts-intl-hnk/index.html
Hilary Whiteman,"In this Australian hotel, refugee and asylum seeker guests are not allowed to leave","Brisbane, Australia (CNN) Every day, the men unfurl large pleas for help over the balcony railings of their hotel room and stand in silence as traffic roars along the main road of the Australian city they're trapped in.

Their signs are mostly made from bin bags stuck together with tape, and secured to the railing with shoelaces.

""Where is justice?"" one reads.

These men are not hotel guests, but refugees and asylum seekers who have been in Australian immigration custody for seven years. Many arrived in Australian waters in 2013, after the government introduced offshore immigration processing. They were detained on the remote islands of Manus in Papua New Guinea (PNG) and on Nauru in the Pacific, in conditions once described by the United Nations as "" harsh"" and ""inadequate ."" In 2016, Amnesty International called Nauru an ""open-air prison.""

All are suffering the effects of prolonged, indefinite detention and were brought to Australia last year for urgent medical treatment.

But some say the conditions in the Brisbane hotel are worse than PNG or Nauru.

""You're in prison in here. In PNG, you have a little bit of freedom. You can move around. There is no ABF (Australian Border Force), no security guards around you,"" said Farhad Rahmati, an Iranian refugee who was transferred to Australia from PNG last July.

For months, the 120 or so men inside the hotel kept quiet about their plight. However that changed in March, when the number of coronavirus cases in Brisbane started rising. Fearing the virus would enter the hotel via the guards who come and go, they crafted signs large enough to be seen from the street.

As people noticed their pleas, weekly demonstrations began outside the hotel. These demonstrations have now escalated into a blockade by human rights activists who are demanding the men be freed.

The standoff between cellphone-armed protesters and security guards has cast unwanted attention on an Australian immigration policy that has long been, by definition, focused offshore.

Now it's playing out in the heart of one of Australia's largest cities in a 4.5-star hotel that only a few months ago was still accepting paying guests.

Protesters staged weekly protests that escalated into an occupation when security guards tried to remove a detainee.

Offshore detention

In 2018, it was reported that Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison had a model migrant boat on his desk bearing the words: ""I stopped these.""

Before taking high office, Morrison helped strengthen the country's border protection policies, which mandate that people arriving by boat will be processed offshore -- and even if they are found to be refugees, they will never be settled in Australia.

The government says this policy removes demand for people smugglers and prevents deaths at sea. Boat arrivals peaked in 2012, when more than 17,000 passengers arrived from Iran, Afghanistan, Myanmar and other troubled nations, via hubs such as Indonesia and Malaysia.

Few boats arrive now, but human rights advocates say the policy has created a cohort of prisoners confined to islands offshore. As the detainees' mental health deteriorated, advocates pushed for a law to allow doctors to decide if they should be brought to Australia for medical treatment. The medevac bill was passed in March 2019, opening the door for transfers, but the government abruptly closed it again after winning an election that May, citing national security concerns.

Before that happened, almost 200 men had been brought to Australia under the medevac law, including some who were suicidal. Others had brain injuries, undiagnosed gastrointestinal bleeding, heart conditions and broken bones that needed surgery.

For months, many of those detainees lived in one of the Brisbane hotel's three buildings, confined to the upper floors -- and beyond the view of paying guests. Before the coronavirus outbreak, they were allowed visits from pre-approved guests. Now, they're only allowed out for medical appointments, escorted by guards.

In March, due to the pandemic, more space was needed for social distancing in Brisbane Immigration Transit Accommodation (BITA), the main immigration detention center on the city's outskirts. About 40 more detainees were moved to the hotel -- and their rooms opened onto a balcony with a view of the street.

Saif Ali Saif peers out from his hotel room balcony where he has hung images of his three-year-old son.

Watching the world go by

Somali father-of-one Saif Ali Saif stands on his balcony each day, with his own sign scribbled in pen on an old T-shirt. It says: ""I want (to) hug my son."" His wife Sabah Siyad lives in community detention 29 kilometers (18 miles away) with their three-year-old son, Sammi. She gets a small government allowance each week and is not allowed to work or study. The family hasn't held each other since March, when visits stopped due to the coronavirus.

Saif worries Sammi will forget him.

Saif Ali Saif was able to receive visits from Sabah Siyad and their son Sammi before the coronavirus pandemic.

Saif escaped war while working as a driver in Yemen; Siyad ran from bombing in Somalia. She lifts her sleeve to show shrapnel scars as proof. The refugees met and married in Nauru in 2016 and Sammi was born on Valentine's Day the following year. Their baby was a few months old when it became apparent that his breathing difficulties required specialist care. Officials approved the baby's transfer to Australia with his mother but not Saif. ""I was really scared my son would die there,"" he said, so he let them go.

Saif was told last June he was being transferred to Australia and has now spent a year in detention. He says he doesn't know why he was transferred.

The family has been separated for three years. ""Sammi wants his father,"" Siyad said.

Iranian refugee Farhad Rahmati was transferred to Australia for treatment for a heart condition.

From his balcony, Rahmati, the Iranian refugee, can see a pub, a car wash, restaurants and a McDonald's on the next block.

""I see everything, but I have no chance to touch it,"" he said. ""I see people walking their dogs. I love dogs. I'd love to have a chance to, you know, to walk my dogs. But look at my situation. I'm not even close to that.""

Rahmati worked as a civil engineer before fleeing Iran in 2013. He doesn't want to talk about why he left.

While Rahmati and Saif stand on the balcony with signs, many detainees don't. They stay in their rooms, worried that protesting will affect their chances of ever being freed.

A detainee holds a sign to the window of his Kangaroo Point hotel room: ""Thank you.""

Strange events on the corner

Even before the signs went up, neighbors noticed something strange going on at the hotel on the corner: cars with blackened windows, guards with earpieces, trucks coming and going on a regular basis. No one told them what was going on at the hotel, which has been there for over a decade.

Central Apartment Group (CAG) took over the hotel's operation in 2018 and changed its name to Kangaroo Point Central Hotel and Apartments. It's one of 18 hotels on the company's website, advertised as family-friendly accommodation ""ideal for business and leisure travellers.""

When contacted by CNN, the group's CEO Sid Knell said he would not comment about events at Kangaroo Point. ""You can ask me about self-drive holidays,"" he said.

Nearby residents, however, have railed against the appearance of a prison on their street.

""How could they start a prison and not tell people?"" asked Annette Hogan. The residents CNN spoke to said they didn't have a problem with the refugees, but the walls and guards had changed the tone of the neighborhood. Opinions differed on the local Facebook page: ""Send them back,"" one post said.

Hannah and Anand Parameswaran have a direct view of the hotel grounds for their kitchen window. From there, they can see the small pool where guests used to swim. The detainees aren't allowed to use it.

""I feel a little bit guilty coming and going,"" said Hannah Parameswaran. Anand agrees: ""I feel really guilty because it's our money being used to do this to them.""

Temporary fences have been erected around the hotel, but the neighbors can see into the hotel grounds from their kitchen.

The Refugee Council of Australia estimates it costs the government 346,000 Australian dollars ($236,000) each year to hold someone in detention in Australia. That is on top of the AU$7 billion ($4.8 billion) the government spent on offshore processing from 2012, according to the Australian National Audit Office

Carmelo Nucifora, who runs Spizzico, the Italian restaurant on the hotel premises, says he wasn't consulted about plans for a prison on the site. As more fences went up, blocking off most of the restaurant's parking area, he said he sought a meeting with Australian Border Force officials. ""I went and pleaded to one of the officers. It's embarrassing, but I cried in front of them, pleading for some attention, for mercy,"" he said.

Like other restaurants in the city, he was forced to limit his business to takeaway only during the coronavirus lockdown. Takings plunged from around AU$14,000 a week to AU$2,000.

Now, even as coronavirus restrictions ease to allow more diners, his restaurant is surrounded by protesters.

Protesters camped in tents outside the hotel until police cleared the sidewalk. Then they moved across the street.

The protests

""Seven years too long. Free the refugees,"" chant protesters through a tannoy outside the hotel. Last Thursday, their weekly protest turned into a 24-hour occupation when word spread that Border Force officials had arrived to transfer Rahmati, the Iranian refugee, to BITA.

Cellphone footage shot by another detainee, and seen by CNN, shows Rahmati being led to a van by security guards, where they are ambushed by protesters, who stand on the roof and glue their hands to the van. Rahmati is hurried back inside the hotel and returned to his room.

Protesters don't want any of the men to be transferred deeper into Australia's immigration detention system. They're demanding the men be released into the community by Christmas.

But on Friday morning, the guards came back for Rahmati.

An Emergency Response Team burst into his room, ordered him to lie face down on his bed, cuffed him, flipped him over and took him to a waiting car, Rahmati said via cellphone from the high-security compound in BITA, where he was taken. Rahmati is in Australia receiving treatment for a heart condition.

Matt Sheppard, from rights group Refugee Solidarity Meanjin, says too few protesters were positioned outside a gate to stop the car that took Rahmati away. After that, protesters blockaded the exits and agreed only to clear them if they were able to search vehicles coming and going, to make sure no more refugees would be transferred.

Sheppard says he believes Rahmati was taken from the hotel because he spoke to the media.

""He's just a really charismatic person that provides a lot of support for the men inside as well. So, I think it was a calculated move to remove him from the community and break up that cohesion,"" he said.

In a statement , Australian Border Force Commissioner Michael Outram denied detainees were being ""punished"" or moved for speaking to advocates or the media. ""Detainees are routinely moved for a range of reasons, including health, welfare or to ensure the safety of other detainees, staff and the public,"" he said.

The day after Rahmati's removal, hundreds gathered in the street to call for the occupants' release. Saif, the Somali refugee, spoke from the balcony, his phone call amplified on speakers to the crowd. ""Let me hug my son,"" he said.

One by one, the crowd started chanting, ""Let him hug his son, let him hug his son."" They cleared a path to the hotel entrance so Siyad could push Sammi towards him in his pram. She got as far as the gate before the request was denied.

They don't know when they'll next be able to meet.

A spokeswoman for acting Immigration Minister Alan Tudge told CNN that ""it was made very clear to those who were transferred under the medevac provisions that they would be placed into immigration detention.""

David Manne, the executive director of Refugee Legal, said the law also allows the minister to release them.

""There are powers at the disposal of the government and the minister personally to release these men from detention. It's incumbent upon the federal government to explain why it's not using those legal powers to release these men from prolonged and indefinite detention,"" he said.

As a signatory to the 1951 Refugee Convention, Australia is obliged to provide a safe place of refuge for people fleeing persecution, or to resettle them elsewhere.

ABF Commissioner Outram said in his statement that the men are ""encouraged to finalize their medical treatment so they can continue on their resettlement pathway to the United States, return to Nauru or PNG or return to their home country.""

Manne said that despite many of their illnesses being severe or critical, there was ""significant information to cast doubt upon whether they are receiving or have received the medical treatment required.""

""It is abundantly clear that the prolonged, indefinite detention of these men, who were critically ill and brought to Australia for treatment, is almost certainly compounding the severity of their medical conditions,"" he said.

The immigration minister's spokeswoman said the men had access to medical professionals and specialists, and any claims to the contrary were incorrect.

Former immigration officer Rebecca Lim, from the Brisbane On-Arrival Refugee and Asylum Seeker Response Group, said volunteers were ready and waiting to help support the men in the Australian community -- when, and if, they are freed.

""If the minister is not making the decision to release the men into community detention because it is not in the public interest, then he needs to explain what that means,"" she said. ""Indefinite detention is wrong.""",2020-06-19,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/19/australia/australia-manus-nauru-hotel-brisbane-hnk-intl/index.html
Angus Watson,Australia says it has been targeted by a 'sophisticated' state-based cyber attack,"Sydney/Hong Kong (CNN Business) The Australian government is grappling with massive cyber attacks from what Prime Minister Scott Morrison has described as a ""malicious"" and ""sophisticated"" state-based actor.

Morrison revealed the existence of the attacks during a press conference on Friday, adding that a ""state-based cyber actor"" is ""targeting Australian organizations across a range of sectors, including all levels of government, industry, political organizations, education, health, essential service providers and operators of other critical infrastructure.""

He did not specify which agencies or businesses are believed to be under attack, nor did he detail the exact nature of the attacks — though he did say that the government's investigation has not uncovered any ""large-scale personal data breaches.""

Morrison also did not say which state Australia believes to be behind the attack. But he told reporters that ""there are not a large number of state-based actors that can engage in this type of activity.""

""It is clear ... that this has been done by a state-based actor with very, very significant capabilities,"" Morrison added.

Isaac Yee,Qantas cancels international flights until October. New Zealand may be the exception,"Hong Kong (CNN Business) Australian flagship carrier Qantas (QABSY) has canceled most of its international flights for the next four months on the expectation that the coronavirus pandemic will last through most of the year.

""With Australia's borders set to remain closed for some time, we have canceled most international flights until late October,"" Qantas said in a statement on Thursday.

There's one possible exception: New Zealand, Australia's neighbor across the Tasman Sea. Politicians have discussed the possibility of creating a travel corridor between the two countries — though nothing has been formally agreed yet. Currently, anyone traveling between the two countries is subject to a two-week quarantine. Non-residents of either country are banned from even flying those routes, with few exceptions.

Oscar Holland,'It looks like a virus': Australia's new trade logo proves controversial,"Written by Oscar Holland, CNN

Australia's national flower, the golden wattle, has long appeared on stamps, emblems and awards, and is considered a symbol of unity in the country.

But its use in a new logo promoting Australia's interests overseas has proven divisive, with some even likening the design to depictions of the coronavirus.

The controversial logo, which its designers say was partly inspired by Aboriginal art and culture, was suggested by the Nation Brand Advisory Council and approved by Australia's trade minister, Simon Birmingham. And while the council's proposal was submitted back in December 2019 -- long before Covid-19 was classified as a global pandemic -- social media users were quick to draw comparisons.

""I can't believe they have changed the Australian made logo to look like this, it looks like a virus,"" wrote Marck Coure, a New South Wales MP, on Twitter.

Queensland MP Duncan Pegg meanwhile tweeted , ""Wouldn't it have been better to get school students involved to design a new one?"" He added: ""I know they would do a better job than this rubbish!""

Both politicians were among a number of social media users to imply the wattle will replace the kangaroo symbol used to signify Australia-made products. But the golden wattle is reportedly intended to supersede the boomerang logo used by Australia Unlimited, which promotes the country's overseas trade and investment.

In an attempt to quell confusion, Australian Made issued a statement clarifying that the green and gold kangaroo will ""continue its pivotal role in Australia's domestic and overseas branding strategy.""

The Nation Brand Advisory Council, which comprises figures from across business, media and the arts, nonetheless questioned the effectiveness of a kangaroo logo in its rebranding proposal, asking whether the animal would ""shift perceptions of our nation, or simply reinforce what people already knew about us.""

Conversely, the report said, the golden wattle symbol ""provides a blank canvas, to tell a new Australian story.""

Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack told Australia's 9News that both symbols would be used to promote the country's interests, saying that the ""wattle is to attract attention at international trade shows."" Birmingham earlier confirmed to the channel that kangaroos, meanwhile, would ""continue to be a key part of Australia's marketing and logos from our Air Force to our tourism campaigns, our national airline and our sporting teams.""

Historic significance

Despite proving unpopular online, the golden wattle logo was intended to symbolize the flower's historic importance to both indigenous and non-indigenous Australians. According to the Nation Brand Advisory Council's proposal, the dotted design was inspired by Aboriginal art and was created in partnership with an indigenous design firm.

Found across the country, the golden wattle was traditionally used by Aboriginal communities, who would produce a toffee-like substance from its gum. Tannin from its bark was also known for having antiseptic properties. Colonial settlers later cultivated the plant for use in the tanning industry and to produce glue and honey, according to Australia's government

""The wattle has a long held significance for those that walk our land,"" read the council's proposal, which also outlines a new color palette and typeface for Australia's so-called Nation Brand. ""In Indigenous tradition the blooming of the wattle denotes that the bush has come alive with growth. Each dot represents individuals and the coming together of diversity. The animals are plentiful and the fish are full and fat.

""The hearty resilience of the wattle has come to represent the enduring spirit of the Australian people,"" it added.

The council's report said that market testing had indicated a positive response to the new branding, with approval rating of over 70% among respondents. ""Appeal for the wattle logo is strong,"" it claims.

Some on social media were more supportive of the idea. MasterChef Australia winner Adam Liaw took to Twitter to defend the thinking behind the design.

""Unpopular opinion, but pre-COVID this would've been great,"" he wrote . ""Gold and the 'Au' mark (also the elemental symbol for gold) establishes Australia as a premium brand, particularly through Asia.""

Jack Guy,The world's tallest hybrid timber tower to be built in Sydney,"Written by Jack Guy, CNN

Sydney could soon be home to the world's tallest hybrid timber building if a new project comes to fruition.

BVN design studio and New York -based SHoP Architects have been commissioned to build a new headquarters for software company Atlassian, which will be constructed using timber, steel and glass, according to a BVN press release.

The building will have approximately 40 floors and will feature natural ventilation and large planted terraces.

The hybrid construction could use 50% less embodied carbon than conventional techniques and, once completed, use 50% less energy than a conventional building.

It will also feature solar panels and operate on 100% renewable energy from the day it opens.

""Atlassian has their eyes set firmly on the future, this project will achieve a number of 'firsts' globally and in Australia,"" Ninotschka Titchkosky, BVN co-CEO, said in a statement.

""It will make what was once best practice seem inadequate and hopefully lift the ambition of the built environment across Australia.""

BVN were chosen as the design team, with SHoP as the architects. Credit: SHoP/BVN Architects

The building will use a technique known as Mass Timber Construction (MTC), involving a steel exoskeleton that supports the rest of the structure.

MTC is ""one of the most hopeful technologies in moving the construction industry toward real solutions to the global climate crisis,"" according to BVN.

The planned structure will incorporate the existing facade of an old parcel shed that currently houses a YHA youth hostel.

The building will stand in the tech precinct at Sydney's Central Station and could be completed by 2025, as part of a planned regeneration of the area that could provide workspace for some 25,000 employees, with 4,000 in the Atlassian building alone.

Offices around the world have closed due to the coronavirus pandemic and some companies have told employees they will be working from home for good. But Altassian is confident its planned building will respond to the new realities of working life.

With approximately 40 floors, the tower will be the tallest timber building in the world. Credit: SHoP/BVN Architects

""The space that we are building will be highly sustainable and highly flexible. It will be purpose-built for the future of work, for tomorrow's world, not today's,"" said Scott Farquhar, Atlassian co-founder and co-CEO, in the statement.

""Even with a highly distributed workforce, we'll need a place to come together. Now we can design this space especially for these new ways of working.""

Both Farquhar and local government leader Gladys Berejiklian, the New South Wales Premier, said the new district would generate jobs and drive the area's recovery from coronavirus.

Development applications will be submitted in the next few months, with construction to begin next year if approved.

The world's current tallest timber building is an 18-story tower in the Norwegian town of Brumunddal. The 280-foot-tall Mjøstårnet tower became the world's tallest timber building when it opened in 2019.

There is a growing body of evidence that timber can provide a sustainable alternative to concrete and steel. A slew of new timber high-rises is set to break ground or open in 2020.

HoHo Vienna, a mixed-use development just five feet shorter than Mjøstårnet, opened for business in Austria early in the year, and Pritzker Prize-winning architect Shigeru Ban has designed a ""hybrid"" condo complex comprising a steel and concrete core with a timber frame that will open this year in Vancouver, Canada.",2020-07-12,https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/sydney-hybrid-timber-tower-scli-intl/index.html
Cnn Staff,Kids Q&A with Dr. Sanjay Gupta and Carl Azuz: Coronavirus podcast for April 27,"(CNN) Children around the world have been impacted by Covid-19, and they understandably have curiosity and concerns about what's going on. CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta is joined by CNN10 anchor Carl Azuz to answer some of the key questions on kids' minds these days.

Gupta: Today's episode is going to be a little different. So far on this podcast I've spoken to a lot of adults -- scientists, doctors, and even an astronaut.

But they're not the only ones thinking about the coronavirus. Kids are listening and asking questions, too. Oftentimes, they ask the questions that adults are too embarrassed to ask. We've heard from a bunch of you and I hope I can help you understand what's going on right now.

I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent. And this is ""Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction.""

Gupta: A lot of kids around the world want to know when they can see their friends again.

I wish I could tell you I knew exactly when you could go back to having playdates and learning from your teachers in person, but there's just no answer to that yet. That's one of the hardest things about life during this time -- not having answers.

But I've gotten some amazing questions from you, and I'm going to try and answer them the best I can. I've also brought in my friend Carl Azuz -- many of you probably know him as the anchor of CNN10 in classrooms across the country.

Carl Azuz (on CNN10): We know what it's doing, we know where it's spreading, but where did Covid-19 come from? That's the first thing we're looking at today on CNN10 and we're happy to have you along for the hunt.

Gupta: Hey Carl!

Azuz: Sanjay, it's always a pleasure to work with you. Thank you for thinking of me.

Gupta: So, let's jump right in. Our first question comes from Micah in Maryland.

Micah: I wonder where the coronavirus came from. If it was from bats, how did it change or mutate? Thank you, stay well.

Gupta: Thanks, Micah. Scientists do think that this coronavirus did come from bats in China. What we're not entirely sure about is exactly how it got into humans. It could be that the bat made another animal sick and then that animal got a human sick. Or it could be that it spread directly from bats to humans. It is also possible that the bats were studied in a lab and that the virus spread to humans that way. We just don't know yet. Next we have a question from PJ in Florida.

PJ: Will we have to wear masks in public forever? Thank you.

Azuz: I have good news for you, PJ. No, we are not going to have to wear masks in public forever, although some people might think they're pretty fashionable and want to keep it going. That's the good news. The bad news is we don't know when we'll be able to take them off.

Gupta: That's right, Carl. And I think it's also important to remember that when you wear a mask, it's to help protect other people from you. It makes it less likely that you can spread the germs from you to somebody else. Remember, even if you're not sick, even if you're not coughing or sneezing, if you have the virus inside your body, you could possibly spread it to others. A mask helps prevent you from doing that.

Azuz: Alright, Sachin is in New York City with our next question.

Sachin: What do the germs look like? What do the germs feel like when you have them?

Azuz: Sachin, I have no idea what germs look like. I think Dr. Sanjay Gupta might be the best person to answer that one.

Gupta: Sachin, the thing about germs and viruses like this is that they are too small for us to see or feel even on our skin. But that doesn't mean that scientists haven't been able to use microscopes and get a good look at them. This coronavirus is called coronavirus because corona means crown. So this looks like a little blob with a crown on top of it. That crown is actually a bunch of little spikes that the virus uses to move around and to get inside the body. That's the reason you have to wash your hands a lot, because when you use soap and water, you can actually clean those germs off your hands even if you can't see it happening. Even though you can't see these germs or these viruses, they are all over the place. They're on door handles, sometimes they're on your toys. But the good news is that many of these germs aren't going to make you that sick. Now we have a question from Abby, in Washington, DC.

Abby: My question about coronavirus is: Will I be able to go to camp and different places in the summer?

Gupta: Abby, this is probably the number one question that I get even in my own home. What are things going to be like this summer? Well, Abby, there's a good chance that we may still have to be home this summer. We still don't know yet. We got to make sure that in different places around the country, things are headed in the right direction, that there are fewer people getting sick, that more people can get tested. When we get to that point, we may start to slowly open things back up. The one thing, Abby, we don't want to happen is that more people get sick that didn't need to because they went out too early. Now we have a question from Leonard in California.

Leonard: Are there any drugs that can actually help you not get this virus?

Azuz: Well I don't know if I would call it a drug, Leonard, but I can say that washing your hands is a really good way to keep yourself safe from this virus.

Dr. Gupta: Yep, right now, the only medications for this coronavirus are ones that help treat your symptoms. So if you have a cough, runny nose or a fever, there are certain medicines that can help with that. But there are scientists all around the world in labs who are working at different treatments to treat the virus itself. And hopefully by the summer, we may have some good answers on that.

Azuz: You know Sanjay, you are a doctor, you're going to have some pretty good points. And that was another one. You want to make sure that you are doing other things you can do just to keep yourself healthy, besides washing your hands, to eat a healthy diet. Fruits and vegetables. Make sure you get lots of sleep. Make sure you get some exercise as long as you're, you know, not getting too close to other people. And it's a good idea to do that, whether or not there's a threat from coronavirus. Santiago in California is next.

Santiago: Will more families become poorer after this passes? I'm worried that my family or other families will become hungry or homeless.

Azuz: Santiago, that's a very important question. I'm sorry that you're worried about it. As far as families becoming poorer, we do know that a lot of people have lost their jobs. There are a lot of folks who are unable to work right now because businesses are closed down. But there are also a lot of folks helping others. For one thing, the US government has spent trillions of dollars trying to get money to people in need. Also, we've heard from a number of different charity organizations.

We know some churches are involved in helping their communities. And then there are some folks who are just giving lunches to students who might normally get those at school but can't because of the coronavirus. So the good thing here, Santiago, is the fact that so many people are helping others in different communities. And that's something that gives us all hope. And last question is from North Carolina. Sydney, what's on your mind?

Sydney: When will the coronavirus be over? When will the scientists get a cure for the coronavirus and how will they find it?

Azuz: Thanks for the question, Sydney. If it were up to me, it would be over in five minutes. Everybody would be healthy. You'd be able to go back to school, hang out with your friends, go to concerts, all the fun stuff that you and your parents love to do.

Gupta: That's right, Carl. Sydney, everybody wants the answer to this question. One thing we need to make sure we can do is start to test people for the virus. Letting them know whether they have it in their bodies and making sure that if they do, they don't spread it to other people. Right now, Sydney, one of the most promising things out there is that scientists are working on finding a vaccine. That's a medicine that can help teach your body how to fight the virus. We probably won't have a vaccine until next year some time. But once that happens, that will protect us against this virus, just like a flu shot protects you against the flu.

Gupta: These have all been really great questions. Thank you so much for sending them in. And Carl, thank you very much. I really appreciate it. You have such a great way of talking to kids. I know they adore you.

Azuz: Hey, thank you, Sanjay. Always a pleasure working with you. Happy to be here.

Gupta: Before I sign off, I want to talk directly to parents.

Sometimes it's really hard to figure out how to explain what's going on right now to kids. I know, because I've had to talk to my own kids about it.

Even if your kids are young, or aren't asking about it, experts say it's a good idea to start a conversation with them to see if they have questions or worries that they haven't yet expressed.

Benazir Wehelie,Show animals and their proud handlers,"Story highlights Jooney Woodward took portraits of show animals and their handlers in the UK

The livestock shows are just as much business events as they are social gatherings

(CNN) Every year, animal handlers travel throughout England and Wales to compete at agricultural shows.

Jooney Woodward's ""Best in Show"" is a documentation of those competitions, with photos that place a spotlight on the handlers and their animals.

""When you go to (the shows), they tend to be all about the animals -- people photographing the animals,"" Woodward said. ""I just wanted to turn my attention onto the people because they're so committed to what they do. They're really devoted and hardworking.""

While those involved with the competitions are the focus of many press photographers, Woodward's work stands out for its distinctive portraiture style.

""My work is a bit more composed. I use a medium-format camera and a tripod, so it is a bit more static in a way,"" she said. ""I think everybody is so proud of their animals that when I said to them that, 'I'd love a portrait of you and your cow,' everyone was more than willing to give up their time and help because they're so passionate about what they do.""

Allie Torgan,"From tourist to altruist, how a New Yorker embraced Vietnam","Hoi An, Vietnam (CNN) New Yorker Neal Bermas had traveled around the world, but Vietnam literally stopped him in his tracks.

There, the businessman saw starving children in Ho Chi Minh City while on a trip to Asia in 1999.

""There were bands of these poor, homeless kids on the streets ... and they were begging for milk, not for money,"" Bermas said. ""It stayed with me.""

Bermas, who did consulting for hotels and restaurants, saw there was an effort under way to help street kids get simple food service jobs. He realized he could help.

Combining his business savvy with an ambitious nonprofit model, in 2007 he co-founded STREETS International , based in Hoi An. The organization provides at-risk young people with a rigorous 18-month training program, preparing them for careers in Vietnam's booming culinary and hospitality industries.

""(They) come from the whole country with all kinds of very, very difficult paths,"" Bermas said. ""We offer them a structured program and a very rich apprenticing experience.""

STREETS' participants range in age from 16 to 22. The group provides housing, meals, medical care, clothing and support services to help trainees gain skills and confidence for employment at top resorts.

Some come from more than 600 miles away to participate in the free program. They receive a stipend and transportation assistance to visit their family.

""We build possibilities and aspirations for those communities,"" Bermas said. ""Where we take one young person from the village, suddenly ... the whole village starts to think about, 'maybe my kid, too.'""

Currently, 75 trainees are enrolled. The group's full-time staff and teachers are all Vietnamese, and Bermas often brings in chefs and other experts to enhance the training.

He and his team work with the government and ensure they follow all safety and labor laws and regulations.

By the end of this year, nearly 250 young people will have completed the program. Bermas said 100% of STREETS graduates have found employment, mostly at four- and five-star hotels in Vietnam.

""It works. And that's a push to do more to reach more young people,"" he said, adding that the group stays in regular contact with all graduates for at least two years after graduation, most longer.

Bermas plans to expand the program to other areas of the country.

CNN's Allie Torgan spoke with Bermas about his work. Below is an edited version of their conversation.

CNN: Who are the young people applying to your program?

Bermas: All the young people in our program come from poverty -- without enough to eat, without electricity and plumbing. From leprosy villages, from HIV backgrounds; some have been trafficked, sometimes more than once.

Part of the process of selecting and getting to know the trainees is that we visit wherever they're from -- the home, in many cases the orphanage, the NGO, the isolated village, sometimes even a street corner. We want to know the most about them we possibly can, how difficult their conditions have been and how they have been wounded by life. Or what support there is. It's a great resource to a young person's development in our program.

This is the first real chance for many (of them) to transition from poverty and life on the streets to the dignity of self-sufficiency that comes with a successful career. You shouldn't discount a young person's future because of their past, no matter how dire it's been.

CNN: You've created an extensive program. Besides the hands-on culinary and hospitality training, what else is involved?

Bermas: There's a whole team of colleagues, educators and professionals who have worked developing all this. We have daily curriculums and lesson plans, from the first day to the last day -- designed to deliver quite sophisticated, substantive material.

We have a computer language lab. We have tutoring every day of the week. English language instruction is a big part. And a whole array of life skills, from hygiene to CPR, budgeting and banking, physical exercise and being healthy.

Depending on which track the trainees are going, they have classroom experience in a small teaching kitchen if they're becoming professional chefs, or in the classroom to learn about hospitality and service. And our three eateries have many purposes; each one brings a different set of skills for apprenticing.

CNN: You left Manhattan behind to do this. Why did you decide to move to Vietnam?

Bermas: The truth is, the early vision was that I would work with colleagues and assemble a team here. And I could travel back and forth and make sure everything was going well.

It became clear very early on that if I was to really realize this ambition on behalf of the young people in the program, I would have to be here and do it. It was probably the best, if not certainly the most meaningful, decision I've made in my adult life.

This work at STREETS is never easy, but it's important. I know now that I need to be sure there is a STREETS around 10 years from now.

CNN: You've kept your focus on the local community. How have they embraced you?

Bermas: It's traditional here in Vietnam when you open a new business that the business community and friends and family all send you large wreaths of flowers opening day to wish you good luck.

The day we opened the restaurant -- we'd been working so hard to open, to get this thing going -- and I came down the street, and there were so many of these big, beautiful wreaths full of flowers that said in Vietnamese, ""Congratulations"" and ""Welcome."" And who had sent them? All the local shops and friends we had made. I was so touched by this.

The flowers poured out into the street. It was amazing. I literally couldn't get in the front door of the restaurant.

Sugam Pokharel,Nepal's Organ Trail: How traffickers steal kidneys,"Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN) On the streets of Kathmandu, the sight of people begging for kidney treatment has become common.

The capital of Nepal is no different from many places in the world where aging populations, poor diets and no health insurance systems mean increased organ disease.

The organ in highest demand is the kidney and black market traffickers are meeting that demand. Up to 7,000 kidneys are obtained illegally every year, according to a report by Global Financial Integrity

Organ trafficking is an illegal, yet thriving trade around the globe.

That same report shows the illegal organ trade generates profits between $514 million to $1 billion a year.

In Kathmandu, we spotted a couple begging on the street for their son's kidney treatment.

Jeet Bahadur Magar and his wife spent their entire savings to treat their son's kidney disease.

Out of money and options, they are now out on the street hoping to raise enough funds to cover the medical bills.

""I pray to God that no one has to ever go through kidney failure problems,"" Jeet Bahadur said.

But many Nepalis do.

During our visit, Nepal Kidney Center in Kathmandu was packed with patients having dialysis -- a grueling four-hour process of purifying blood through a machine.

A patient can avoid the kidney transplant by having dialysis at least three times a week.

Those lucky enough to afford a transplant still face obstacles: the donor must match the blood group of the recipients and Nepali law requires the organ donor to be a family member.

Nepal's 'kidney bank'

We traveled to Kavre, a tiny district close to Kathmandu, and what activists and authorities say is a ground zero for the black market organ trade in Nepal.

Here, kidney trafficking rackets -- well organized and well funded -- dupe the poor and uneducated into giving away a piece of themselves.

The district has developed an unfortunate reputation as the ""kidney bank of Nepal.""

For more than 20 years, activists say, people from villages in Kavre have been the primary source of kidneys for sick and desperate patients throughout Nepal. But now the numbers are being tracked.

In the last five years more than 300 people have been reported to be victims of kidney traffickers in this district alone, according to Forum for Protection of People's Rights , a Kathmandu-based non-profit human rights organization. Some activists say the number is much higher.

""Social stigma and threats from traffickers keep many victims from coming forward,"" said Rajendra Ghimire, a human rights lawyer, and director of Forum for Protection of People's Rights.

'The meat will grow back'

Nawaraj Pariyar is one of the many victims of kidney traffickers.

Like many in Kavre, Pariyar makes a living from selling cattle milk and doing seasonal labor jobs on nearby farms. Poor and uneducated, all he has is two cows, a house and a tiny plot of land.

JUST WATCHED Victims tell their story. Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Victims tell their story. 01:01

Pariyar used to visit Kathmandu to find construction work. He was on a site in 2000 when the foreman approached him with a dubious offer: if he let doctors cut out a ""hunk of meat"" from his body, he would be given 30 lakhs -- about $30,000.

What he wasn't told: the piece of ""meat"" was actually his kidney.

""The foreman told me that the meat will grow back,"" Pariyar said.

""Then I thought, 'If the meat will regrow again, and I get about $30,000, why not?'""

""What if I die?"" Pariyar remembers asking the foreman.

The foreman assured Pariyar that nothing would happen. He was given good food and clothes, and was even taken to see a movie.

Then he was escorted to a hospital in Chennai, a southern state of India.

Traffickers assigned a fake name to Pariyar and told the hospital he was a relative of the recipient. The traffickers, Pariyar says, had all the fake documents ready to prove his false identity.

""At the hospital, the doctor asked me if the recipient was my sister. I was told by the traffickers to say yes. So I did,"" Pariyar said.

""I heard them repeatedly saying 'kidney'. But I had no idea what 'kidney' meant. I only knew Mirgaula (the Nepali term for kidney.)

""Since I didn't know the local language, I couldn't understand any conversation between the trafficker and the hospital staff.""

Pariyar was discharged and sent home with about 20,000 Nepali rupees -- less than one percent of the agreed amount -- and a promise he would have the rest shortly.

He never received any more money and never found the trafficker.

""After I came back to Nepal, I had a doubt. So, I went to the doctor. That's when I found out I am missing a kidney,"" Pariyar said.

Pariyar is now sick and getting worse by the day. He has a urinary problem and constant severe back pain.

But he cannot afford a trip to the doctor and is afraid he will die.

""If I die I can only hope for the government to take care of my two children. I don't know if I will die today or tomorrow. I'm just counting my days,"" Pariyar said.

Pariyar's experience is one of many similar stories we heard in Kavre.

Understanding the economic situation in this district is the key to understanding why so many people here easily fall prey to kidney traffickers.

There are hardly any other economic opportunities other than substantial farming and rearing livestock. One bad harvest or a big medical bill can easily ruin families.

""The main reason is poverty and lack of awareness. It is very easy for the traffickers to brainwash the villagers. Also, the villages in Kavre are close to the capital and are easily accessible,"" Ghimire said.

Indian links

Traffickers use proxies at different stages of the process. First, someone will approach the victim, another will create the donor's fake documents and then another will escort the donor to the hospital.

Few hospitals in Nepal perform kidney transplants. And even the doctors in Nepal know most well-heeled patients prefer to go across the border to India.

Two brothers who were duped by kidney traffickers show their scars

""They want better services, they want Indian doctors. That's why they go to the hospitals in India,"" said Dr. Rishi Kumar Kafle, Director of the National Kidney Center.

But activists have other explanations for the demand for Indian surgeries.

""It is hard to cross-check Nepali records across the border, so traffickers prefer to take the donors to India,"" Ghimire said.

We noted, before any kidney operation can be carried out in India, the hospital requires a No Objection Certificate, a letter drafted by the Nepali embassy in New Delhi confirming the donor as the kidney recipient's relative.

Photographs of the recipient and the relative, who would be the legitimate donor, were not included in the letter until recently.

Since Indian hospitals accept official Nepali documents, anyone could show up at the hospital, provide papers saying they were that person and have their kidney removed.

Activists say this is the loophole traffickers used for many years.

With the easy availability of forged documents, traffickers can beat the system.

While the Nepali government tries to tighten policies, Nepal's police officers are trying to crack down on the criminal rings.

Last year authorities arrested 10 people accused of organ trafficking in Kavre. Their case is still in court.

Sub-inspector Dipendra Chand, who led the police investigation, says stopping the underground trade is difficult.

""If we crackdown in one village, the traffickers simply move to another,"" Chand said.

Rajendra Ghimire says that the trafficking rings are now moving beyond Kavre.

""We have reports that this problem is expanding into other surrounding districts as well,"" Ghimire said.

The attention to this problem is growing in Kavre. Kidney trafficking stories are making headlines on the local and national newspapers.

But for victims like Pariyar and others, the media attention is too late.",2014-06-26,https://edition.cnn.com/2014/06/26/world/asia/freedom-project-nepals-organ-trail/index.html
Julie Guinan,Guatemala: Gender-based violence at epidemic levels,"(CNN) For 12 years Adelma Cifuentes felt worthless, frightened and alone, never knowing when her abusive husband would strike.

But as a young mother in rural Guatemala with three children and barely a third grade education, she thought there was no way out.

What began as psychological torment, name-calling and humiliation turned into beatings so severe Cifuentes feared for her life. One day, two men sent by her husband showed up at her house armed with a shotgun and orders to kill her. They probably would have succeeded, but after the first bullet was fired, Cifuentes' two sons dragged her inside. Still, in her deeply conservative community, it took neighbors two hours to call for help and Cifuentes lost her arm.

But the abuse didn't stop there. When she returned home, Cifuentes' husband continued his attacks and threatened to rape their little girl unless she left. That's when the nightmare finally ended and her search for justice began.

Guatamala's past still haunts

Cifuentes' case is dramatic, but in Guatemala, where nearly 10 out of every 100,000 women are killed, it's hardly unusual.

Many women in Guatemala's patriarcal socity are trapped in a cycle of violence.

A 2012 Small Arms Survey says gender-based violence is at epidemic levels in Guatemala and the country ranks third in the killings of women worldwide. According to the United Nations, two women are killed there every day.

There are many reasons why, beginning with the legacy of violence left in place after the country's 36-year-old civil war. During the conflict, atrocities were committed against women, who were used as a weapon of war. In 1996, a ceasefire agreement was reached between insurgents and the government. But what followed and what remains is a climate of terror, due to a deeply entrenched culture of impunity and discrimination. Military and paramilitary groups that committed barbaric acts during the war were integrated back into society without any repercussions. Many remain in power, and they have not changed the way they view women.

Some 200,000 people were either killed or disappeared during the decades-long conflict, most of them from indigenous Mayan populations. Nearly 20 years later, according to the Security Sector Reform Resource Centre, levels of violent crime are higher in Guatemala than they were during the war. But despite the high homicide rate, the United Nations estimates 98% of cases never make it to court. Women are particularly vulnerable because of a deep-rooted gender bias and culture of misogyny. In many cases, femicide -- the killing of a woman simply because of her gender -- is carried out with shocking brutality with some of the same strategies used during the war, including rape, torture and mutilation.

Explosion in violence

Mexican drug cartels, organized criminal groups and local gangs are contributing to the vicious cycle of violence and lawlessness. Authorities investigating drug-related killings are stretched thin, leaving fewer resources to investigate femicides. In many cases, crime is not reported because of fear of retaliation. Many consider the Guatamalen National Civil Police, or PNC, corrupt, under-resourced and ineffective. Even if a case does get prosecuted, according to Human Rights Watch, the country's weak judicial system has proved incapable of handling the explosion in violence.

Prevailing culture of machismo

Perhaps one of the biggest challenges facing women in Guatemala is the country's deeply rooted patriarchal society.

According to María Machicado Terán, the representative of U.N. women in Guatemala, ""80% of men believe that women need permission to leave the house, and 70% of women surveyed agreed."" This prevailing culture of machismo and an institutionalized acceptance of brutality against women leads to high rates of violence. Rights groups say machismo not only condones violence, it places the blame on the victim.

Make an impact: Help stop gender-based violence CARE provides medical, legal, psychosocial and protection services to those experiencing violence

U.S. National Committee for UN Women promotes social, political and economic equality for women and girls

The political will to address violence against women is slow to materialize.

""Politicians don't think women are important,"" says former Secretary General of the Presidential Secretariat for Women Elizabeth Quiroa. ""Political parties use women for elections. They give them a bag of food and people sell their dignity for this because they are poor.""

Lack of education is a major contributor to this poverty. Many girls, especially in indigenous communities don't go to school because the distance from their house to the classroom is too far.

Quiroa says ""They are subject to rape, violence and forced participation in the drug trade.""

Signs of progress

Although the situation for girls and women in Guatemala is alarming, there are signs the culture of discrimination may be slowly changing. With the help of an organization known as CICAM, or Centro de Investigación, Cifuentes was finally able to escape her husband and get the justice she deserved. He is now spending 27 years behind bars.

Cifuentes is using her painful past to provide hope and healing to others through art.

Since 2008, she and four other abuse survivors known as La Poderosas, or ""The Powerful,"" have been appearing in a play based on their real life stories.

Five Guatemalan abuse survivors known as La Poderosas or ""The Powerful"" share their stories and help other women get support.

The show not only empowers other women and discusses the problem of violence openly, but it also offers suggestions for change. And it's having an impact. Women have started breaking their silence and asking where they can get support. Men are reacting, too. One of the main characters, Lesbia Téllez, says during one presentation, a man stood up and started crying when he realized how he had treated his wife and how his mother had been treated. He said he wanted to be different.

The taboo topic of gender-based violence is also being acknowledged and recognized in a popular program targeting one of Guatemala's most vulnerable groups, indigenous Mayan girls. In 2004, with help from the United Nations and other organizations, the Population Council launched a community-based club known as Abriendo Oportunidades, or ""Opening Opportunities"". The goal is to provide girls with a safe place to learn about their rights and reach their full potential.

Senior Program Coordinator Alejandra Colom says the issue of violence is discussed and girls are taught how to protect themselves. ""They then share this information with their mothers and for the first time, they realize they are entitled to certain rights.""

Colom adds that mothers then become invested in sending their daughters to the clubs and this keeps them more visible and less prone to violence.

The Guatemalan government is also moving in the right direction to address the problem of violence against women. In 2008, the Congress passed a law against femicide. Two years later the attorney general's office created a specialized court to try femicides and other violent crimes against women. In 2012, the government established a joint task force for crimes against women, making it easier for women to access justice by making sure victims receive the assistance they need. The government has also established a special 24-hour court to attend to femicide cases. On the global front, the International Violence Against Women Act was introduced in the U.S. Congress in 2007; it has been pending ever since. But last week the act was reintroduced in both the House and Senate. If approved, it would make reducing levels of gender-based violence a U.S. foreign policy priority.

Pehaps the most immediate and effective help is coming from International nongovernmental organizations, which are on the front lines of the fight against gender-based discrimination in Guatemala.

Adelma Cifuentes shares her story to empower women and bring about awareness of Guatemala's history of gender-based violence.

Ben Weingrod, a senior policy advocate at the global poverty fighting group CARE, says, ""We work to identify and challenge harmful social norms that perpetuate violence. Our work includes engaging men and boys as champions of change and role models, and facilitating debates to change harmful norms and create space for more equitable relationships between men and women.""

But the job is far from over. While there is tempered optimism and hope for change, the problem of gender-based violence in Guatemala is one that needs international attention and immediate action.

Cifuentes is finding strength through the theater and the support of other abuse survivors, which has allowed her to move forward. But millions of other women trapped in a cycle of violence are facing dangerous and frightening futures. For them, it's a race against time and help cannot come soon enough.",2015-04-02,https://edition.cnn.com/2015/04/02/world/iyw-guatemala-gender-violence/index.html

One company demonstrating this entrepreneurial drive is fresh food suppliers SKC Surat.

""My father Sooklall Surat, started as a farmer with one hectare of land,"" says Suren Surat, who is now CEO of the company his father founded sixty years ago. ""The land was next to our house, where we lived. My father was the first grower at that time, the pioneer for growing strawberries and artichokes in Mauritius.""

Suren Surat has been part of the company from the beginning. The family had enough offspring to start a cricket squad, but the team dedicated its efforts towards business success.

Andrew O'Reilly,"Trump Jr. defends president's drop in polls, dings Biden's populist 'made in America' plan","President Trump’s oldest son defended on Sunday his father’s reelection chances amid flagging poll numbers and criticized presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden’s economic plan as “asinine.”

Speaking on “Sunday Morning Futures,” Donald Trump Jr. blamed the president’s drop in the polls on the media coverage Trump has received recently – saying news outlets have been critical of the president while ignoring going after Biden.

“I think when you have the media onslaught where media has just totally abdicated their position to objectively look at both sides,” Trump Jr. said. “They're not looking into any of Biden's past. They're not looking into any of his history.”

He added: “They want to do whatever they can to keep the American people from actually seeing Biden. He hasn't been defined. And the media is trying to make sure that no one gets to define Joe Biden, because once he is, you'll see how terrible this notion could be for America.”

PROFESSOR DOUBLES DOWN ON PREDICTION MODEL OF TRUMP'S CHANCES IN 2020

While the polling gap between Trump and Biden has narrowed a bit since the former vice president held a double-digit led over the current White House occupant late last month, a RealClearPolitics average of polls still has Biden up nine points on the president with less than five months to go before November’s general election.

Trump Jr. also hit Biden on the Democratic candidate’s recently released “Build Back Better” plan, which proposes spending $700 billion on American products and research -- in the hopes of bringing back millions of jobs lost by an economy flattened by the coronavirus pandemic.

“You know that Joe Biden can sell this notion of ‘now we're going to be buy American after 50 years of legislation that sent our jobs, that sent our American Dream to China,’” Trump Jr. said. “It's asinine.”

Trump Jr. also accused Biden of using his time in public office to enrich his own family and once again questioned why the media isn’t looking into the matter.

“I called it liberal privilege because we hear a lot about privilege these days, but liberal privilege is the ultimate because they can say one thing, do the other and never get called on it,” he said.

In an interview earlier this year, Trump Jr. called out Hunter Biden's business deals in Ukraine while his father was vice president.



“I was an international business person before my father got into politics. That’s what we did. I’m not going to say I haven’t benefited from my father’s last name, just like Hunter Biden did. That’d be foolish to say,” Trump Jr. said during an interview with Axios in March. “But, I haven’t benefited from my father’s taxpayer-funded office.”

“All of the sudden, he [Hunter Biden] goes over to the Ukraine and he’s making 83K a month, so the media likes to do this, sort of false equivalence. ‘You’re doing this, you’re doing that,” Trump Jr. said at the time. “We stopped doing any new international business deals when my father won the presidency.”

Joe Biden on Thursday introduced his plan that also seeks to create 5 million new jobs and is the first of four economic proposals Biden is expected to roll out over the coming weeks.

The American-centric proposals spotlighted by Biden will compete in this year’s White House race with the “America first” agenda long pushed by Trump, who has emphasized protecting American workers and reenergizing domestic industries in decline while moving away from free trade and a global economy.

The first part of the former vice president's proposal is a $400 billion investment by the federal government to purchase American products such as cement, concrete, steel, and other materials to rebuild the nation’s crumbling infrastructure.

The second part is a $300 billion investment in research for new technologies, such as electric vehicles, artificial intelligence, and 5G.

Biden’s plan also calls for new tax breaks and credits for small manufacturers – including those run by minorities and women – and would levy penalties on companies who take federal money and then move their investments overseas. The campaign says that Biden will also push federal investments toward overlooked parts of the country that have not received government help.

Biden’s proposals appear to be an acknowledgment of the political success the president has enjoyed pushing his “America First” agenda. Trump's victory in the 2016 presidential election was in part due to his promises of bringing back American jobs and re-inflating flagging industries. And as president, he's waged an aggressive trade war with China and slapped tariffs on other nations, including longtime allies.

Andrew O'Reilly,"Leave DACA alone, Trump told by business titans following SCOTUS ruling","A group of business leaders representing some of the largest companies in the country urged President Trump over the weekend to leave alone an Obama-era program that shields around 650,000 young immigrants from deportation – arguing in a letter to the president that any changes would cause further economic problems and hinder the fight against the coronavirus.

The letter -- sent from members of the Coalition for the American Dream -- comes less than a month after the Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration improperly ended the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, in 2017, and just a day after Trump said he plans to sign an executive order in the next few weeks which will include a “road to citizenship” for recipients of the program.

“As large American employers and employer organizations, we strongly urge you to leave the DACA program in place,” the letter stated. “DACA recipients have been critical members of our workforce, industries, and communities for years now, and they have abided by the laws and regulations of our country in order to maintain their DACA status.”

The letter -- which was signed by more than 100 executives and business leaders including those from Amazon, Apple, General Motors, Google, IBM, Microsoft and Starbucks – continued: “This is no time to disrupt the economic recovery of our companies and communities, nor time to jeopardize the health and safety of these vulnerable individuals.”

SUPREME COURT RULES AGAINST TRUMP ADMINISTRATION BID TO END DACA PROGRAM

The DACA program grew out of an impasse over a comprehensive immigration bill between Congress and the Obama administration in 2012. Under intense pressure from young activists, President Obama decided to formally protect people from deportation and allow them to work legally in the U.S.

DACA currently serves as a protection for young immigrants that were brought to the U.S. illegally as children, also referred to as Dreamers, to allow them to legally study, work and remain in the U.S. without fear of deportation.

Immigrants who are part of DACA will keep those protections following the Supreme Court ruling, but there are tens of thousands of others who could have enrolled if Trump didn't halt the program three years ago.

The Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, estimates that about 66,000 young immigrants meet the age requirement to join the program — 15 — but haven't been able to do so because the government has only been renewing two-year permits for those already enrolled.

Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden said that if elected, he would send lawmakers proposed legislation on his first day in office to make DACA protections permanent.

GRAHAM SAYS TRUMP 'RECEPTIVE' TO DACA PACKAGE AFTER MEETING WITH GOP SENATORS

Trump, who ran in 2016 on a platform that included clamping down on immigration, has flip-flopped on his stance toward DACA recipients.

During the last presidential campaign, he vowed to repeal DACA, but after his election, he softened his stance and said at one point that DACA recipients had nothing to worry about. Still, under pressure from immigration hard-liners in the GOP, he announced in 2017 that he was ending the program.

Trump and a bipartisan group of senators hit a stalemate in January 2018 after a compromise immigration bill was presented that would protect DACA recipients. But Trump would not agree to the measure because it did not include a provision for the U.S.- Mexico border wall, eventually leading to the longest government shutdown in U.S. history.

Most recently, Trump on Friday vowed to sign an executive order that would provide a “road to citizenship” for DACA recipients.

“I’m going to do a big executive order; I have the power to do it as president and I’m going to make DACA a part of it,” Trump said in an interview with Telemundo anchor José Díaz-Balart.

Trump added that the order wouldn’t just be for temporary relief, but would be a far more encompassing merit-based bill.

While it is unclear whether the president can grant DACA recipients a path to citizenship through executive powers, he stated it is his intention Friday.

“One of the aspects of the bill is going to be DACA. We are going to have a road to citizenship,” Trump told Daiz-Balart.

Talia Kaplan,Sen. Barrasso on what needs to be included in next coronavirus stimulus bill,"The focus of the next coronavirus stimulus bill “has to be getting people back to work” and getting “paychecks back into their pockets,” Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., said on Sunday.

Barrasso made the comments one week before Congress is scheduled to return to Washington to start hammering out the next stimulus bill. The bipartisan talks will take place as the extra $600 in weekly unemployment benefits is set to expire at the end of the month.

“There’s a consensus we need to do another bill, that’ll be in the next couple of weeks,” Barrasso said in an exclusive interview on “Sunday Morning Futures.”

He then explained what he thinks should be included in the “Phase 4” coronavirus stimulus bill.

“It has to focus on getting people back to work and children back in school,” he said, adding that it must also “focus on saving lives.”

“To me, that means more testing, better treatment and then, of course, a vaccine,” Barrasso, who is a doctor, explained.

“Finally, we need to provide the liability insurance for our healthcare workers, for our mom and pop small businesses and for our schools so they can all open in a good way,” he continued.

Barrasso then brought up the fact that the Democratic-controlled House approved a $3 trillion proposal in May, which Senate Republicans deemed dead on arrival. He said the Democrat’s proposal depicts House Speaker Nancy Pelosi “living in handout heaven.”

Pelosi has said priorities for the next round of coronavirus legislation include money to state and local governments, more coronavirus testing, and more direct payments for Americans.

“It’s direct checks to illegal immigrants, it’s bailouts to big city and state pension plans that are run by Democrats,” Barrasso said on Sunday. “We’re not going to do that.”

If legislation comes to fruition, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has said it would pass this month before lawmakers leave for recess in August.

President Trump told Fox Business he supports another round of stimulus checks, which could be even larger than $1,200.

However, not all Republicans are on the same page. The recent record-breaking June jobs report, which showed the creation of 4.8 million nonfarm payroll positions last month, has caused some lawmakers – like Louisiana Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy – to question the need for more direct payments.

Barrasso acknowledged on Sunday that the question is if the next round of stimulus should “include additional relief checks for people who have still not been able to get back to work, certainly in hard-hit industries, whether it’s the service industry, the hospitality industry.”

“We did that once before, but that was people up to $95,000, we’re looking at a lower number there,” he continued.

Barrasso noted that there is an “urgency to get this done” because of upcoming deadlines as it pertains to the enhanced unemployment insurance and the Paycheck Protection Program, which he said “has been so successful” and has “helped keep about 50 million people on a payroll.”

Host Maria Bartiromo noted that Congress has another scheduled recess starting on August 8 and asked Barrasso, “Should I assume we will have another stimulus package in that three week period?”

“There is [a] general agreement we need to work to that end and we need to deal with the issues affecting our nation,” he said in response.

“There are still people who can’t go back to work through no fault of their own because of the disease, because of maybe medical conditions.”

“We need to make sure that they are cared for, but we cannot continue to pay people more to sit at home than to go to work and we have so many help wanted signs around Wyoming and the country,” he continued.

“We need to do all we can to get people back to work and help them earn that paycheck,” Barrasso stressed.

Stephen Sorace,"Federal officer in Portland struck with hammer during protests, several arrested","A federal officer in Portland, Ore., was struck in the head and shoulder with a hammer during protests outside a courthouse Friday night that resulted in several arrests, authorities said.

Several dozen protesters were gathered in the street outside the Justice Center when the demonstration turned violent, Portland police said in a news release.

PORTLAND POLICE SAY PROTESTS, RIOTS HAVE COST BUSINESSES SOME $23M

An individual was trying to break down the door to the Mark O. Hatfield U.S. Courthouse with a hammer when federal officers inside the building responded, police said.

The hammer-wielding suspect made a hole in the door before “deliberately” hitting a federal officer in the head and shoulder with the tool, police said. The officer's condition was not immediately available.

Federal officers used pepper spray and CS gas during the incident, police said. One arrest was made.

Police recovered the nearly 16-inch long hammer and released aerial footage from the scene near the Justice Center, which showed at least one fire lit and protesters blocking a street.

Over the course of the night, a second individual was arrested for vandalizing government property, while two others were detained for unlawfully pointing lasers into federal officers’ eyes, the department said.

Federal officers called for help around 2 a.m. because people were resisting arrest and protesters in the crowd were throwing bottles at them, police said. The crowd eventually dispersed just before 3:30 a.m.

Demonstrations against police brutality and racism in Portland continued for the 45th consecutive day Saturday, according to the Oregonian.

Businesses in downtown Portland have suffered $23 million in damage and lost business amid weeks of nightly chaotic and violent protests, Portland Deputy Police Chief Chris Davis said last week during a virtual news briefing.

Stephanie Nolasco,'Families of the Mafia' star Karen Gravano explains why dad Sammy ‘The Bull’ is appearing on MTV reality show,"Sammy “The Bull” Gravano is getting ready for his close-up.

The former underboss for the Gambino crime family is appearing on the new MTV reality TV series “Families of the Mafia” with his daughter Karen Gravano and granddaughter Karina Seabrook.

The six-part docuseries, a remodel of “Made in Staten Island,” follows four neighboring mafia-related families for two years as they attempt to reshape their lives away from organized crime.

Gravano, now 75, was released early from federal prison in 2017 after serving most of a 20-year sentence for drug-related convictions in Arizona and New York. At the time, Arizona Department of Corrections officials said, Gravano was released from the state prison system the previous year but was incarcerated federally until then. Authorities said Gravano will be on federal parole for the rest of his life.

In the past, Gravano confessed to involvement in 19 murders. He later became a government informant in 1991 and helped bring down 39 mobsters, including the family’s boss John Gotti, by testifying against him.

Karen, 47, spoke to Fox News about what made her father say yes to reality TV, what life is like for the ex-mobster today, as well as what viewers (and critics) can expect from “Families of the Mafia.

Fox News: What made your father say yes to a reality TV show?

Karen Gravano: I had to cook him a lot of good meals *laughs*. You know, I think when he came home, he wanted to rebuild his relationship with my daughter. He pretty much spent most of her life in prison. And seeing that I’ve done shows and a book before, he supported me.

I also sat down with him and explained exactly what this is is going to be about. It’s not like he came out [of prison] and then wanted to do reality TV. We were filming and I was like, “You’re such a big part of my life, my story. This is who we are. Let’s share our experience with others.” Once I explained to him in that way he agreed and wanted to support me.

Fox News: What’s life like for your father today?

Gravano: You know, he’s finally taking it slowly one day at a time. He’s older now and did over 18 years in prison. So when he came back home, life was just so different. The world is so different. He had to see things in a new light, like telephones and social media. He’s keeping busy and working on his own projects, but he’s just taking it day-by-day and enjoying life.

Fox News: Is there anything about life in 2020 that has surprised him?

Gravano: He’s just amazed by social media and YouTube…. He’ll always say, “Don’t kids go outside and play kickball anymore?” When I was growing up, we would always have Sunday dinners at my grandparents’ house. That was mandatory. You couldn’t have any other plans. Spending time with your family was non-negotiable. You couldn’t just go upstairs and be in front of the computer while having dinner. Phones were never at the table. That’s completely different for him.

Fox News: Your daughter didn’t have much a relationship with your father, but it seems like things will change in the show.

Gravano: When I was growing up, my father and I had a great relationship. He was so involved in my life. I wanted my daughter Karina to experience that and know that about him. I wanted her to have more than just a 15-minute phone call or sitting across from him at a table with the guards sitting right next to us. I wanted her to build a relationship with my father and get to know him on a more personal level than just hear everything that the media has to say about him or even the good side of everything that I told her. I just wanted her to experience it and learn it for herself.

Fox News: Back when you were on “Mob Wives” your father wasn’t thrilled with the idea of you participating in a show like that. How have things changed since then?

Gravano: When we did “Mob Wives” it was such a new concept. Remember, I never even said the word “mob” in our household. It was such a secret society. It was something you never talked about in the household. So when we did “Mob Wives,” we were basically lifting the curtain.

And I remember so many people freaked out over that. There were a lot of fistfights in the show and my father never liked that. He would always say, “Gangsters would never act like that.” I would get that comment all the time *laughs*. But when he finally came home, I really got the chance to sit down with him and explain why I was doing this. And eventually, he got it. But he still says. “You know, this is different.” But I think at the end of the day, he would prefer me to do this than something else.

In the beginning, everyone was like “Oh my God, you’re going to dredge all this stuff up from the past.” But he learned that I embraced my past. I learned from our mistakes. This is who I am no matter what. People will always judge me because of my name. So instead of hiding from that, I want young people to learn from our mistakes and hopefully learn from it. Or maybe they will just see how important it is to have a relationship with your family. Some people still tell me, “How could you expose your daughter to your past?” But how could I not? At the end of the day, I want her to be better than me. Isn’t that what all parents want for their children? I want her to learn from my mistakes.

Fox News: You’ve been very candid about your family and your past. How are things for you today?

Gravano: I think things have leveled through. Reality TV has become a way of life for the last couple of years. I also have my own personal businesses, like [a] restaurant. I’m a hustler in a good sense. I love to keep pushing through and keep doing new things. Reality TV has been kind of a springboard for certain different projects. I’m just trying to do everything I can in a positive way and provide for my family.

Fox News: What are some misconceptions you feel people still have about your family?

Gravano: That we glorify this lifestyle. But the reality is that was our past. We’re just trying to learn from our mistakes. And I’m not scared to talk about it. This is what happened. I’m not afraid to say I screwed up. I don’t want the same mistakes to be made by other people, especially those I love and care about.

Fox News: Some critics still insist you’re making light of organized crime with reality TV. What would you tell them?

Gravano: Watch the show (laughs). I think there will always be critics, especially for me because of my father and the lifestyle I grew up in. But I’ve always said that my goal is to show you the struggles we went through as a family. My father, he spent all these years in prison. And his thing is that this is not a way for kids. This is not something that should be glorified and looked up to. It only leads to negative results at the end of the day. I can only speak for my family personally, but we’ve been through multiple kinds of situations. Yet we’ve remained a family unit. We’ve always had each other’s back no matter what. And that's what I think the critics should really be paying attention to. If you see the show, you’ll understand that.

And when you see the parents with their children, you can tell how badly they want them to be better. I don’t think you need to be from the mafia to relate to these stories. We’re all just trying to be better. I commend the other families for opening up. It’s easy to get one person on reality TV. But it’s completely different when there’s a whole family involved. But they just put all their walls down.

Julia Musto,Lawrence Jones: We need media to challenge Biden on his policies,"The media needs to challenge presumptive 2020 Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden on his progressive policies, Fox Nation host Lawrence Jones asserted Friday.

In an interview on ""Fox & Friends,"" Jones pointed out that the former vice president has been swayed farther and farther to the left as his party shifts towards the positions of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

TRUMP CLAIMS FAR LEFT 'BRAINWASHED' BIDEN IN 'HANNITY' EXCLUSIVE: 'HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HE IS DOING'

On Thursday, Biden unveiled his ""Build Back Better"" economic plan, which centered on manufacturing, innovation, and middle-class families--hallmarks of President Trump's ""America First"" platform.

""The truth is throughout this [coronavirus] crisis, Donald Trump has been almost singularly focused on the stock market — the Dow and Nasdaq — not you, not your families,"" Biden said. ""If I'm fortunate enough to be elected president, I'll be laser-focused on working families, the middle-class families that I came from.""

""Friends"" host Steve Doocy noted: ""You know, the Joe Biden camp says regarding his...plan that it's actually quite moderate because it does not cave completely to the radical left; because they didn't put the Green New Deal in it, they didn't put [in] Medicare-for-all, they didn't get rid of fracking in the United States. So, is it ultimately moderate or is it a tilt to the left?""

""No, it’s progressive,"" Lawrence replied.

""And, as I continue to tell people, Bernie Sanders is the most popular Democrat. He is the most powerful Democrat even though he is not really a Democrat. He wants incremental change. He wants generational change. He is not worried about being president,"" Jones said. ""And, as you can see Joe Biden is adopting policies that [are] associated with him.""

But the thing that worries Jones the most is that Biden's promises to the American electorate often seem contradictory.

""But, the thing that is concerning is that you have him releasing this proposal that is supposed to be this compromise to get those progressive voters because he needs them or they are not going to show up if he doesn't adopt something. And then, you have a speech of him talking about America first and putting American jobs first. And, it seems like a contradiction,"" he said. ""And so, this is why we need debates.

Andy Puzder,Andy Puzder: Signs of a 'V'-shaped recovery — a welcome bounce back in economy,"The early economic signs indicate that we may already be in a “V”-shaped recovery — or at the very least a strong checkmark-shaped recovery — as we cautiously emerge from the coronavirus shutdown.

As Federal Reserve Bank Chairman Jay Powell admitted earlier this week, we have experienced a welcome “bounce back in economic activity,” and “have done so sooner than expected.” The economic data from the past two months make the point.

The May jobs report gave us the first indication that the post-pandemic rebound would be something special, revealing that employers had created a record-shattering 2.5 million jobs in a single month, beating economists' expectations for a loss of around 9 million jobs.

SEN. RICK SCOTT: CORONAVIRUS MANDATES – AMERICANS WILL MAKE THE RIGHT DECISIONS IF GIVEN MORE INFORMATION

Most economists anticipated that the trend would continue, but few foresaw just how stellar the June jobs report turned out to be. Last month, the country gained a mind-boggling 4.8 million new jobs, blowing past consensus expectations of around 3.7 million. As an added bonus, last month’s total was revised upward by nearly 200,000 jobs, bring the two-month gain to 7.5 million jobs.

Even though the labor force participation rate rose sharply, meaning more people began looking for work, the nationwide unemployment rate nonetheless plummeted in June by more than two full percentage points, falling from 13.3 percent to 11.1 percent, also beating economists’ expectations of a 0.8 of a percentage point decrease to 12.5 percent.

Those are some incredible numbers! But what else were we seeing in the economy?

In May, retail sales increased by a record 17.7 percent, soundly beating economists’ expectations of around 8.4 percent. This increase in retail sales — following three months of declines — bodes well for a return to positive economic growth. Consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of our economic output, and retail sales account for about a quarter of consumer spending.

New home sales, a leading indicator of housing market health, were up 16.6 percent in May, beating economists’ expectations of a 1.9 percent increase — with many economists having forecasted negative sales in May.

The renaissance is taking place across the board as state and local officials roll back their lockdown orders.

The National Association of Realtors recently reported that its index of pending home sales, a forward-looking indicator based on contract signings, rebounded by a record-setting 44.3 percent in May, driving the index to 99.6, the highest month-over-month gain since its inception in January 2001.

So how about June? It’s obviously early, but we have some data in addition to the jobs numbers.

Manufacturing, which represents about 11 percent of the U.S. economy, saw a big positive jump in June for the second straight month. The Institute for Supply Manufacturing survey showed that 52.6 percent of companies said their businesses are growing, up from 43.1 percent in May. That’s the best score since April of 2019 — and, of course, it beat economists’ expectations of 49.5 percent.

Consumers saw the writing on the wall in June even if the economists missed it — again. The Conference Board, a New York-based research organization, said that its Consumer Confidence Index rose to 98.1 in June from 85.9 in May, the biggest jump since 2011 and beating economists’ expectations of 90.5.

Not wanting to miss out on all the positivity, the stock markets — which are forward-looking — closed up nearly 20 percent for the quarter ending June 30, their best quarterly percentage increase since 1998.

Bottom line: the economic improvements over the past two months have been tremendous.

The renaissance is taking place across the board as state and local officials roll back their lockdown orders, though the gains are naturally being led by industries that were hit hardest by the pandemic, including leisure and hospitality (2.1 million new jobs), retail (740,000 new jobs), education and health services (568,000 new jobs), and manufacturing (356,000 new jobs).

There are plenty of lockdown orders still in place all over the country, meaning we’ve got ample potential for additional growth just by continuing to responsibly return to normal, even if we occasionally need to douse the embers of the pandemic here and there.

This unprecedented “V”-shaped recovery is exactly what President Trump predicted at the height of the COVID-19 downturn. Based on his track record of presiding over record-setting economic prosperity before the foreign pandemic reached our shores, I’ve always had confidence in the president’s ability to guide us through this crisis.

Now that the bounce-back has begun, I’m excited to see how his pro-growth economic agenda of middle-income tax cuts, targeted deregulation and genuinely free trade will fuel our national resurgence.

The “V”-shaped economic recovery has only just begun, and while there may be some coronavirus flare-ups along the way that force us to slow things down, we’ll have nothing to worry about as long as we keep President Trump’s pro-growth economic policies in place.

Yael Halon,Real estate CEO predicts future of remote working in NYC: 'Maybe workers go in once or twice a week',"Real estate entrepreneur Don Peebles predicted on ""Your World"" Monday that New York City-based companies are likely to reduce brick-and-mortar office space in favor of remote working, dealing a further blow to a market reeling from the coronavirus pandemic.

""Office space consumption was already on the decline,"" Peebles told host Neil Cavuto.

CORONAVIRUS LEADS TO NYC REAL ESTATE POUNDING

""What happened with COVID-19 is, it accelerated nationally ... because it compelled most Americans, certainly office workers, to work remotely. What business owners, entrepreneurs, and CEOs found out is that it was an effective way to work.""

Approximately 300,000 New Yorkers returned to work Monday as the city moved to Phase 2 of its reopening strategy, but Peebles said it would be only a matter of time before employees see a ""significant decline"" in office space.

""Now people can work from all over the world and they don't have to be in the same geographic location of where their job is located,"" he explained. ""That will open up [a] greater talent pool for businesses to make it more cost-effective.

""I think that there is a difference coming and the CEOs who are questioning that are right on point,"" he added.

While experts were hopeful that the real estate market would bounce back as the city moved toward a full reopening, Peebles said many are now hesitant to return due to a troubling uptick in violent crime and murder rates in recent weeks.

Talia Kaplan,Arizona gym CEO details fight to stay open during coronavirus pandemic,"The CEO of an Arizona fitness club company told “Fox & Friends Weekend” on Sunday that he feels “singled out” and is suing Gov. Doug Ducey over what he calls an “arbitrary” decision to re-close gyms as coronavirus cases surge.

“The decision was just arbitrary, there was no fact behind the decision,” Mountainside Fitness CEO Tom Hatten said the day before he was scheduled to appear in court.

He added that he received no warning and the decision to close gyms wasn’t consistent with “the previous mandate for everybody to close down.”

“We just felt like it was unconstitutional when you can make arbitrary decisions like that,” he continued, adding that there were “statutes in our Arizona law that [don’t] allow for that and that’s where our basis of our case is as we look tomorrow for a stay.”

Mountainside’s nearly 20 locations were closed for two months following the Republican governor’s mandate. The company reported it received no governmental assistance.

Last week, Ducey ordered the closure of bars, gyms, movie theaters, nightclubs and water parks across the state for 30 days in an effort to combat the spike in coronavirus cases.

Most bars and nightclubs reopened after Ducey let stay-at-home and business closures expire in May. Bars that didn’t serve food were allowed to reopen, a loophole that led to packed venues and almost no way to practice social distancing, The Associated Press reported.

When asked what he was doing to keep gym-goers safe, Hatten said, “Everything that we can possibly do.”

“Before we had opened up, we had worked closely with the governor’s office to write the protocols that we put in place for when we did open,” he continued, adding that “that’s part of the frustration.”

He explained, “We were following the protocols perfectly, from all the cleaning that we’ve been doing, to social distancing, to taking temperatures of the employees, washing hands every 30 minutes. I can go on and on.”

Hatten added, “We were fully in compliance with everything that we had been working with them to do to open.”

When asked what he would say to critics arguing that more businesses should be shutting down rather than opening up Hatten said, “I definitely agree.”

“This isn’t about the science of COVID,” he continued. “We all understand, here in Arizona, the problem with the number of positive cases growing. This is about the arbitrary nature of the decision of our governor.”

He went on, “It really starts to look into, if it’s our business, what’s the reason, what’s the facts behind this particular business, why not the other 99 percent of businesses that are open? Why are those left open and why are we singled out and closed?”

Hatten continued, “We feel strongly, if the numbers are true, then let’s step back and take a unilateral approach to everything here in Arizona, not just fitness centers.”

Ducey did not immediately respond to Fox News’ request for comment.

Mike Maceacheran,Sealand: A peculiar ‘nation’ off England’s coast,"This story starts with an email that I will never forget.

On a late spring morning in mid-May, Prince Michael of Sealand, leader of a micronation called the Principality of Sealand, messaged me with five clear-cut words: “You can speak to me”.

It was a peculiarly short prologue to a barely believable story that would take me on a historical journey through the realms of self-proclaimed kings, territorial claims, historical anomalies and World War Britain. And, as unlikely as it sounds, pirate radio stations and cockle fishing, too.

Another fact about this exchange: it thrilled me. I’d never received an email from a prince before, and it was unlikely to ever happen again.

Of course, I’d come across the story of Sealand, a tiny principality off the English coast of Suffolk that claims to be the world’s smallest country, before. The micronation, in fact a solitary World War Two-era anti-aircraft platform, was first erected in 1942 as HM Fort Roughs, an armed sea fort outside of Britain's then territorial limit in the North Sea. From being occupied by up to 300 Royal Navy personnel at the height of the war to its final evacuation in 1956, the gun station was soon abandoned and left to fall into disrepair. That is, until 1966, when a former British Army major occupied it, giving birth to a new, tiny micronation.

I certainly didn’t think it’d be a story that’d carry on for 50-odd years

Today, it remains 12km offshore, visible up close only by boat. To look at, it is nothing special: a blasted-looking platform with a smattering of container-like buildings on top. To disembark requires braving whipping winds and moshing waves while being winched up by a crane.

But there was plenty more I didn’t know. Stories about dawn helicopter raids for one. Others about devious gangsters and an attempted coup by shady European businessmen. Even a revelation from a declassified UK government document describing the frontier as a “Cuba off the east coast of England”.

It all sounded like the plot to a B-movie, born from the pen of a Hollywood scriptwriter. Not from the determination of a working-class family from Essex who turned this outpost into a micronation. And yet here, in this lonely North Sea spot, dreams were born, freedom from authority was granted and British eccentricity — in all its pomp and pageant — ruled.

• The tiny 'country' between England and Scotland

• Europe's strange border anomaly

• The 'nation' with a useless passport

Four days later, Prince Michael of Sealand answered my call. The micronation leader was armed with riveting tales, many of which appear in his memoir, Holding The Fort. And he was ready to divulge Sealand’s story, which largely remains unknown by the rest of the world.

“I was only 14 when I first came out during my school summer holidays to help my dad, and I thought it’d only be a six-week adventure,” he said, speaking from his main home, a bungalow on the Essex coast. “I certainly didn’t think it’d be a story that’d carry on for 50-odd years. It was a strange upbringing, as sometimes we stayed for months on end, waiting for the boat to bring supplies from the mainland. I’d look out at the horizon and all I could see from morning to night was the North Sea.”

Such nostalgia of a place shouldn’t dilute the complexities of Sealand’s contested geopolitical circumstances. No country formally recognises Sealand, even if Prince Michael says the micronation has never asked for recognition.

“We don’t expect any either,” he added, bluntly. “Remember, the platform was built illegally outside British territorial waters during a time of war – but everyone was too busy to care. The British should have destroyed it when they had the chance, but they never got ‘round to it. Now, decades later, Sealand is still here.”

By virtue of their size – just 0.004 sq km in Sealand’s case – micronations require us to reset our sense of scale. But what draws people to creating their own in the first place? For George Dunford, co-author of Micronations: The Lonely Planet Guide to Home-Made Nations, it’s a dissatisfaction with their current government and “wanting to do things their own way”.

“Sealand is a special case because it has got away with it for so long and ducked laws,” said Dunford. “In the United States, the family would have been seen as dissidents, but the UK was a more tolerant place back in the 1960s – and bureaucrats probably thought it more trouble than it was worth to tackle the problem. They had a few tries and there were takeover attempts, but it survived. It’s a real survivor of the micronations community.”

As a rule, most micronations trace their de facto recognition back to 1933 when the Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States was signed by international leaders, including then US President Franklin D Roosevelt. In it, the legislation sets out four main criteria for statehood.

“The Montevideo Convention is mostly commonly used to define a micronation, which calls for a population, territory, government and relations with other states,” Dunford explained. “It’s the last one that makes micronations most agitational because they often try to provoke other states into recognising them. Sealand eschews it by saying it’s a sovereign state with its own ruler.”

The British should have destroyed it when they had the chance, but they never got round to it

Every nation has a convoluted origin story and Sealand’s is more Kafkaesque than most. It begins in 1965 when Prince Michael’s father, Paddy Roy Bates, a former British Army major turned fisherman, began Radio Essex. This pirate radio station was located offshore on Knock John, another disused naval fort near HM Fort Roughs. Such was the popularity of the illegal offshore stations at the time, the UK government then rolled out the Marine Broadcasting Offences Act of 1967. It had one purpose: to shut them all down.

Seeing an opportunity, Bates moved his operation onto HM Fort Roughs — further out to sea and, and more importantly, further into contested international waters. Like Knock John, it was tenantless and in a state of disrepair – and, whether legal or not, Bates assumed control of the outpost on Christmas Eve 1966. Nine months later, on 2 September 1967, he declared it the Principality of Sealand – a romantic gesture on his wife Joan’s birthday. Shortly after, the entire family moved in.

At its peak, in the early 1970s, Sealand had 50 people living on the platform, including extended family and friends and maintenance personnel. At the same time, it became an unlikely symbol of anti-authority protests in the UK; but behind the scenes, the bohemian operation was run on a far more basic level.

“Nothing worked,” Prince Michael told me. “We started with candles then upgraded to hurricane lamps and pump-up generators. The good thing was it is as dry as a boat; if you didn’t know you were out at sea you could never tell. I spent years and years out there – but, you know, it was home.”

Ever since, the rogue state has embraced nationhood. It introduced its own coat of arms and constitution. There’s a flag, football team and anthem, while the currency bears the portrait of “Princess Joan” and around 500 passports have been issued. The motto of the micronation, over which Prince Michael and his three children (James, Liam and Charlotte) and second wife (Mei Shi, a former major in the Chinese People’s Liberation Army) continue the Sealand dynasty, reflects a love of unshackled independence. “E Mare, Libertas” it reads. Or, “From the sea, freedom”.

“My father never set out to start his own country,” explained Prince Michael, who is also owner of a cockle fishing business that exports seafood to Spain. “He was principally offended by the UK government wanting to close his pirate radio station. And ever since, we’ve fought the British government all the way – and won. Sealand still maintains its independence.”

By any measure, the most controversial episode in Sealand’s history took place in 1978. Buoyed by thoughts of an international takeover, a group of German and Dutch mercenaries stormed Sealand one August night, only to be captured at gunpoint by the Bates family and held hostage.

“It led to the German ambassador and an official delegation coming from the embassy in London by helicopter to hold negotiations for his release,” Prince Michael said nonchalantly, playing down the drama of the incident. “So, by negotiating, they in fact gave us de facto recognition.”

In the United States, the family would have been seen as dissidents

What’s not up for debate is that independence doesn’t come cheap. To fund Sealand’s operational costs – including two full-time security personnel who live on the micronation year-round – Sealand’s online store sells T-shirts, stamps and royal titles. A Lord, Lady, Baron or Baroness peerage costs £29.99.

The usual customs and immigration norms don’t apply either, of course. It’s only possible to visit with an official invitation from the prince, who visits two to three times a year, and beyond the shoestring staff, no-one currently lives here.

“Sealand has always teetered on being precarious, but the current prince runs the place on more of an even keel these days,” said Dunford. “That’s what I love about micronations. The way they parody the pomp of real nationalism is fabulous.” As a case in point, Sealand receives in excess of 100 emails a day, with requests from wannabe citizens from Delhi to Tokyo keen to pledge allegiance to the flag.

“Our story still fires people up,” Prince Michael concluded. “We don’t live in a society where people like being told what to do, and everybody loves the idea of liberty and freedom from government. The world needs inspiring territories like us – and there aren’t many places like this that exist.”

In Bates’ life, one thing has remained reassuringly constant: Sealand still stands tall, watching silently over the North Sea. For the rest of us, it is a curious place so near to the UK and yet so far – an elsewhere of this world so extraordinary and different that it almost feels impossible.

Lu-Hai Liang,Why email loses out to popular apps in China,"But in China, it’s a different picture. Deloitte’s 2018 China Mobile Consumer Survey showed that Chinese people checked their email 22% less than users globally. Instead WeChat is dominant; some 79.1% of smartphone owners are regular users of the app, while 84.5% of people who use messaging apps in China use WeChat. And that preference extends into the office: the 2017 WeChat user behaviour report compiled by Penguin Intelligence, a research arm of Tencent (which created WeChat), found that almost 88% of 20,000 people surveyed used WeChat in their daily work communication. Phones, SMS and fax were used by 59.5%. Email was a distant third on 22.6%.



Eva Hsu, who runs a digital branding business, is Taiwanese and spent some of her youth living in the US. She’s been working in Shanghai for six years. For her foreign clients, Hsu says she communicates via email and LinkedIn, but for her Chinese clients it’s a different story. “Chinese clients tend to use WeChat and send files on WeChat as the main way of communication,” she says.

Late adopters



With over a billion users in China, WeChat is a super app that is ubiquitous. But the reasons why Chinese people prefer communicating over a platform such as WeChat may have been formed years earlier. In 1999, newly-established Chinese technology company Tencent released a product called QQ, based on the popular desktop instant messaging programme ICQ, which was owned by AOL.



At the time, there were only 1.2 computers per 100 people in China, according to the World Bank. By contrast, there was one computer for every two people in the United States. But as the 2000s progressed internet cafes sprang up across China and were quickly embraced by young people. QQ became a key reason for the cafes’ popularity, as it provided entertainment with features such as games, music and an early Chinese social network where people could post micro-blogs. Compared to email, QQ offered more interaction, with the ability to create avatars, for example, and instant messaging.",2020-07-07,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200707-why-email-loses-out-to-popular-apps-in-china
Emily Mcauliffe,Is rum about to become the new gin?,"Image copyright Alison George Image caption Mark Watkins makes award-winning rum in Australia

Rum distiller Mark Watkins is reflecting on his disastrous first attempt at making his own spirits when he was a teenager.

The then 16-year-old had set up a rudimentary distillery at the back of his parents' banana farm in the small town of Walkamin, in north-eastern Queensland, Australia.

His questionable safety standards nearly saw the family's crop go up in flames, and he almost poisoned his school friend.

""He's still alive, but he doesn't talk to me anymore,"" says Mr Watkins, now 39.

Nevertheless, this stumble out of the starting blocks left him unperturbed. He was on a mission to make top-quality spirits, with the ultimate goal of creating the best rum in the world. Two decades later, he's accomplished his mission.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Rum can be drunk neat, with a mixer, or as the base for numerous cocktails

Last year, the World Rum Awards named Mr Watkins' Iridium rum ""the world's best pot still rum, five years old and under"". It put his small business, Mt Uncle Distillery, on the global map.

Although the company is a tiny drop in the global spirits pool, Mt Uncle is one of a small but growing number of rum distilleries around the world taking the spirit in a new direction - low volume, premium production.

So, is rum now starting to follow the path set by gin over the past decade, which has seen a huge rise in the number of independent producers as demand has soared?

But first a reminder - what exactly is rum? It is a spirit made from distilling sugarcane juice, sugar cane syrup (concentrated juice), or sugarcane molasses, which is the thick, dark treacle you are left with after granulated sugar has been produced. It can be drunk neat, with water, a mixer or as a cocktail base.

A brief history of rum

Rum is synonymous with the Caribbean, where the first modern rums were distilled on sugarcane plantations in the 17th Century

The history of the spirit is intrinsically linked to slavery, as it was slaves working on the plantations who discovered that molasses, the dark treacle left over after sugar has been refined, could be fermented and then distilled into a spirit

Rum also became associated with the British Royal Navy, with sailors being given a daily ""rum ration"" from 1850 until the practice was ended in 1970. A type of dark rum called ""navy rum"" is still made and sold by a number of producers

Today the world's largest exporter of rum in value terms is the US ($159m in 2018), followed by Germany ($150m), Italy ($142m), Cuba and the Dominican Republic (both $105m) and Guatemala ($98m)

Assessed in its entirety, global rum production - which is dominated by mass market brands produced in huge volumes - has flat-lined in recent years.

Total worldwide sales by volume of standard or value-priced rum grew just 0.6% from 2014 to 2019, according to the latest figures from research group IWSR Drinks Market Analysis.

Yet at the same time, ""high-end rum"" bottles costing $28 (£22.50) or above grew by 8.3% over the same period, says the organisation.

""I think, in general, new generations of [rum drinkers] are drinking less, but they're drinking better,"" says Roberto Serralles, a sixth-generation rum-maker. His family own and run Puerto Rican business Destileria Serralles, which has been making rum since 1865.

""The rum category is heavily weighted at the lower end, so the higher premium end is growing, but with small volume, and that's why it gets lost.""

Many rum aficionados, like Mr Watkins, say that rum still has an inferior image, purveyed by cheap brands, and often, their subsequent hangovers.

""Lots of people got smashed on rum when they were 17, and haven't given it another chance,"" says the Australian. ""Lots of people are familiar with cheaper brands, and [for small distilleries] it can be a hard game to crack into, as there are so many big multinational companies involved.""

Image copyright Don Q Image caption Roberto Serralles's family has been making rum for 155 years

Rum consultant, and World Rum Awards chair of judges, Peter Holland agrees that the rum industry has some repositioning to do. ""A problem that we have in the rum world is that it's represented invariably by price, and that price is low,"" he says. ""When you race to the bottom you're not really driving up quality.""

Thus, Mr Holland's passion lies in re-educating the market about rum. He feels it is a spirit that has enormous potential, and a level of complexity - attained through different distillation and aging techniques - that is currently not well marketed or understood.

As Queensland is a big grower of sugar cane, Mt Uncle has a ready source of sugar syrup from which to make its rum. In fact, Mr Watkins' family farm in Walkamin, which is home to Mt Uncle Distillery, is right next to a sugar mill.

For rum producers in cooler countries where sugarcane cannot be grown, they typically rely on easily transportable and readily available molasses. This is the case at the UK's Two Drifters Rum.

Located outside the city of Exeter in the south west of England, the company is run by husband and wife team Russ and Gemma Wakeham.

They started out making beer in 2019, with a small distillery on the side ""for a bit of fun"" but have now switched to solely making rum.

""It was completely driven by the fact that we couldn't make enough of it,"" says Russ.

Image copyright Matt Austin Image caption Russ and Gemma Wakeham have now been making rum in England for a year

The company buys its molasses from UK sugar producers including Tate & Lyle. It now produces a range of rums, with the spiced version being the bestseller - though Mr Wakeham admits that purists would not see spiced rum as a true representation of the spirit.

Mr Holland says that if rum wants to cement its move upmarket, the industry should stop categorising the drink by its colour.

""Colour is not a flavour,"" he says. ""I think white, gold and dark are very disingenuous terms to categorise a very diverse market.

""You don't order gold whisky or dark cognac, so why should rum be tarred with that brush? If we can make the language around rum a bit more grown up, then I think we have a better chance of bringing people over [to the rum market].""

Mr Serralles says the industry also needs to better educate drinkers. ""Most people don't know what to do with rum.

""They've usually always thought of it as something you drink with Coke, or with an umbrella on vacation.""

Image copyright Alison George Image caption Mark Watkins says rum could be the next fashionable spirit

With global rum sales totalling $16.5bn in 2019, according to the IWSR, it trails far behind vodka ($43.6bn) and whiskies ($74bn), but is still ahead of gin ($10.8bn).

So is rum really about to mirror gin's huge growth in sales, and see a significant rise in the number of small producers as it surges in popularity?

""That's the question on everyone's lips,"" says Mr Watkins. ""I think rum could be the next boom spirit. It's definitely due for it.""",2020-07-12,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-53320176
Jonathan Josephs,"Coronavirus: Emirates set to cut 9,000 jobs, citing pandemic","Image caption Emirates president Sir Tim Clark

The president of Emirates said the Middle Eastern airline is set to cut as many as 9,000 jobs because of the coronavirus pandemic.

It is the first time the world's biggest long-haul carrier has disclosed how many jobs will be lost.

Prior to the crisis, Emirates had 60,000 staff.

Sir Tim Clark said the airline had already cut a tenth of its staff but said: ""We will probably have to let go of a few more, probably up to 15%.""

The global airline industry has been severely impacted by coronavirus, with activity all but grinding to a halt.

In an interview with the BBC, Sir Tim said Emirates was ""not as badly off as others"".

But its current situation marks a steep turnaround in the fortunes of the airline, which he said before the pandemic was ""heading for one of our best years ever"".

The job cuts sweeping the wider aviation industry are fuelling concern amongst Emirates staff that things might get worse.

The BBC understands there is growing frustration at what they see as poor communications and transparency from the airline.

At least 700 of the airline's 4,500 pilots were given redundancy notices this week, which means at least 1,200 have been told their jobs are going since the coronavirus crisis started.

Image copyright Reuters

The cuts have been focused on those who fly Airbus planes, rather than Boeing aircraft.

Emirates flies superjumbo Airbus A380s which hold around 500 passengers. Whereas the Boeing 777s it flies hold fewer passengers and are therefore easier to fill during this period of decreased airline travel.

00Thousands of cabin crew have also been told they are no longer needed.

Further cuts

The International Air Transport Association, which represents 290 airlines, is forecasting that the world's airlines will lose more than $84bn and one million jobs this year.

This week United Airlines, one of the big three in the US, warned its staff that it may have to cut 36,000 staff because of the huge fall in demand for air travel.

Helane Becker, managing director and senior research analyst at investment firm Cowen said given ""the continuing issues surrounding the pandemic"" she expects US airlines to cull up to 200,000 of their 750,000 staff this year.

US aviation unions are pushing the federal government to add to the $25bn bailout package it has provided so far.

As part of the conditions for receiving state help, airlines have to protect jobs until the end of September.

But IATA says there are wider benefits in doing so.

A spokesman said the scale of job cuts in the aviation sector ""shows the severe economic crisis facing the industry and all who depend on air connectivity"".

Adding that its perfectly understandable that governments have put restrictions in place to try and keep people safe from coronavirus ""but this should be done in the full knowledge of the economic and social consequences"".

Kevin Peachey,Coronavirus: Package holiday firms told to sharpen up on refunds,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Resorts are now welcoming back British tourists

More than 100 holiday companies have been told to speed up their refunds policy for coronavirus cancellations.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has received more than 17,500 complaints from people whose holidays have been hit by the virus.

In an open letter from the CMA, companies have been reminded of the 14-day refund rule for cancellations.

Travel firms say this has been an unprecedented crisis that put many of them on the brink of collapse.

Consumers' rights

By law, if a package holiday is cancelled by the provider, then a refund should be provided for the whole holiday within 14 days.

Many thousands of getaways were cancelled during lockdown, when the Foreign Office advised against all but essential travel outside of the UK.

The CMA said its investigations found that some businesses may not have been giving these legally-required refunds.

Other problems included:

Holidaymakers only being offered a voucher for future travel, rather than a full refund

Customers losing their deposits or being charged cancellation fees

Companies misleading customers about their rights

People finding it difficult to contact travel companies or to claim refunds

In the letter, CMA director Cecilia Parker Aranha said the regulator recognised the ""extraordinary pressures"" faced by the sector.

""Although we were sympathetic to the challenges faced in the early days of the pandemic, it is nonetheless important that businesses comply with consumer law,"" she added.

A spokeswoman for Abta, which represents the package holiday sector, said the pressures were continuing and that many companies, with loyal customers, had mutually agreed to a rebooked holiday rather than a refund.

She said Abta had conducted its own investigations of members when customers had been misled.

However, she added that package holiday companies were themselves facing delays from airlines in refunding them the flight element of any holiday.

""Many airlines, in particular, have been and continue to be very slow in passing refunds back to package holiday businesses, which means that those package holiday businesses are unable to refund their customers as promptly as they would wish,"" she said.

""It is essential, therefore, that effective regulatory action is taken against the airlines that are not currently refunding with seven days, as required under relevant consumer protection legislation.""

Airlines are regulated by the Civil Aviation Authority which has been putting pressure on companies to comply.

Jessica Bateman,The young people fighting the worst smog in Europe,"“We always knew there was a problem with pollution because we can see it,” says Kosta Barsov, who lives in Skopje, North Macedonia. “In winter it stinks – if I open my bedroom window while I’m studying it feels like I’m suffocating. If I go walk my dog, I have to change my clothes when I get back because they smell.

Every day in winter, 16-year-old Barsov opens the AirCare app on his phone and checks the pollution levels around him. “There are two sensors close to my house and it’s always really polluted in winter,” Barsov tells me. If he sees a green circle, the air around him is reasonably clean. If it’s yellow, there’s some pollution but it doesn’t break EU limits. If it’s red or darker, pollution is over the limit, and hazardous to health.

The app has become an essential tool to Barsov, and many others in the city, for understanding where the pollution is and exactly how bad it is. As a result, it has sparked growing awareness, and concern, about the city’s air.

“A lot of people use the app, my uncle has asthma and he’s always checking it,” says Barsov, who is a member of the local Fridays for Future chapter, a global youth movement for action on climate change. “There’s been a lot more awareness over the past few years, and I feel we’re building a movement.”

While North Macedonia is not part of the EU, it has entered accession negotiations and has some way to go to meet EU air quality standards. At present, the World Health Organization has estimated that around 4,000 premature deaths a year in North Macedonia may be due to air pollution, and the economic cost to Skopje is thought to be between €570 and €1,470 million.",2020-07-01,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200701-skopje-north-macedonia-the-most-polluted-city-in-europe
Hope Ngo,How Hong Kong cleaned up its toxic harbour,"From the 1970s and well into the early 2000s, Hong Kong’s Victoria Harbour reeked. Unprecedented growth might have turned the territory – whose name ironically translates into English as “Fragrant Harbour” – into an economic tiger, but a growing population, as well as industrial and agricultural expansion, transformed its harbour into a cesspool.

It was filled with human excrement and effluent from farms that raised pigs and chickens, as well as untreated water loaded with chemicals and metals from textile and metal-plating industries located in the New Territories. Tests would show that the water had high levels of coliform bacteria, including E. coli, an indication of pollution due to faecal contamination, which made the water a health hazard.

In 1989, the government revealed in a policy paper that of the two million tonnes of sewage and industrial wastewater generated by Hong Kong every day, just 10% received some kind of biological treatment; 40% received partial treatment and was released through submarine pipes extending tens of metres beyond the seawall. The remaining 50% went straight into the sea, close to shore, with no treatment of any kind. Many areas in the territory were also developed without proper sewage mains, and four in five sewage treatment facilities didn’t meet required standards.

Virendra Anand lived on a boat in the Causeway Bay Typhoon Shelter from 1991 to 1993. “Back then, those of us who had boats never needed anti-fouling, which would normally be needed every two to three years to prevent barnacles from sticking to the hull,” says Anand, whose company was involved in what would become the Harbour Area Treatment Scheme. “The joke was that nothing stuck to the boat because we were floating on sewage.”

The 1989 paper would eventually form the basis for an ambitious, three-stage system where sewage would be collected from different parts of Hong Kong and sent back to a proposed treatment plant to be built on Stonecutter’s Island, on the western side of Victoria Harbour.

But it was a controversial project. China claimed the disposal scheme, due to cost $1.55bn at the time, was too expensive and would have a negative impact on the marine environment in the Pearl River Delta. Some local environmentalists said the treatment didn’t go far enough, and that it was dangerous to send partially treated effluent back into the sea. But China’s opposition also triggered concern from conservationists like Joanna Ruxton, who were worried that the project would stall after the 1997 handover, because the perception at the time was that China would not prioritise environmental protection.",2020-06-29,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200629-the-toxic-past-of-hong-kongs-iconic-victoria-harbour
Stav Dimitropoulos,Why Hollywood needs computer games tech more than ever,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The technology used in computer games is changing the way films are made, says Kim Libreri

Kim Libreri, an award-winning visual effects artist based in Northern California, has worked on movies including Artificial Intelligence and War of the Planet of the Apes.

For nine years he has been working with a piece of technology better known for computer games, in particular the smash-hit Fortnite.

The Unreal Engine, owned by Epic Games, provides the building blocks and tools that a computer game developer needs, but is increasingly an attractive technology for TV and film producers.

The latest version of technology, Unreal Engine 5, is coming out next year, and Epic has been heavily trailing its features.

It should allow visual effects artists like Mr Libreri to slot graphics and images straight into a scene, with little fuss.

""With traditional filmmaking, a director and cinematographer might shoot a scene on set -then down the line, hand footage and creative direction off to a team of virtual reality artists and designers, who enhance that material with visual effects and computer-generated imagery in a separate phase of production, says Mr Libreri, who is now chief technology officer at Epic Games.

Image copyright Epic Games Image caption Directors can play with lighting and other effects inside a games engine

With Unreal Engine collaboration between the director, cinematographer, production designer and virtual reality teams can occur simultaneously as an interactive process on set.

""Unreal Engine 5 promises to further free the artistic process by making it easier to take virtual worlds developed for feature film and television, and run them in the game engine in real time,"" says Mr Libreri.

Anthony Hunt, is the chief executive of Cinesite, a multinational digital entertainment group, whose visual effects film work includes blockbusters such as Avengers: Endgame, Independence Day: Resurgence, Iron Man 3 and more.

More Technology of Business

His company recently used Unreal Engine on a live stunt show for a theme park, which includes chase scenes, punishing fistfights, and death-defying leaps.

""It all happens right in front of you with live performers, interactive props and an immense LED screen - making it impossible to determine where the live-action ends and the screen begins,"" says Mr Hunt.

The film industry has long borrowed tech from the computer games industry.

Games production processes like mapping out scenes in 3D through photography, storyboards and animatics run on similar systems to those used to build games.

But the challenges of producing films and television under lockdown restrictions is likely to accelerate the use of games technology.

Image copyright PARAMOUNT PICTURES Image caption Dodger Stadium was recreated for Rocketman

For example game engines are particularly good for generating big crowd scenes.

""An extra has to be fed and clothed and housed on a film set. We can replicate huge crowd scenes with computer technology now and just have our main actors in the foreground,"" says Mr Hunt.

A good example of this a scene in Rocketman, the musical fantasy about Elton John's breakthrough years.

One scene was set in Dodger Stadium, but in reality actor Taron Egerton performed the scene at Shepperton Studios. The crowds used were 3D graphics designed to be parts of a larger scene.

Computer-generated scenery can be combined with LED walls - giant screens made up of individual displays.

""LED walls are becoming more popular in film and television production because they allow filmmakers to capture visual effects in camera, and manipulate digital objects in a scene in real time,"" says Mr Libreri.

""LED panels as those we've seen with Disney's The Mandalorian (a science fiction TV series and part of the Star Wars family) will be a huge benefit to on-set production once restrictions start to lift, as filmmakers can reduce travel by creating photorealistic digital backgrounds to mimic any location,"" he continues.

Image copyright Disney/Lucasfilms Image caption Disney's Mandalorian used a games engine and LED walls

""When the physical filming restrictions are lifted, directors will have a clear plan of what and how to shoot their film/TV series because they will have done so in the computer already,"" says Mr Hunt.

What will all this mean to the actors, crew and support staff who work in the industry?

""There is a possibility that production crew needs will alter somewhat. Some roles may change with the ongoing use of CGI, perhaps other roles will be created,"" Daniel Green, director of the Master of Entertainment Industry Management Program at Carnegie Mellon University says.

When production returns to normal, the industry will need to be unified and make changes to assure that safety is paramount says Dr Green.

Studio executives and producers will no longer be making decisions solely based on artistic vision and production costs.

""They will now be in close consultation with public health officials to make sure that crews, actors, and staff can have a work environment that is safe and secure,"" he says.

Mr Green also points out that CGI creates realistic worlds which are fun, but good story-telling is still the key.

""The use of CGI and virtual production as in The Lion King remake can augment what can be shown on the screen, but at the end of the day, audiences are still going to want to be entertained by a story that captivates them.""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption James Dean on the set of Giant

Travis Cloyd, chief technology officer of CMG Worldwide, a company that represents 1,700 celebrities, athletes, musicians, brands and historical figures, sees another use for games engines.

A great business opportunity lies in ""resurrecting"" historical figures and famous people of the past like James Dean or Rosa Parks via digital twins, according to Mr Cloyd.

""These famous people have a prebuilt awareness,"" he says. ""They will always resonate with the audiences and the expansion of new platforms amidst the pandemic will bring new opportunities to use them in a plethora of media,"" Mr Cloyd says.

Technology like the Unreal Engine is likely to be used in that process.

Movie making is of course a business, so the hope will be that new technology will save time and money.

""Fewer things will need to be worked out on set and in post-production, and there will be less need for travel and expensive location shoots,"" says Mr Libreri.

""Once people experience this new way of working,"" Mr Libreri continues, ""they will find that it is much more efficient and cost-effective"".

""It is safe to say that virtual production is here to stay,"" he says.",2020-07-12,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51799504
Andrea Marechal Watson,Beautiful homes for extended families,"The problem is particularly acute in the UK where escalating house prices have resulted in the rise of the boomerang generation – kids who come back to the family nest for economic reasons. In addition to the boomerangs – many of them graduates paying off student loans – we have the stickarounds, children living at home well into their 30s because it is the only chance of scraping together a deposit to buy a home of their own. And on top of this lot are separated or divorced families, as well as a rising tide of grannies and grandads. New research from investment broker Charles Stanley finds the desire to avoid escalating retirement or care-home costs is driving this trend.

There is however only so much space below stairs and under rooves that the typical home can make available to all these extra residents, so it comes as little surprise that a survey by Propertyheads.com found that interest in the ‘granny annexe’ has increased. According to the site: “After analysing the results of over 3,000 searches conducted during March and April 2020, some interesting patterns emerged which show how buyer behaviour has already started to change ahead of the easing of lockdown restrictions. The results revealed that searches for granny annexes were up by 16%, suggesting that the forced separation from older parents has made many realise that having them close by and ideally in a building attached to the same property is now a key factor in future property purchases.”

But what is really needed are not annexes but a fundamental rethink of housing and planning, and it is already happening across Europe and the US. In Germany, projects include the Mehrgenerationhaus (multi-generation house) programme, while Holland’s government has set a goal of creating 500,000 multi-generational homes by 2040. Initiatives in the UK include the Don’t Move Improve scheme and Superbia, a strategy to increase housing by using overlooked small sites such as gardens and rooftops in London’s suburban areas. There are an estimated four million gap sites (existing spaces between terraces or large gardens) in London alone.",2020-07-06,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20200706-beautiful-homes-for-extended-families
Jane Wakefield,Coronavirus: How can we make post-pandemic cities smarter?,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The so-called anthropause has given us time to think again about what we want from our cities

Streets have been eerily quiet in recent months as coronavirus lockdowns imposed by governments around the world hit the pause button on normal life.

And while many people have missed the shops and cafes, many have also appreciated the temporary respite from noise, pollution and congestion.

As cities start to wake up from the so-called anthropause, questions are being being asked about how we can improve them more permanently.

And the assumptions we had about making our cities smart may also need a rethink.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Drones have come of age in the pandemic as a means of delivering supplies and medicines without much human involvement

Robots and drones have certainly come into their own during the global lockdown.

The Boston Dynamics Spot robot has been used to help enforce social distancing in Singapore, while drone regulation has been fast-tracked in North Carolina to allow Zipline to deliver medical supplies to hospitals and telepresence robots have helped connect people in quarantine.

Daniela Rus is head of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and her lab designed a disinfectant robot, which is being used to clean Boston's food bank.

She told the BBC that robots have made a ""tremendous contribution"" during the pandemic. ""They have helped keep people out of harm's way and that is very powerful.""

In future, she sees them taking on a wider role in smart cities ""helping with both physical and cognitive work"".

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Cities collect vast amounts of data via sensors but is the smartphone actually the best way to connect citizens?

Cities already collect vast amounts of data via sensors embedded in infrastructure and even lamp posts, observing a range of metrics - from air quality and transport usage to the movement of people.

And, for probably the first time, ordinary people became interested in this information - how many cars are entering city centres or how many people are gathering in parks was suddenly directly pertinent to their health and well-being.

Prof Phil James measures what he calls the ""heartbeat of Newcastle"" from his urban observatory based at the city's university. He has seen incredible changes in the last few months.

""They were dramatic, off-the-cliff-type changes. Pedestrian footfall fell by 95%, traffic fell to about 40% of normal levels with much reduced peaks.""

One of the most powerful things about this data was ""the city council could see as national changes were announced how those changes were playing out in real-time in the city.""

""When garden centres opened we saw an increase in traffic as people went to buy potted plants.""

He hopes this data will be carried forward to make more permanent, post-pandemic changes, for ""pressing problems"" such as air pollution.

Image copyright Getg Image caption During lockdown, cycling took off as streets emptied of traffic and people avoided public transport

""When there was 50% of traffic, then we saw a 25% drop in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels. Unfortunately it has not stayed with us because traffic is now back to 80% of the normal, so we are hitting those barriers again.

""But as cities attempt to reduce carbon levels, the data helps understand the magnitude of these issues. Data should and can empower policy-makers and decision-makers.""

Post-pandemic cities need to also consider whether they want to make more permanent changes to transport, via electric vehicles and bikes, thinks Dr Robin North, who founded Immense, a firm that offers simulations of future cities.

""There is a huge opportunity to redesign the transport system brought on by the pandemic and the response to it. If we want to take advantage of that we have to be able to plan and think ahead,"" he told the BBC.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Skyscrapers started defining cities in the 19th Century but will they survive the 21st?

Some cities are already thinking about how they might change when the pandemic is over. Paris is experimenting with the idea of a 15-minute city - decentralised, mini-hubs where everything you need is within a 15-minute walk or bike ride.

The ""ville du quart d'heure"" is a key pillar of Mayor Anne Hidalgo's re-election campaign, turning Paris into a collection of ecologically transformed neighbourhoods.

And in the wake of the success of home working during lockdown, firms are starting to question the need for big, expensive, centrally located offices.

""The skyscraper's moment may be over. As a result of the pandemic, urban planners are going to have to rethink the idea of space,"" said Prof Richard Sennett, an urban planning expert who helped redesign New York City in the 1980s and who is currently chairman of the Council on Urban Initiatives at the United Nations.

""What we have built now are fixed, immobile structures that only serve one purpose.""

What is needed, he explained, is more flexible buildings, ones that can adapt to the short-term need for greater social distancing but also, in future, to changing economics which might mean offices need to become retail outlets or even homes.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption People have missed city bars and getting together for a drink

For him the biggest lesson of the pandemic is that cities need to be sociable places. He says that, not just because he is missing having a beer in a city bar, but also because he has seen how technology has worked better when it is used to help people communicate.

While track and trace apps have had mixed reviews and success, localised neighbourhood apps that keep people informed about rubbish collection times or enable them to help a sick neighbour have soared in popularity - what Prof Sennet calls a new era of ""neighbours responsible to strangers"".

Sensors may be good at collecting city data but actually the smartphones people carry around with them are far more powerful, he thinks.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption When the bustle of busy cities returns, how best do we monitor and understand the behaviour of crowds?

""Using an app to create communication between people is incredibly useful. There has been a lot more use of social apps.

""Sensors can't tell you why a crowd has gathered. We can replace the cop on the corner with a camera but what are we looking for?""

In San Diego, there are suggestions that smart street lights were used to spy on Black Lives Matter protesters, raising civil liberties questions.

And actually data is pretty dumb, said Prof James. ""I can tell you how many pedestrians are wandering through Newcastle city centre but I can't tell you why they decided to do that today.

""A smart city has to work with citizens, behavioural scientists, social policy-makers. It shouldn't just be about data and technology.""",2020-07-12,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-53192469
Jonathan Amos,OneWeb sale to UK-Bharti group gets court approval,"Image copyright ONEWEB Image caption Artwork: Bharti and the UK government are each putting in $0.5bn (£400m)

The sale of the failed satellite company OneWeb to Bharti Global Ltd of India and the UK government has been approved by a US bankruptcy court.

The two parties' joint bid of $1bn (£800m) secures them the firm's assets.

It means OneWeb will soon be able to resume building a space network capable of delivering broadband internet connections to all parts of the globe.

Ministers hope the resurrected firm can also transmit navigation signals as an alternative to the EU's Galileo system.

Britain walked away from involvement in the European project when it ceased to be a Union member state in January.

Friday's hearing, held under the auspices of the US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, was a key procedural moment in OneWeb's efforts to restore itself to financial health after running out of funds in March this year.

The company issued a statement in which it said: ""The parties will work to complete the plan sale process, including filing our plan and disclosure statements with the court, conducting voting with our creditors, and seeking regulatory approval and completing customary closing conditions, and expect the process to be completed by the fourth quarter of 2020.""

Image copyright ONEWEB Image caption The OneWeb HQ in west London has a control room to monitor and command satellites

OneWeb, which has its HQ in west London and parallel operations in Virginia, US, still has considerable challenges in front of it.

The rescue plan presented to the New York court on Friday only provides about $640m to take the business forward - after various settlement costs are taking into consideration.

Prior to seeking bankruptcy protection, the company had launched 74 satellites for a designed constellation of 648.

Manufacturing the remaining spacecraft and getting them all into orbit on a string of rockets will require additional investment that's been estimated by independent analysts to be in the region of at least $2bn. New commercial partners will therefore be needed.

The UK government's interest in OneWeb became public knowledge at the end of June. The merits of getting involved have attracted both support and criticism, with some describing the intervention as bold and others decrying what they believe will turn out to be a lost investment.

So far, ministers have revealed little of their intentions for OneWeb, although Business Secretary Alok Sharma told MPs this week that using the company's constellation for satellite navigation was not its prime consideration.

The greater motivation to back OneWeb, he said, came from a desire to see improved access to broadband internet in remote areas, and, in strategic terms, to raise the ambitions of the UK in space.

""I think there's been debate around [a Global Navigation Satellite System], and that wasn't the rationale for this particular investment. But of course, we are exploring how OneWeb... may be able to contribute to Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) resilience in the future,"" he explained during questions from the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (Beis) Committee of the House of Commons.

Image copyright OneWeb Image caption Artwork: The government says its principal interest is broadband connectivity

Eyebrows have been raised about the prospect of using OneWeb for satellite navigation. The company's planned constellation was designed with a very different purpose in mind and adapting it to take on this further role will not be straightforward.

But there is growing interest in doing PNT at lower altitudes than is traditionally the case with satellite systems like Galileo and the Americans' GPS network, whose spacecraft fly at over 20,000km in altitude.

OneWeb's spacecraft operate at 1,200km and sat-nav signals transmitted from this height would potentially be stronger and more robust in the face of efforts to jam or otherwise interfere with them.

Xona Space Systems is a US start-up working to develop a low-Earth orbit PNT solution with a 300-strong small satellite constellation.

It recently received pre-seed funding from the British space-specialist venture-capital operation Seraphim.

The company's CTO Tyler Reid told BBC News this week that its patent pending technology was aiming to achieve centimetre-level accuracies - the sort performance that will be needed by self-driving cars.

""Autonomous systems are reliant on precise location. To do that job and to do it well you really need to know your position down to the level of the paint on the road,"" he said.

""The width of the paint on the road is 10cm and that's really the level of the interaction of these vehicles.""

Kevin Peachey,Coronavirus: Can I get travel insurance and what are my travel rights?,"Image copyright Getty Images

Coronavirus has meant most people have been forced to abandon or hastily rearrange holiday plans for 2020, whether in the UK or abroad.

Foreign Office advice against all non-essential travel has now been lifted for countries where the public health risk is no longer ""unacceptably high"" and quarantine restrictions have been relaxed for travellers returning to the UK from dozens of countries.

Should I book my summer holiday?

Different parts of the UK are relaxing restrictions at different times, which opens the option of a staycation.

You are now allowed to stay overnight in many parts of the country and can travel as far as you want within the borders of the countries of the UK.

Many hotels, B&Bs, self-catering properties, caravan parks, campsites, hostels and boarding houses are now open or, in the case of Scotland, will be from 15 July.

The Welsh government has said that people are likely to be able to stay in self-contained accommodation or hotels with en-suite rooms from 11 July.

What about going abroad?

This is more complicated.

Foreign Office advice against all non-essential travel overseas has now been lifted.

Travel advice has been eased for countries and territories where the public health risk is no longer considered to be ""unacceptably high"".

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Flying is a very different experience in the age of coronavirus

As well as the official travel advice from the Foreign Office, there are exemption lists which mean anyone returning from those nations would not need to self-isolate for a fortnight upon their return.

This includes about 60 countries at present. Scotland's list of countries is slightly different to the list for England, Wales and Northern Ireland. For example, Scotland still requires people from Spain to quarantine.

Will travel insurance cover me if I get coronavirus?

Where the Foreign Office advice states UK residents should not travel, it is very unlikely that any travel insurance will be valid.

For example, Foreign Office advice against taking a cruise holiday remains in place as it does for travel to a number of high-risk countries.

In countries where travel is acceptable, according to the Foreign Office, there will be different cover depending on your policy.

While most policies will cover treatment for illness and injury while overseas, not all will do so for coronavirus-related illness.

A number of policies are now being sold that will cover people for emergency treatment or repatriation for Covid-19 contracted while in a resort, but not cases that arose by getting it beforehand in the UK.

What about insurance if I have to self-isolate?

Anyone still faces testing positive for the virus, or coming into contact with somebody who has it, and being alerted by the new test and trace systems being used in the UK.

The government has said it is a ""civic duty"" for people to self-isolate for 14 days after being notified of a contact.

This could lead to cancelled or delayed holidays, but insurance broadly falls into three categories:

Anyone who already had a travel insurance policy bought or renewed prior to around early March may still be able to make a claim for such a cancellation, but they should check their policy

Renewals of annual policies may now be unavailable, or have coronavirus exclusions. In other words, the terms may have changed and cover reduced

People buying travel insurance now are unlikely to be covered for any coronavirus-related delays or cancellations

Can I rearrange my package holiday if I develop symptoms?

Again, there will be relatively little protection for those who cannot travel because they are told to self-isolate or who develop symptoms just before they are due to travel.

Travel companies are unlikely to give a refund or allow people to rearrange in those circumstances.

People will also need to make a claim on their travel insurance if they are affected by the virus while abroad.

However, if the UK or a destination country announces fresh restrictions on travel, then a refund for the whole holiday or the opportunity to rearrange should be granted.

Can I get a refund for cancelled flights or package holidays?

Yes, but there have been delays for many people who have been seeking refunds for holidays cancelled while restrictions were in place - both abroad and in the UK.

The Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) told BBC News that people ""absolutely have the right to a refund"" for package holidays cancelled by a provider, but payments would take longer than the 14 statutory days.

Image copyright Getty Images

If your flight is cancelled, you are also entitled to a full refund to your original form of payment, within seven days. Huge backlogs mean these have been delayed considerably, prompting complaints to airlines and the regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority.

Many customers have reported their airlines have been offering a voucher for another flight instead of a refund.

And trade body Airlines UK told BBC News in early April, vouchers were its preferred method of compensation in a ""very grave"" financial situation.

If you are offered a voucher, or a free rebooking instead of cash, you can accept or refuse it.

But if the airline later folds, the voucher will probably become invalid.

If you rebook and later decide against going on a flight that has not been cancelled, you will have lost your right to a refund and are unlikely to be covered by your travel insurance.

The Association of British Insurers said travel insurance was to cover losses incurred by unforeseen circumstances and coronavirus no longer met that criteria.

People should also pay attention to ""disruption cover"" in terms and conditions, which may, or may not, pay out for costs such as unused hotel bookings or car hire.

Anthony Zurcher,Coronavirus: Things US has got wrong,"Image copyright Getty Images

So much for a summer lull in the coronavirus pandemic. Instead, the US has seen a resurgence of the disease in numerous states, particularly across the south and west.

The US nation as a whole has topped 60,000 recorded daily new cases this week.

Did it have to be this way, though?

Other industrialised nations, in Europe and Asia, pursued more rigorous mitigation plans, ramped up testing and contact tracing earlier, and eased restrictions in a slower and more co-ordinated fashion.

They have not, at least so far, seen a resurgence of the virus similar to the one the US is currently experiencing.

The US state of Arizona, for instance, is currently registering as many new cases of coronavirus as the entire European Union, which has a population 60 times greater.

It makes for a gloomy review of what's gone right and (mostly) wrong, as the US enters its fifth full month of a pandemic that has no end in sight.

WHAT'S GONE WRONG

States opened too quickly

A month ago, the coronavirus numbers in the US appeared, at the very least, stable. The spread of the disease had been slowed, as the daily tally of new cases plateaued.

That prompted a number of states - including Texas, California, Florida and Arizona - to move forward with plans to ease off public shelter-in-place and business closure orders.

Many of these states moved ahead despite not hitting the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended benchmarks for doing so, such as a 14-day drop in cases and less than 5% of tests coming back positive for the virus.

It turns out, the overall national numbers were misleading, as states that were hit hard early, such as New York and New Jersey, were experiencing declines, while numbers in other states were beginning to inch up.

They're not inching up anymore, they're surging - and the worst, as far as hospitalisations and fatalities, could be yet to come.

Now Texas, California and Arizona, among others, have re-imposed business closure orders and mandated mask-wearing, which has been determined to reduce the spread of the virus. It may be too little to avoid another public-health crisis, however.

""We opened way too early in Arizona,"" Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego, a Democrat, said in recent television interview. ""We were one of the last states to go to stay-at-home and one of the first to re-emerge.""

The 8,181 Covid-19 hospitalisations in Texas on Sunday were yet another record high. In Arizona, 14% of coronavirus tests are positive for the virus.

California, an early success story in limiting the spread of the virus, has seen a 90% increase in cases over the past two weeks, after the state in May allowed local authorities more discretion in businesses re-openings.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Why coronavirus cases are surging in Texas

The surge in cases is also again leading to delays and shortages in testing - an area that had appeared to be a strength for the US after a halting start.

Without adequate testing, it will be significantly more difficult to identify and isolate new cases and locations where the virus is spreading unchecked.

""We're right back where we were at the peak of the epidemic during the New York outbreak,"" former Food and Drug Administration commissioner Scott Gottlieb said during a television interview on Sunday.

At least for the moment, the rate of daily deaths has not reached New York levels - but that may only be a matter of time, as the current cases progress.

""It is already too late,"" says Luiza Petre, a New York City physician and professor of cardiology at the Mt Sinai School of Medicine. ""We're at a point of no return where it will be very, very difficult to restrain this pandemic.""

Mask-wearing became partisan

Compounding the decision by some states to prioritise reopening in spite of warnings from public-health officials, one of the best methods of limiting the spread of the virus - wearing a face covering - has become mired in partisan acrimony.

A June survey by Pew Research Center found that only 49% of conservative Republicans said they wore a mask most of the time in the past month, while that number is 83% among liberal Democrats.

Conservative opposition becomes even more entrenched at the prospect of government-enforced mask mandates.

""Kansans don't need Laura Kelly and the nanny state making decisions best left to individuals,"" Bill Clifford, a Republican congressional candidate in Kansas, said in response to a mask order from his state's Democratic governor. ""State mask mandates violate the principles of individual liberty and local control upon which America was founded.""

Donald Trump himself has contributed to the division, mocking a reporter who refused to remove his mask during a press conference as being ""politically correct"" and retweeting a Fox News journalist who suggested a photo of Joe Biden in a mask was damaging to the Democrat's image.

The president has steadfastly refused to wear a mask in public events - a position that has clearly registered with his supporters. At the president's campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in June, few in the crowd chose to use face-coverings, and most disregarded social-distancing suggestions.

Public-health officials aren't free from blame, either. Early on, they declared that face-coverings were only helpful for front-line medical personnel.

While the real motivation for such statements may have been to reserve limited supplies to those most in need, the end result was a message that was muddled and shifted as the pandemic progressed.

Public complacency

While some state governments have eased restrictions on public gatherings and allowed businesses to re-open, they have frequently accompanied such moves with recommendations that individuals make decisions based on medical advice and common sense.

Those recommendations have been, to put it mildly, not always heeded.

Summer holidays led to mask-less crowds in reopened bars and restaurants, public parks and beaches. And while masks were a fairly common sight during the mass anti-discrimination protests that swept the nation in the past month, social-distancing practices were essentially non-existent.

The numbers behind this new coronavirus surge indicates that many of the newly infected are younger Americans, who have been among the quickest to return to in-personal socialising. Some political leaders, including the president, have essentially encouraged this, asserting that the young and healthy have little to fear from the virus.

""Now we have tested over 40 million people,"" Trump tweeted on Saturday. ""But by so doing, we show cases, 99% of which are totally harmless.""

That flies in the face of public-health studies that have shown that a fifth of Covid-19 cases result in severe respiratory distress.

""We have data in the White House task force,"" US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn on Sunday, refusing to reject Trump's 99% figure as false. ""Those data show us that this is a serious problem. People need to take it seriously.""

But a president downplaying the severity of the disease can go a long way toward undermining words of warning from his subordinates.

Education approaching crisis

The coronavirus resurgence has also lit the fuse on a bomb that is set to explode in just a few months. September is when American children traditionally head back to classrooms across the nation, and it's becoming clear that nothing close to a normal educational experience is waiting for them.

School administrators are starting to unveil their plans for the coming academic year, and in many cases it's a blend of in-person and distance learning with the hope that it's enough to keep their institutions from becoming staging grounds for spreading the pandemic.

Already some teachers' unions are rebelling at the suggestion that educators - including elderly or those at greater health risk - return to classrooms with what they view as insufficient protection or preparation.

""Our educators are overwhelmingly not comfortable returning to schools,"" wrote the head of a Washington DC area teachers' union. ""They fear for their lives, the lives of students and the lives of their families.""

Meanwhile, parents facing the prospect of having to manage more de-facto home-schooling and figuring out how to care for and supervise their children while they, themselves, are being asked to return to their workplaces.

Trump, despite campaigning in 2016 against federal involvement in local education systems, is already pressuring schools to open back up on time. He's called for the CDC to revise its guidance to make it easier to reopen school buildings and threatened to cut off federal funds for those that don't comply.

Florida, a Republican-controlled state currently in the midst of a widespread coronavirus outbreak, already has ordered its schools to open for classes at the end of August.

The president's rhetoric, delivered via Twitter, seems destined to politicise yet another aspect of the coronavirus response, again putting local officials in the unenvious position of balancing community health concerns with demands to return to normal times that seem increasingly out of reach.

WHAT'S GONE RIGHT

New York recovery

Although the coronavirus situation in many US states in the south and west has become increasingly dire, what was once the epicentre of the outbreak - New York - has made remarkable improvements.

Daily deaths, which peaked on 8 April at 799, have dropped to single digits. Only 1.38% of the state's coronavirus testing last Friday returned positive results.

As other areas have re-imposed lockdown restrictions, New York has begun reopening many public facilities and private business such as salons, tattoo shops and youth sport leagues. Indoor restaurants, however, remain closed.

""What happened in New York should have been a cautionary tale for the other states to pay attention and learn to create a more centralised strategy,"" says Ms Petre, the New York City cardiologist. ""New York is a success story.""

As the state continues to ease its mitigation restrictions, there is the risk that the virus will return resurgent.

""We've been through hell and back, but this is not over,"" said New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. ""This can still rear its ugly head anywhere in this nation and in this state.""

Economy stabilised - for now

A funny thing happened on the way to the next Great Depression. The US economy, expected by many forecasters to be in a devastating tailspin, stabilised and began to improve.

May unemployment figures, predicted to top 20%, registered at 13.3% instead. Then, in June, they ticked down to 11.4% - an indication that the workplace haemorrhaging had been stopped much earlier than expected.

Meanwhile, key stock indices have bounced back from their late winter beating. By 2 July, the Dow Jones Industrial Index had recovered 66% of its losses from its February record high. The Standards & Poor's 500 Index, a broader measure of stocks, has made up 77% of its losses this year.

What Anthony wrote in April and May

Other economic indicators offer similar signs of an economic resurgence.

The strength of the recovery has largely been attributed to the push by states to quickly lift virus mitigation orders and federal action to provide economic support for businesses and individuals hit hardest by the virus.

The return of business closures in several states could mean the economic good news will be short-lived.

Meanwhile, most of the stimulus measures passed by Congress have either run their course or are set to expire soon, while there appears little prospect of further action.

""Since it is now clear that the effects of this crisis will be felt at least until the end of 2020, that relief package will not be enough,"" says Jill Gonzales, an analyst with the personal finance website Wallethub.

Science advancing

While the coronavirus afflicts a growing number of US states, the American medical community continues to grind away at treatments and, ultimately, a vaccine.

Remdesivir, an antiviral drug, has shown promise in limiting the severity of the disease in hospitalised patients (prompting the US government to strike a deal with the drug's manufacturer to prioritise American patients).

A new study indicates that the commonly available steroid dexamethasone cut the risk of death for coronavirus patients on ventilators by a third.

There are also ""encouraging signs"" from experts that the use of blood plasma from recovered Covid-19 patients could help those currently suffering from the disease, although clinical research is ongoing.

""Medicine has evolved at lightning speed,"" says Ms Petre. ""The government has teamed up with pharmaceutical companies and a lot has been done, which is good""

On the vaccine front, there are now several pharmaceutical companies reporting positive results from early tests on drugs to boost immunity to the coronavirus.

The president is promising a vaccine by the end of the year, if not earlier, although medical professionals caution that such a timeline is far from certain.

Anthony Fauci, the chief US immunologist, would only say scientists are ""aspirationally hopeful"" that a vaccine would be ready by 2021.

Given that a return to normal life in the US appears increasingly contingent on a safe and reliable vaccine, a lot is riding on these hopes.",2020-07-12,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-53337483
Katya Adler,Brexit: Will return of face-to-face talks mean progress?,"Image copyright EPA Image caption Unlike the recent videoconference, leaders plan to meet face-to-face - Covid-19 permitting

So the ""tiger in the tank"" (Prime Minister Boris Johnson's words) of EU-UK post-Brexit trade talks is all geared up to pounce.

Monday sees the start of a month of intensified negotiations between the two sides. This will include weekly meetings - at times in London, at others, in Brussels. And the first face-to-face talks since the Covid-19 pandemic hit Europe, infecting the EU and the UK's chief negotiators.

The idea of revving up the frequency of negotiating rounds was given a blessing at the highest political level a couple of weeks ago, when the prime minister held a summit via video link with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

Both sides have underlined their commitment to agreeing and ratifying a deal by the end of the year.

What can we expect after July's tiger pounce?

Well, the government wants to see the outline of an EU-UK trade deal by the end of the summer. This is in order to give UK businesses time to prepare themselves for a new working relationship with the EU, starting 1 January - after the transition period ends.

EU negotiators say they'll do their best.

Throughout this month, smaller groups of negotiators will focus on the main sticking points between the two sides- such as fishing and competition regulations, including environmental and - of key importance to the EU - state aid rules.

The hope is that face-to-face talks will facilitate the odd informal chat over coffee or a cooling-off walk around the block, allowing negotiators the breathing space to find solutions, rather than each side continuing to parrot already well-known red lines at one another via Zoom chat or similar.

But it's not going to be easy

Posturing and/or parroting is pretty straight-forward. Agreeing political compromises is anything but.

You could say, if they were not willing to make concessions, neither the EU, nor the UK would have signed up to releasing tigers into tanks.

Or you could cynically note that neither side would want to be seen to be the one responsible for a politically and economically costly no-deal scenario come the end of this year.

Brussels has indicated that it is willing to be flexible, as long as principles are protected, like protecting the single market. But what does that mean in practice?

EU leaders say they have full confidence in their chief negotiator, Michel Barnier. But at their summit earlier this month, they demanded he keep them well-informed every step of the way.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The UK and EU have so far failed to agree on fishing and competition rules

The EU's eight coastal nations are wary. They want to keep pretty much the same fishing rights in UK waters they enjoyed while the UK was a member state. Mr Barnier has described theirs as a ""maximalist position"". The other 19 EU members won't want trade talks with the UK to collapse over fishing.

EU divisions are not something to celebrate

The EU's united front may come under some strain as the pressure grows to compromise with the UK.

Pragmatic Germany assumes the EU's rotating six month presidency this week. Chancellor Angela Merkel is clear - she has repeatedly insisted that she's not in favour of pursuing a UK deal ""at any price"".

But no-deal would be costly to German businesses and a blot on her political legacy. She may find herself having to reason with France's Emmanuel Macron, who - so far - has taken the toughest line in Brexit negotiations.

That Franco-German ""drama"", if it ever unfolds (and if it does, it will likely be limited in size and play out behind closed doors) is one lined up for next season.

The Germans have a timetable, too - for their EU presidency. This summer, they say, is dedicated to trying to get all EU members behind a common recovery fund to help European economies hardest hit by Covid-19. The focus won't be on post-Brexit relations until the autumn, says Berlin.

Despite the rhetoric about racing for a summer deal, that timeline may be more comfortable for the prime minister. He might feel full freedom to manoeuvre, considering his 80-seat parliamentary majority. But compromises may be easier for him to make in the autumn, with the clock ticking down to a potential no-deal - which much of UK industry and many MPs would oppose.

One thing for London to remember: an EU divided over concessions would not be something to celebrate. Every EU country and the European parliament will need to give the nod to a future relations agreement. Or there will be no deal at all.",2020-07-12,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-53215711
Matt Mcgrath,Climate change: Ireland on the verge of its 'greenest government ever',"Image copyright Getty Images

Ireland stands on the brink of putting climate change at the heart of its government if Green Party members vote in favour of a new coalition.

The new administration plans to ban fracked gas imports from the US, make steep cuts in emissions and end new drilling for oil and gas.

Agreed in talks with two larger parties, the plan now needs the support of two thirds of Green members.

But there is opposition, with some saying it is not progressive enough.

The results of voting are expected on Friday evening.

Ireland's reputation as a clean and green country has been tarnished in recent years by the inability of successive governments to tackle carbon emissions.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A big increase in the national dairy herd has helped boost Ireland's emissions

Compared to the rest of the EU, Ireland is the fourth largest emitter per capita.

An agreed EU target to cut carbon by 20% by this year was missed by a country mile.

The main problems have been in transport and agriculture, with a growing national dairy herd increasing by more than a quarter in the past five years.

Voter concern over climate change saw a significant improvement in Green Party representation in parliamentary elections held in February this year.

With no one winning an overall majority, the Greens' 12 seats made them a key partner in coalition talks, with the two largest traditional parties, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.

Delayed by the Covid-19 crisis, negotiators eventually produced an agreed programme for government.

The issues of climate change and sustainability are at the heart of it.

The proposed cuts in emissions will be enshrined in a Climate Action law, which will define how five-year carbon budgets will be set.

This idea, which would see Ireland's emissions cut by 51% by 2030, is similar to existing legislation in the UK, and has been welcomed by scientists.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Younger greens have been the ones most likely to oppose the programme for government

""The achievement of the 7% annual cut in emissions would be a scientifically acceptable solution at least in the short- and medium-term for Ireland, given that we have been flatlining our emissions and failing to meet the targets we have signed up to,"" said John Sweeney, emeritus professor of geography at Maynooth University.

""It has a very strong influence if you embrace the carbon budget principle. And I think that's what will drive the achievement of reductions here so I am quite happy from a scientific point of view.""

As well as banning the importation of fracked gas from US shale production, the programme would stall any future oil and gas drilling in Irish waters.

The programme is likely to be approved by members of the two bigger parties - but the Greens' high bar of two thirds support makes the whole project uncertain.

Some experts believe that failure to support the deal would be a calamity, as the programme, they argue, would usher in the greenest government in the history of the state.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Green Party leader Eamon Ryan has a fight on his hands to convince members to back the coalition

""It's completely transformational,"" said John Gibbons, an Irish journalist and long time climate commentator.

""What this delivers is a quantum shift in Ireland's climate response. A ban on fracked gas is incredibly important, as is the ban on oil and gas exploration, this is saying to the multinational fossil fuel industry, Ireland is now off limits.""

Despite the potential gains, within the Green movement there is considerable opposition from members who feel that it doesn't address issues of social justice, housing and economic strategy.

""There's a new generation of activists that believe in climate justice and they don't feel that you can separate issues around housing, issues around finance, issues around taxation from environmental concerns,"" said Neasa Hourigan, who is a new Green party TD (Member of Parliament).

While she helped negotiate the programme for government, she is now urging members to reject it.

""Until you address everything in terms of the fabric of how we operate as a society, then really what you're doing is just compartmentalising something into one area and that's not going to effect real climate action,"" she told BBC News.

""It has to be system change instead of climate change.""

Image copyright PA Image caption Actor Mark Ruffalo is also well known as an anti-fracking campaigner

With opposition from young people and members of the party in Northern Ireland, Green leaders have turned to Hollywood, enlisting actor and environmentalist Mark Ruffalo to encourage members to back the deal.

With the result said to be down to a handful of votes, there are worries that opponents of the programme based in the jurisdiction of Northern Ireland may scupper a plan that won't directly impact them.

Some commentators are urging Green members to keep their eye on the bigger picture.

""In a climate emergency when your house is on fire, you deal with the emergency and then when that's stabilised we'll get onto all the other good stuff,"" said John Gibbons.

""This is the best chance, it's out of sight in terms of anything that's ever been on the table.""

Padraig Belton,'Horrible' offices look to tempt back workers,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Staff will go to great lengths to avoid touching buttons - this lift in Iran has been kitted out with small sticks for people to use

""Many of us spend most of our waking lives in offices and typically they're horrible,"" says Maciej Markowski, chief executive of spaceOS, a start-up based in Warsaw.

Before coronavirus offices were ""a mix of noise, distraction and an endless search for a free meeting room,"" he says.

Mr Markowski's company makes an app and other technology that connects tenants with their workplaces.

He thinks that if building owners want to keep their tenants happy, then they need to be looking at different kinds of data.

""The craziest thing is: corporate real estate is really data focused, you have tremendous information on occupancy, electricity and water usage,"" says Mr Markowski.

However, that ""doesn't give you a single clue what to do to keep a tenant, no idea what these people do in the building, what they like and dislike, any tools to keep them,"" he says.

With millions of people working from home since the coronavirus pandemic, office owners will have to work harder to tempt them back.

Image copyright SpaceOS Image caption Maciej Markowski, chief executive of spaceOS

Many staff are going to see big changes when they return.

""I popped in last week for a few hours, and saw some Star Trek-style sensors you wave your hand over to exit, rather than pressing a button,"" says Elizabeth Hoefsmit, managing director of Hampshire-based McGinley Aviation, which uses serviced offices in a business park.

It might be infrared temperature checks in the lobby, contactless lifts, or new apps to spread workers out and keep shared surfaces clean, but there's no doubt the post-coronavirus office is getting a drastic technological refit.

More Technology of Business

It could all start as soon as you wake up in the morning. You may check your building app, says David Garten, vice president at RXR Realty which owns and manages 93 properties in the New York area.

The firm's new app creates a building health index each day, from information like air quality, the number of occupants, and how well social distancing is being observed.

If your building has a low rating that day, you might decide to work from home, or go to a smaller satellite office instead.

The app will also tell you the ideal time to arrive, to reduce congestion, and people riding public transport at peak times. ""So the ideal time for me to walk through our lobby is 10am,"" says Mr Garten.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Fever screening is a common sight

Then on entering, you may pass through an infrared fever-screening system, says James Lawrence of Gensler, a large design and architecture firm based in San Francisco.

FLIR Systems, one Oregon company that makes these crowd thermal cameras, has seen its demand increase 700%.

If a concierge judges you high risk from the infrared screening, they might double-check your temperature with a handheld device. Then, you might need to have your meeting by video conference from a quarantine room, or take a car home or to hospital.

If you make it through the lobby, then perhaps you will operate the lift with buttons on your app. Once upstairs, it will tell you when your workstation was last cleaned, Mr Garten says.

When it gets to lunchtime, you'll order food by an app, says John Robson, asset director at Workspace, which has 69 office properties around London focusing mainly on small companies.

Image copyright Workspace Image caption Workers will probably have to spread out more

""Every transaction is cashless now, and your food will basically be grab and go,"" he says.

If you pop to the loo after lunch, you'll be increasingly looking at touchless taps, Mr Lawrence says.

New software is helping companies spread people out.

Gensler's tool ReRun imports floor plans, calculates safe bubbles around each worker, and then outputs different ways to place workers so their bubbles do not overlap.

""Recently we did an analysis on a two million square-foot building that took roughly 10 days to turn around. Otherwise it would've taken several weeks,"" says Mr Lawrence.

For the same reason, some companies are looking to teach artificial intelligence (AI) to video cameras.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Artificial intelligence can look for office ""pinch points""

AI algorithms can offer feedback about ""pinch points"" where people are too close together, while protecting individual privacy, says Dr Mahesh Saptharishi, Motorola Solutions' chief technology officer, based in Boston.

Instead of watching the actual video, they can ask the AI how well social distancing is being observed overall, and where problem points are. ""So employees don't feel someone's watching what they do,"" he says.

Meanwhile, your cleaner might well be employee of the month for many months to come.

An April study in The Lancet Microbe showed the virus can last on plastic and stainless steel (like door handles) for up to seven days, and glass (like screens) for four days.

Cleaning wipes can disrupt the layer of fat that surrounds and protects coronavirus. And bleach's active ingredient sodium hypochlorite destroys the crown of protein spikes that gives the virus its name, and the ribonucleic acid (RNA) which is its blueprint to reproduce. So does the ethanol in surgical spirits.

But it would be helpful to know which surfaces should be cleaned.

Contact tracing needs to keep track of the surfaces and facilities you and sick colleagues used, says Matt Calkins, head of US software development platform Appian, which has also made coronavirus workplace safety software.

If you know which of your rooms to target, you know where best to send your deep cleaning team, and maximise use of your bleach, ethanol and wipes, Mr Calkins says.

The virus can also be carried in the air, on water droplets or fine dust particles, say researchers. So what about air conditioning systems?

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Office owners will be working hard to make their buildings attractive

The UK government says the risk of air conditioning spreading coronavirus in the workplace is ""extremely low"".

Nevertheless, ""we're advising organisations to look at their air conditioning system,"" says Dr Mark Parrish, Northern European medical director from International SOS, which advises companies about medical risks.

Filters with extremely narrow openings - like high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) and the more powerful ultra-low particulate air (ULPA) ones - can remove coronavirus from circulating in the air, according to UK air filter manufacturer SPCB.

The problem is such ventilation systems will normally need stronger fans to push air through these narrower filters, it says.

Upgrading air conditioning could be one of many options used by office owners to keep their tenants happy.

Maciej Markowski of spaceOS says simple convenience might be the winning factor.

""It's ridiculous that you're in a building and it's easier to order food from across town than the restaurant downstairs. Or with three taps on your phone you can tell Amazon a package is broken, but there's no way to tell your building there's a huge spill in front of your office.""",2020-07-12,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-53056585

The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world. This week we speak to Andrew Day, chief executive of computer games developer Keywords Studios.

Andrew Day knows from personal experience just how addictive some computer games can be.

""I have one of those horrible personalities, that if I open a game, I find, before I know where I am, that I have spent tens of hours on it,"" says the 56-year-old.

""Back in 2013... I went for a little break, I was lying beside a swimming pool with nothing to do. So I picked up my phone and started playing Candy Crush.

""That was in June. I had to give it up in my New Year's resolutions the following year, because I was just losing so much time on the game. So yes, I have to be a little bit careful.""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Andrew says he was a big fan of Candy Crush

Andrew is chief executive of Irish company Keywords Studios. Even if you are an avid gamer, you might not have heard of the Dublin-based firm.

However, the business has helped make many of the world's most popular games - from Fortnite, to Clash of Clans, League of Legends, and Assassin's Creed.

""The full list of games we have worked on is slightly infinite,"" says Andrew.

Keywords employs 7,500 people at 59 offices around the world, from Montreal to Tokyo, and in 2019 it had annual revenues of €326.5m ($369m; £295m).

The business remains under the radar because it doesn't release games under its own name. Instead it is employed by the world's largest gaming companies to help them make their products.

It does everything from produce whole games, to parts of them, or handling the transfer from one platform to another, such as making an Xbox game work on a PlayStation.

Or it will design and make all the visual aspects of a game, everything you see, such as the characters, the buildings and weapons. ""All of those are digital assets, and they get produced by artists, and we are the largest providers of video games art in the world,"" says Andrew.

Image copyright Keywords Studios Image caption Keywords has staff around the world, including at its office in Mexico City, pictured

In addition, Keywords offers a testing service for nearly completed games, to check that they work correctly. And it has an audio business whereby actors - famous or not so famous - provide a game's voices and dialogue, and it adds all the music and sound effects.

Further, the company is the world's largest provider of games translation services - converting games into 50-plus languages.

Then after a game has been released, Keywords has staff who offer customer support under a client's name. So if you phone a gaming company demanding help to get you to the next level, you may actually be put through to Keywords employees.

It is a big operation for Andrew to lead, and while coronavirus has temporarily clipped his wings, he typically spends ""half my time"" travelling around the world.

It is a far cry from Keywords' humble beginnings in 1998, when a friend of Andrew's, Giorgio Guastalla, set up a small firm in Dublin offering translation services to business software providers. It grew slowly until Andrew was asked to join and lead the company in 2009, by which time it was solely operating in the gaming sector.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Keywords has been helped by the growing popularity of computer games

""He had been asking me for a number of years, he thought I could really grow and make something of the business,"" says Andrew. ""At the time it was just 50 people in an office in Dublin.""

Andrew was born and raised in South Africa. He and his family moved to the UK when he was 16, settling close to London. After gaining a management degree from Bradford University, he then had a varied career in business.

He started working for cigarette firm Rothmans, before moving into mergers and acquisitions in a number of industries, and then finally specialising in the technology sphere.

Andrew's plan for Keywords was big expansion, helped by using his knowledge of organising takeovers to buy firms, which would allow the business to expand the services it could offer gaming companies. His joining the business also happily coincided with the huge growth in popularity of computer games over the last decade.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Andrew hopes that Keywords will become a €1bn business

To accelerate its growth and acquisitions, in 2013 Andrew floated Keywords on the London Stock Exchange's AIM market, which raised some £30m.

""It has been a rare example of spotting an opportunity, having that vision, then creating a business plan and following it religiously,"" says Andrew.

Technology sector analyst Patrick O'Donnell of Irish stockbrokerage Goodbody, says, ""Andrew Day has been critical for Keywords.

""Keywords has completed over 40 acquisitions under Andrew's leadership, and is now clients to 23 of the top 25 global video gaming publishers, and all top 10 mobile game developers,"" he says.

More The Boss features:

These companies all use Keywords because it is cheaper and more convenient for them to give it work to do it rather than employ vastly more staff in-house. ""We get projects to do,"" says Andrew. ""So if the gaming firms did this work in-house, at the end of a certain project they could have staff just sitting around.""

Andrew says that Keywords has no plans to ever release its own games, or as he puts it, ""bite the hands that feed it"". Instead he thinks the firm will grow to see annual sales of €1bn, such is the growing demand for its services, from a gaming industry with total revenues of more than $159bn (£127bn) per year.

He is, however, still wary of playing the games himself. ""I find it hard to put a game down. I want to complete it, to move to the next level. Or if I'm playing the same level over and over again I want to do it faster, or jump higher, or catch more coins. It appeals to my personality rather sadly.""",2020-07-12,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-53248321

What is it you do again? Before the coronavirus lockdown a lot of us didn't really know what our partner did at work. Our eyes have been opened.

""I was just mum,"" says Samar Small, looking back to life before lockdown. Her family didn't give a second thought to what she did day to day.

Samar is a manager at Royal Mail, responsible for a range of things, including communicating with bulk buyers of stamps (like the supermarkets), mail redirection services, and overseeing Santa Mail, planning for which commences in May.

She usually works out of the Cardiff Mail Centre with colleagues hot-desking around her. Since March she has swapped that for the kitchen table in her three-bedroom semi, with her husband and two teenagers milling around, picking up snippets of conversations involving big projects and huge sums of money.

""They hear the figures being bandied round: 'What about that £2m?' It's not what they expected,"" she says.

Her husband Stephen goes into work at weekends, in a role at Royal Mail that she used to do herself, so she has a good grasp of what he's doing. But it's the first time he's had much insight into what she does all day.

""I'm probably a bit brainier than he thought I was - dare I say it!"" she says.

""It's been a bit of an eye-opener,"" admits Stephen. There are the stacks of spreadsheets, all the financial accounting acronyms, and the hours and hours on the phone to everyone from suppliers to senior managers.

He's been ""blown away"", he says, by just how professional she is all round, her confidence in challenging other people's plans if she sees a flaw, and her eloquence and firmness in meetings.

""Most of us find that we get to know somebody perfectly well, and can love and live with them, and still not know what they do,"" says psychologist and executive coach Sue Firth. ""It's quite revelatory to see what your other half does.""

Discovering more will often reinforce mutual respect, she says, including when parents with jobs find out just how much work it takes to keep the house and children in order.

The learning curve has been steeper for some than others. ""Kirsty"" from Sheffield estimates her police officer husband knew ""pretty much zero"" about her job as a financial consultant before lockdown. (She didn't want us to use her real name because of her husband's profession.)

""He had no clue. He struggled to tell people what I did,"" she says.

More than anything, he's staggered by the level of responsibility she has, and the sheer volume of work on her plate.

""[Before lockdown] he never understood why I was working so late. He probably thought I was hanging out having a drink,"" says Kirsty. Now her husband sees her working 12-hour days.

As for her, she can't help but get a lot more insight into his work, when every few minutes his police control centre radio is crackling into life.

Having a husband who is in the police means she's already a bit ""hardened"" to what she hears, but the call-outs for suspected suicides are still always awful to hear and much more frequent than she expected.

He's a detective constable, so has to collate files of evidence for the Crown Prosecution Service. That means sitting on a laptop and liaising with colleagues on video calls like the rest of us. There's a lot of paperwork, but there's the added pressure of dealing with people and events that are often shocking and unpleasant.

Kirsty admires the way he remains professional no matter what, and feels she's getting a more realistic idea of what it is like to work on the frontline. ""People don't realise how busy they are,"" she says. ""The stuff he has to see, to deal with day in, day out.""

'Who even are you?'

Working from home means we're not just learning about what our other half does for a living, but how they go about it, and what their ""work personalities"" are like too.

""I don't think we ever know our 'work version' of our partners. Mine used the phrase 'sense check' the other day, I was like 'who even are you?!',"" says Alison Hinchliffe from Mottram in Greater Manchester.

Her husband Scott works for an American company, and she says she notices a lot of cross-cultural phrases on his Zoom calls.

He's also seen a different side to her.

""I work in arrears recovery for a social landlord, and obviously have a lot of worried and distressed people on the phone,"" says Alison. She says she's ""not a very sentimental person"", so when Scott hears her on the phone, ""he laughs and says he never realised how much compassion I have"".

Spouse ultimatums

Working from home won't always bring out the best in our partner though, says Sue Firth. If you find yourself living with the ""sergeant major"" version of your husband or wife it can cause friction.

For example, she says several of the executives she coaches are struggling to cope without the fix of adrenaline they usually get from being in the office environment.

""Some are getting frustrated and are difficult to live with because what matters to them is winning, competition, control,"" she says. Some of their spouses have had to issue ultimatums - you work in your study, and when you come out you don't bring your phone. Other executives she's spoken to are tense and can't relax, which isn't easy for partners and kids either.

Sheri Jacobson, founder of psychotherapy clinic Harley Therapy in London, says such revelations don't have to undermine a relationship if dealt with well.

""It's perfectly possible a person is a tyrant at work and a gentle soul at home, and you see both parts when you're working from home together,"" she says. ""But with the general rules of communication and empathy it can be worked through.""

Yet even if you only discover very positive traits in your partner, there is the risk of jealousy arising, if you see them getting on a little too well with a colleague for example.

""Your partner will be pretty attuned to notice if there's any romantic spark or flirtation going,"" Sheri warns.

But on a work level too, she says seeing your partner in super-efficient, super-connected mode can feel ""a bit threatening to some people"".

""It's possible to feel outdone by your partner because they have better abilities than you were aware of.""

Opposites attract?

Fortunately, that couldn't be further from the case for Mattia Zambaldi and Frankie de Tavora, who have been working alongside each other in their London flat.

They've found plenty of things they don't have in common. He works for stadium management at Arsenal FC, she doesn't like football. He gets up punctually at 6:30am, she rolls up, interrupting his meetings, at 9:30. She's ""goofy by nature"" and, working in hospitality as an events and sales manager, is used to an unstructured week. He wears a body brace to ensure a healthy posture and insists on set meal times.

But they're both gushing with admiration for the other's abilities.

Image copyright Frankie de Tavora Image caption Frankie is impressed by Mattia's ability to be both professional and himself

""She's very sharp,"" says Mattia. ""She understands straight away topics that are not straight forward. When it comes down to being professional, sometimes I wonder why she's not at the top of a big company.""

""I'm super-impressed,"" says Frankie. ""His dedication is clear to me.""

She says Mattia is able to be both professional and genuinely himself at the same time, and has a vast array of skills. She feels lucky that her future children will have a father with such knowledge.

And if the hours working side-by-side have taught them one thing, it's that they want to spend more time together, not less. So instead of going back to work, Frankie is considering returning to university. That way she can have weekends and evenings free.

But for some, there are downsides to spending so much time with your partner in a work environment.

""I've discovered a severe dislike of his music,"" says Alison Hinchliffe. ""Phil Collins is awful. I knew I didn't like him before but I can't stand him now!""",2020-07-12,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-53233813
Ashitha Nagesh,This police-free protest zone was dismantled - but was it the end?,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Less than a month after it was set up, Seattle's Chop protest zone was cleared

On 8 June, after a number of increasingly dangerous clashes between protesters and law enforcement, police officers in a popular area of downtown Seattle abandoned their precinct.

Hundreds of activists, who had been demonstrating against police brutality since the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May, then flocked to the neighbourhood and set up a peaceful occupied protest. There, they distributed free food and medical supplies, planted community gardens, and held film screenings and workshops. One small group painted a large, bright statement on a wall within the zone: ""Black Lives Matter"".

The area was declared the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone - or Chaz, for short. It was to be a police-free, self-governing utopia. A few days later, in an interview with CNN on 11 June, the city's Democratic mayor Jenny Durkan said the zone could herald a ""summer of love"".

Protester Grace Morgan, from Portland, Oregon, told the BBC that she travelled up to the Chaz about a week after it had been established.

""It was absolutely astonishing,"" she said. ""There was a food co-op, as well as a full medics corner with actual doctors from around the city that had volunteered, and had their own ambulance. There were classes, lectures, speakers, poetry, lots of live music, huge works of art… It was really beautiful.""

Image copyright Grace Morgan Image caption Grace went to the Chaz, as it was then known, about a week after it was established

Crucially, Chaz had the official backing of socialist councilmember Kshama Sawant.

""The idea of occupation isn't a new one, and it's an immensely powerful idea as a part of protest movements,"" Ms Sawant told the BBC. ""Not only social movements on the streets, but also in workplace actions through history.""

The initial success of Chaz, which later came to be known as Capitol Hill Occupied Protest (Chop), inspired activists across the US. On 18 June another autonomous zone sprung up in Portland, Oregon. It was declared the Patrick Kimmons Autonomous Zone, or PKAZ, named after a 27-year-old black man who was killed by Portland police in September 2018.

""Sometime around midnight, more tents started to pop up on the street - and then word got around that we were building an autonomous zone right there and then,"" Grace, who also saw PKAZ get set up, said. ""Me and a few of my friends got rolling dumpsters from surrounding businesses and condos in the area, and somebody got a huge couch somehow. There are also quite a few construction sites nearby, so we got a lot of scaffolding from those to help reinforce the borders.""

The atmosphere that night, she said, was ""pretty magical"".

""People were making beats and music just with the things we had around us… and a few spontaneous dance parties broke out,"" she said. Police officers stayed away for most of the night, which Grace said felt ""pretty suspect"": ""Every other night, the cop presence had been very strong - they had been constantly breaking us up, tear-gassing us, and shooting us with rubber bullets, flash bangs and pepper balls.""

But the PKAZ only stood for about five hours. The police arrived at about 05:30, reportedly in full riot gear. ""There were about 30 of them and they started dismantling the barriers and telling people to leave,"" Grace said.

Image copyright Grace Morgan Image caption The Patrick Kimmons Autonomous Zone in Portland stood for about five hours

Another autonomous zone, this time on the other side of the country, suffered a similar fate. On 22 June, activists cordoned off an area just north of Lafayette Square in Washington DC. They set up tents and put up signs reading: Black House Autonomous Zone, or Bhaz. The name ""Black House"" was to place it in contrast to the nearby White House.

By the following morning, Bhaz had been dismantled by the police, and President Donald Trump had vowed in a tweet to meet protesters with ""serious force"" if they tried to rebuild the area - a threat so serious that Twitter placed a warning flag on it.

And later that week, in Philadelphia, protesters briefly brought a disused hospital back to life. On 27 June a crowd marched to Hahnemann Hospital, set up barricades, canopies, and tables, and nurses began treating patients on the spot. It lasted for less than an hour.

The occupation was led by a coalition of healthcare workers and community members called Care Not Cops, which calls for funding that currently goes to the local police force to be reinvested in preventative public services, such as healthcare and community centres.

Local residents say Hahnemann primarily served low-income and black communities before it was permanently closed by its owner, real estate developer Joel Freedman, in September last year. As the coronavirus started sweeping through the US with force earlier this year, Mr Freedman told local media he had offered to sell the hospital to the city, or lease it for almost $1 million a month - $60 per day per bed, plus utilities and other running costs. The city couldn't afford it, and so despite the growing public health crisis the hospital has remained empty.

""The hospital shut last summer to immense local resistance, and the owner's attempt at extracting a ransom during the pandemic made it a really potent symbol of privatised health,"" local reporter Max Fox, who took part in the protest, told the BBC. ""So there was a lot of pent up anger.""

At the time of his offer, a spokesman for Mr Freedman told US media that he had offered to sell the hospital to the city below market rates, and that he had ""not only desired to be helpful to the city… but he was very reasonable"".

Although brief, the Hahnemann Hospital occupation touched on a crisis that has run parallel to these protests - access to healthcare, particularly as the US has the world's highest number of coronavirus infections and the highest death toll.

Patrick Cline heads up an organisation called the Frontliners, which distributes medical supplies to protesters across the US through a network across different parts of the country, including Seattle. He told the BBC he started the organisation after seeing a police officer destroy medical supplies at a protest.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Before leaving the precinct in early June, Seattle police deployed tear gas and flashbang grenades against protesters

""He took his elbow and put it through a medic table - and all of the food and medical supplies spilled out onto the ground, and he stomped with his foot on the medical supplies,"" he said. Later, he saw videos of other officers doing the same thing in other parts of the country. ""[Medics] weren't there to burn down buildings and whatnot, they were just there to help others being injured.""

Councilmember Sawant accused the police in Seattle of targeting medics, too.

""Early on in the Capitol Hill movement, when the protest movement was facing down police violence, it was not only that the police were targeting peaceful protesters with mace and tear gas - they were targeting the medic tents near the protest action,"" she told the BBC. ""I can tell you from personal experience how horrific it is. I was personally among the hundreds who were there. We were tear gassed and maced, and the number of flashbang grenades that were exploded… it looked like a war zone.""

Then, there were the shootings.

There were four shootings at the Chop in a 10-day period towards the end of June, two of which were fatal. The first shooting happened in the early hours of 20 June, killing 19-year-old Horace Lorenzo Anderson and injuring a 33-year-old man. A second shooting the next day left a 17-year-old boy injured, and another person was wounded in a third shooting two days later. In the fourth shooting, on 29 June, a 16-year-old boy was shot and a 14-year-old boy was left critically injured. Allegations of sexual assault and mental health crises within the zone began to be reported, too.

Although protesters insisted the violence wasn't directly connected to Chop, the atmosphere in the community began to change.

Some officials who had previously been supportive of the protest zone began to sour, too. Mayor Durkan walked back her ""summer of love"" comments, and at the end of June announced that the zone would be dismantled, claiming the movement's message had ""been undermined by violence"". On 1 July, Chop reached a violent end.

The Seattle Police Department tweeted that anyone who remained in the area, or returned to it, would be arrested. After the area was cleared, Police Chief Carmen Best tried to put a nail in the idea of a police-free society, telling reporters: ""Enough is enough.""

Daniel Baryon, an anarchist YouTuber from Tulsa who spent a week in Chop towards the end of its existence, said the zone felt like it was on its ""last legs"" - and in contrast to the hopeful atmosphere when it was first established, negative coverage, a lack of democratic process and a toxic atmosphere all contributed to protesters feeling a ""lack of enthusiasm"" towards the end.

But the movement is looking to the future, he told the BBC.

""People are trying a tactic and seeing how it works, what the successes and the failures are, and how they should move forward,"" he said. ""I don't want to get too specific, but the direction many people are going in is towards organising neighbourhoods, democratic structures that allow people to make decisions together, and to create an autonomous zone but the other way around - by building citizen power first, and then declaring autonomy, instead of seizing an autonomous zone in a spontaneous moment and then having to work through the chaos.""

This democracy, he adds, would be ""a consensus process - it's not electing representatives to decide for you, but it's everybody sitting down, forming the path forward together through discussion, and voting as a direct democracy"".

For Grace, the autonomous zone was never meant to last forever. ""I think it's sad and symbolic, and the way the police dismantled it was really terrible,"" she said. ""But I don't think it was meant to be a permanent thing... it was meant to be a moment in time, a piece de resistance - and in that way it served its purpose.""",2020-07-12,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-53218448
Tara Mckelvey,Coronavirus: Disease detectives track an invisible culprit,"Image copyright Getty Images

Disease detectives are trying desperately to beat the clock and find those who have been exposed to the virus. Can they move fast enough to stop the pandemic?

As a public-health director in Savannah, Georgia, Cristina Pasa Gibson spent her time in an office filled with calorie counters and yoga mats and the scent of jasmine tea. Then she started working on contact tracing, a no-holds-barred effort to stop the pandemic, and her office and her life were turned upside down. ""I felt like I was in a Vegas casino,"" she says. ""I didn't know what time it was, what day it was, who I was.""

She and her colleagues in Savannah and her counterparts in other cities across the country have been working frantically to trace the path of the infection and to find those who may have been exposed to the virus. They talk to patients, asking for names of individuals they have spent time with, and chase down those individuals and to tell them to remain isolated so they do not infect others.

The pressure on investigators and contact tracers has been intense. ""I basically lived in my office,"" says Gibson, describing the early days. ""It was Groundhog Day over and over.""

Today their role is even more important. The US now has the highest number of cases and deaths in the world.

Red State, Blue State

Gibson is grappling with the pandemic, and she and her colleagues are trying to use contact tracing as a way to contain the virus. Her counterparts in New Haven, Connecticut, a city that lies almost 900 miles to the north, are also working feverishly to track the disease. Yale University student Tyler Shelby, 26, the son of a Kansas police detective and a fan of the fictional detective Sherlock Holmes (played by Benedict Cumberbatch in a BBC version), helped to organise an investigative squad and coordinates dozens of volunteers.

Cristina Pasa Gibson of Savannah and Tyler Shelby of New Haven are struggling with life-or-death matters in a country where people are deeply divided in their views of the pandemic and how the government should manage the health crisis.

The number of cases has shot up in Georgia, Florida, Texas and other states where governors tried to reinforce Trump's message about the nation's economic comeback. Meanwhile the number of cases in Connecticut, New York and other northern states, places initially hit hard by the virus, has gone down.

The contact-tracing initiatives in New Haven and Savannah are far from perfect. But they have been recognised by experts in the field as programmes that were started early and run with vigour. Taken together, these two programmes offer a snapshot of the high-stakes drama of contact tracing and show how the system is being put in place in both the northern and the southern parts of the country.

Uncovering secret lives

Gibson spoke recently on the phone in her Savannah office with someone who had tested positive: ""He asked me: 'Am I going to die?' That's a terrible question to be faced with because so much is unknown. I could not give that person a definite answer."" Talking to people on the phone when they are scared and anxious is hard. In addition, the people who work in contact tracing have to find out key information from those who have gotten sick.

Image caption Cristina Pasa Gibson, shown at her parents' house in Gainesville, Virginia, beats drumsticks in a workout class to reduce pandemic stress

Investigators and contact tracers try to find out whom the patients spoke to during a two-day period before they became ill and for the period of time beyond that - until they isolated themselves from others. That means recalling anyone they saw for more than 15 minutes and who stood or sat within six feet of them. Did you see a movie, take an Uber or go to church? If so - did you stop for donuts? an investigator may ask, according to a government report on contact-tracing programmes.

The challenges are immense: ""You're asking people to think back,"" says Yale student Tyler Shelby. This raises the possibility for potentially awkward conversations: ""You don't necessarily need to specify who they slept with. It's really just anybody that meets that criteria"", or the guidelines that define close contact as anyone within six feet of you.

The conversations with a patient on the phone can be tough, with long silences. ""Definitely people can have hesitation,"" Shelby says.

""My first call - I was really nervous,"" says Yale student Paulina Luna Martinez, who is 27. She soon found it easy to speak with the people, though, and spends about a half-hour with each: ""They talk about their lives."" She and the other volunteers send back the lists of contacts they have compiled, and a separate group of people tracks down the individuals on these lists, men and women who have been exposed to the virus.

One of the most important aspects of contact tracing is helping those who are struggling. People who test positive need to stay separated from others, but they may need help. Those who have been exposed to the virus but remain healthy may not have enough money to see them through two weeks of isolation.

As Columbia University's Patrick Kachur, explains, offering help to those who are sick and trying to protect others from the virus is one of the most important aspects of contact tracing. ""People think: 'This has to work because this is a key to getting back our lives,"" he says. ""But it's more than just counting cases and closing investigations. It's putting people in touch with the services they need.""

Image copyright Courtesy of family Image caption ""My first call - I was really nervous."" says Paulina Luna Martinez, shown above on the left, with housemate Elsie Gonzalez in New Haven

In New Haven and Savannah, the investigators and contact tracers help people contact officials with social-service agencies if they need a place to stay during quarantine or would like someone to deliver groceries. In Nevada, says Adriane Casalotti, a spokeswoman for the National Association of County and City Health Officials, they feed their horses.

Running against the clock

Contact tracing has a long history - the system was used to stop the spread of syphilis in the US in the 1930s. More recently, tracers ferreted out cases of Ebola in West Africa and other countries and helped beat back the disease. Yet contact tracing has never been used on a virus as ferocious as Covid-19, on such a broad scale, and these factors have helped to expose shortcomings in the tracing system.

In England, the inefficiencies of the NHS Test and Trace, as the contact tracing programme is known, have been exposed by the BBC and other media.

Analysts at the Center for Health Security say that the cost of the contact tracing, if done properly across the nation, would be steep: $3.6b USD. Yet only some of the resources are available. According to NPR, about 37,000 tracers have so far been assigned to the task

New Haven and Savannah are both about the same size. New Haven has a population of about 130,000, and Savannah has a population of 145,000. But Cristina Pasa Gibson and Tyler Shelby and others who live in these two cities have experienced the pandemic in different ways.

Image copyright Courtesy of Mark Abraham Image caption DataHaven's Mark Abraham, right, with his son in New Haven during a stay-at-home order, maps areas where the virus has struck

New Haven, a city once known for its manufacturing industry and now for its university, Yale, is close to the New York epicentre. For many New Yorkers, New Haven is the end of the line, the place where they step off the train. In April, New Haven officials were reporting 20-35 new cases each week per 10,000 people, according to DataHaven, a nonprofit organisation, a spike that was caused partly by people from New York. By late June, more than 1,070 people had died of the disease in New Haven and the surrounding county.

Savannah is a port city far from the coronavirus hotspots. In April, while Cristina Pasa Gibson and her colleagues were organising their team, they had fewer cases to manage. Officials in Savannah and the surrounding Chatham County reported only one or two new cases each week per 10,000 people, according to DataHaven. By late June, 37 people in Chatham County had died.

The number of cases in New Haven started to drop in the springtime. Slowly, though, cases in Savannah and Chatham County began to climb. The explanation for the disparity in infection rates between New Haven and Savannah are varied and complex. Geography plays a role, but so do decisions made by political leaders.

The Republican governor of Georgia and the leaders of other states in the southern part of the country rushed to restart their economies. The Democratic governor of Connecticut and leaders of other northern states waited.

New Haven embodies the northern model - investigators and tracers were quickly deployed in large numbers (more than 150 were put in rotation, and they have since merged with a statewide group of several hundred). Savannah reflects the southern model of contact tracing and review of cases: their 49-member team is leaner.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Activists in Texas protest against contact tracing programmes

Albert Ko, a professor of epidemiology at Yale School of Public Health who serves on a state board, the Reopen Connecticut Advisory Group, says the New Haven team is doing an above-average job. Experts have also praised the efforts in Savannah.

In both cities, though, investigators are struggling to contact people fast enough. They are floundering in other ways too. The Savannah team members often find themselves without a Spanish speaker and rely on a Spanish-language phone line. In New Haven, they only managed to conduct interviews with 64% of the individuals they tried to contact, according to an epidemiologist with the New Haven health department.

Investigators and tracers should be able to contact 90% of patients within a day of hearing that they have the virus, according to the industry standard.

Still, says Patrick Kachur, a Columbia University professor who used to work for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a programme like the one in New Haven has value. ""It's two-thirds of the way to 90%,"" Kachur says. ""Even if it can't be done perfectly, it's still worth doing.""

Looking for clues

Last winter Tyler Shelby, who is studying for both a Yale medical degree and a public-health doctorate, was working at a cubicle decorated with potted vines and getting ready to go to Uganda on a Fulbright scholarship. Then he started seeing news about Covid-19 on Reddit. ""I thought: I'm needed right here,"" he says. He began working with his colleagues on a contact-tracing programme. Soon the number of cases shot up.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Public-health experts say 180,000 more people are needed for contact tracing, and US national guard members are being trained

Shelby and others on his team dug in and became specialists in US-based ""shoe-leather epidemiology"", as a Vermont health official, Daniel Daltry, puts it. Their heroes are amateur sleuths on true-crime podcasts and legendary figures such as Watson, the sidekick to the fictional detective Sherlock Holmes. Watson could always ""go with the flow"", says Shelby: ""He puts up with Holmes, but he's observant himself.""

The disease detectives are a diverse lot: working with Shelby, Yale medical student Paulina Luna Martinez began calling patients from her group house in New Haven. Maritza Bond, the city's public-health director, studied a heat map of her old neighbourhood, Fair Haven, an area filled with Puerto Rican families that became a Covid hot spot, and epidemiologist Brian Weeks tracked data (""I like to make sense of things,"" he says).

Savannah epidemiologist Meredith Avery started working in a small-town pharmacy at 16, and Cristina Pasa Gibson used to take care of laboratory monkeys. The successes or failures of the disease detectives in the two cities hold lessons for those around the world.

During her morning commute from Statesboro, a town that is about an hour's drive from Savannah, Avery listens to Crime Junkie. She has a keen interest in investigations, both criminal and epidemiological, and says that she felt uneasy in the early days of the pandemic and a bit excited too. ""You learn about these things in school,"" says 30-year-old Avery. ""And you think it's never going to happen here.""

Contact tracers in Singapore used CCTV footage to track down people who were exposed to the virus. South Korean authorities constructed ""virtual nets"" around individuals to protect others from the virus, according to the Hill.

But most people in the US baulk at contact-tracing apps, according to a Washington Post-University of Maryland poll, because of privacy concerns.

Thurmond Neill Tillman, a pastor at First African Baptist Church in Savannah, says he understands the need for contact tracing: three people in his congregation have become ill with the virus. But he is concerned about the system's invasive nature. ""I can see how it would be very troubling,"" he says. ""I probably would have hated it as a teenager.""

Image copyright Courtesy of First African Baptist Church Image caption Pastor Thurmond Neill Tillman supports contact tracing but says the system raises privacy issues

Empathy lessons

Detectives are good listeners. They try to win the trust of people, and the ability to put yourself in someone else's shoes is helpful. Cristina Pasa Gibson, 50, says she learned about cultural differences as a five-year-old while visiting her cousin in Manila. They came across an illustration of an egg basket in a colouring book, and her cousin painted one of the eggs dark, making it look like an egg soaked in slaked lime, a snack in the Philippines. ""I said: 'There's no such thing as a purple egg,' and I hit her,"" Gibson says. ""I was such a spoiled brat. That began my introspective journey.""

Outside Manila, Gibson saw families living in poverty, with ramshackle huts as homes, and decided in college to work in public health. The experience she had as a child have helped her in her work fighting the pandemic: she understands that not everyone sees the world in the same way, and they are fighting the virus in different ways too.

Disease detectives are now settling into their roles. Yet the future of the nation and the trajectory of the disease remains unclear. The president is planning to hold rallies this summer, and activists are continuing to protest against police brutality. These mass gatherings pose problems for investigators and contact tracers, who struggle to get in touch with people who have joined the gatherings and may be infected.

The people who are working on the contact-tracing programmes are honest about their limitations. ""From the beginning one of our mantras was: 'We'll do as much as we can for as long as we can,'"" says Yale student Tyler Shelby: ""Everything was unclear and nobody knew what was around the corner. We just accepted that uncertainty. We figured that we're not going to be able to resolve everything, but we're going to do what we can.""

In Savannah, Cristina Pasa Gibson has been calling people to tell them about their Covid-19 test results, a departure from the traditional purview of contact tracing but part of the larger fight against the pandemic. She jokes with her colleagues about setting up metal bells in the office so they can ding them whenever someone on the phone calls out: ""Thank you, Jesus.""

Noele Illien,The Swiss court ruling on home workers’ rent,"A year ago in Switzerland, a Federal Supreme Court ruling about whether companies should help pay remote workers’ rent passed largely unnoticed.

In its decision on 23 April 2019, the nation’s highest court ruled that if an employee is required to work from home, the company must pay a share of the rent. In the case, the part-time employee didn’t have to rent a bigger apartment or incur other additional costs by working remotely, but was entitled to a monthly rent reimbursement of CHF150 ($157, £127) because the company was able to save on office rent.

“The employer has to compensate for the business use of your apartment, if you don’t have a suitable workplace,” explains Martin Müller, a partner and head of employment at Pestalozzi law firm in Switzerland. He compares it to companies reimbursing employees who use their personal car for business purposes. “The employee pays the car insurance, etc., but the law says the employer has to take over a share.”

Although the decision mostly flew under the radar, it’s found renewed relevance in light of Covid-19. With much of Switzerland’s labour force working from home during the pandemic, the ruling has sparked considerable debate. Does it mean that every employee now working from their kitchen table due to Covid-19 should expect to receive a subsidy?

‘Proportional to salary’

Not exactly, says Müller. The ruling does not automatically entitle everyone who works from home to compensation, he explains. A deciding factor is whether an employee has to work remotely or chooses to do so; if you could also work from the office then your rent would not be reimbursed.",2020-07-07,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200707-the-swiss-court-ruling-on-home-workers-rent
Sopan Deb,A W.N.B.A. Owner Clashes With Players on Protests,"It is unclear whether the W.N.B.A. will sanction Loeffler any further. A spokeswoman for the league declined to comment.

But Loeffler has given no indication that she plans on stepping down as owner. Quite the opposite: On Wednesday night, she told Fox News’s Laura Ingraham that she would not be giving up her ownership stake. She also cited so-called “cancel culture” as the reason for the backlash.

“This isn’t about me,” Loeffler said. “This is about every American’s right to speak out. To enjoy free speech and to support whatever cause and not be canceled. We have this cancel culture that is threatening America and the foundation of it is that Americans are afraid to speak out because of the cancel culture. And I am not going to be silenced by it.”

A former high school basketball player, Loeffler took over ownership of the team, along with the philanthropist Mary Brock, in 2011 — forming a rare all-female ownership group in professional sports.

“It was the opportunity to solve that business challenge,” she told CNN of what drew her to the team, while “being a part of the growing movement towards growth in professional women’s sports.”

In 2013, Loeffler’s name was floated as a possible candidate for an open Senate seat in Georgia to replace the retiring Saxby Chambliss, a Republican. With her wealth and outsider status she was seen as a possible boon to a run. She had also been a longtime donor to Republicans. She ultimately passed on running.

But at the end of last year, when Senator Johnny Isakson, Republican of Georgia, announced that he was resigning for health reasons, there was another opportunity. Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, appointed Loeffler to the seat, over the objections of President Trump, who preferred Representative Doug Collins — setting up a contentious special election in November. (For this Georgia election, there is no primary. To win, a candidate must get 50 percent of the vote. If no candidate reaches that threshold, the top two candidates have a runoff. The Rev. Dr. Raphael G. Warnock, is considered to be the top Democrat in the race.)",2020-07-09,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/09/sports/basketball/kelly-loeffler-atlanta-dream-protests.html

David Leonhardt,Opinion | It’s 2022. What Does Life Look Like?,"True, predictions of forthcoming Republican moderation haven’t fared well in recent years. Yet even if they again prove wrong, Democrats may pursue an ambitious agenda by abandoning the Senate filibuster, as many progressives favor, and passing legislation on a majority basis.

That agenda is shaping up to have two defining features. The first is reducing inequality — through higher taxes on the rich, greater scrutiny of big companies, new efforts to reduce racial injustice and more investments and programs for the middle class and poor, including health care, education and paid leave. The second is acting on climate change, which could cause even more global misery than the coronavirus. “Climate change cannot be solved by the private sector,” Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democrats’ minority leader, told me. “People under 45 realize it.”

Mr. Biden may not seem like a history-altering figure, certainly like less of one than Barack Obama did. But he could wind up presiding over a larger scale of political change than Mr. Obama did, for reasons largely independent of the two men themselves.

Ms. Boushey, who runs the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, argues that progressives are better positioned to pass sweeping change in 2021 than they were in 2009, after the financial crisis. Then, the only major policy area in which Democrats had a comprehensive, politically viable plan was health care — and, not coincidentally, it became Mr. Obama’s biggest policy success.

“Although you had this crisis, you didn’t have the ideas that were ready to go,” Ms. Boushey said. Today, by contrast, progressives have spent years working through the details of plans on climate change, high-end tax increases, antitrust policy and more. And while Mr. Obama’s team had only a couple of months to plan for taking office amid a national crisis, Mr. Biden’s team would have almost a year. “There is a whole vision that I think is ready,” Ms. Boushey added. “And there is a lot more runway.”

Mr. Biden and congressional Democrats would need to avoid getting bogged down in intramural squabbles between the center and the left. But the potential exists for the farthest-reaching period of legislative change since Ronald Reagan’s presidency.

In less than 15 years, the United States has suffered the biggest two economic crises since the Great Depression, the worst pandemic in more than a century and the election of two presidents unlike any before them — and diametrically unlike each other. If there is a single lesson of the current era of American politics, it’s that change can happen more quickly than we imagined.

Jordan Salama,Opinion | You Should Start Writing Letters,"It’s been deeply comforting to think that whatever I am writing will soon be in the hands of someone else, especially in a time of so much physical distancing. I’ve sent letters as far as Argentina and South Korea, and as near as only a few blocks from my door. Some of the handwriting I’ve seen, like mine, has been laughably illegible; other letters are aesthetically works of art. One friend, an international student isolating on an otherwise-emptied college campus in New Jersey, enclosed a petal from a blossoming cherry tree. In these pages, I read the smiles I cannot see.

I’m not alone in finding comfort in letter-writing these days. A recent New York Times article reported on the rise in snail mail and handwritten messages; the practice seems to have caught on as people cope with grief from the pandemic. That I’ve only started writing letters now is ironic and sad, too, because the U.S. Postal Service is bleeding. The economic devastation of the pandemic could be the final blow that ends one of our nation’s oldest and most cherished institutions. While an increase in package volume during the first few months of the pandemic is providing temporary relief, no amount of letters we send can make up for the billions in federal funding that are needed to save it.

And yet, as with so many other things these days, I’m holding out hope. A Postal Service survey published in May suggested younger people in particular were more likely to want to send cards and letters during this time. Though that doesn’t mean a lot of us are actually doing it, part of me likes to think there’s some Florentino Ariza out there, writing impassioned letters to the girl he’s not permitted to see.

More likely, it’s because we’re missing our friends and classmates; we’re so badly aching for the simple physical connections that the coronavirus has taken away without a promise of near return. Perhaps it’s because a letter is an unhindered way of working through anxieties, thoughts and emotions during a period of nonstop information and tremendous grief. Perhaps it’s simply a break from a screen or just another way to mark the passage of time when the world seems to be on an indefinite hold.

In that sense, there are plenty of reasons to start writing letters now — not least because there’s something to be said for slowing down. “When I got your letter, the first thing I wanted to do was text you a picture … but I quickly caught myself,” another childhood friend wrote. “What an affront to letter-writing that would have been.” I smiled as I pulled out a blank sheet to start my response. I like to think I’ll keep this up for as long as I can, or at least as long as someone is willing to write back.

Farhad Manjoo,"Opinion | I’ve Seen a Future Without Cars, and It’s Amazing","So it is. It is Friday. I spent several weeks working on this article that posted yesterday about cars and about the future of cities and why the in this time where you might think that you know this would be the wrong time to kind of make a bet on public transportation because people are worried about, oh, me media peeps know t.k. OK So t.k. is out. Well TV decided to come. So that’s Tuesday. So you know, I’ve been thinking for a while. So I love cars. I’m a huge kind of gearhead. Do I look like a gearhead. Really but that’s what I am. I always want I buy cars more often and eat too. I always want cars that are like, cool rather than practical. And whenever we go on vacation like to a new place I always want to kind of like, rent a cool car. I’m a big fan of cars. I grew up in Southern California, which sort of is the reason I think that I’m a big fan of cars that much for his so shiny. This is not a good luck Really. But like in the last few years, I’ve become kind of increasingly disillusioned about cars like that the everywhere in the country traffic has gone traffic is just, like, impossible in New York where I don’t live. But I visit often in Manhattan. Traffic is really kind of at the record low before the virus. The average speed in midtown for four car traffic was five miles per hour, which is slower which is slower than riding a bike and about just a tiny bit faster than walking. And so traffic is one. Number two is like I’ve spent a lot of time following what the tech industry has been doing to kind of improve cars. You know the last decade has been kind of the decade of like cars in the tech industry. So we had Uber, you know in 2009 which kind of led the way to this shared vehicle. Look at cars where you know, you wouldn’t have to own a car, you could just kind of buy fractional time on a car. Eventually you wouldn’t even need the driver there because there’d be self-driving cars and this. And the way that Uber talked about it. And the way that Lyft talked about it was that this would reduce car ownership. And it would reduce traffic in our big cities would be kind of a boon for the environment as well as for consumers because you didn’t have to buy a car, you didn’t have to park a car. You didn’t have to have the worry of you know the hassle of owning a car in a city you just get fractional time on a car in a car. And in fact, you know a lot of people use it. It’s been it’s been extremely popular. But there are several problems with it. One is that it’s like doesn’t seem to be a profitable business. So it doesn’t seem to be economically viable Uber lost 8 billion last year. And so number two, it’s really not great for like labor and drivers. But the third one is that it’s just really increased traffic like in every place where Uber has operated traffic has gone up the gains to kind of aiding carpooling haven’t really paid off. What really happens is that there are previous cars on the road and there are now Uber cars on the road and others are sort of circling and parking everywhere and kind of blocking roads. And so that is increased congestion. The other thing that was going to change the car industry was electric cars. So you know, Tesla has really transformed the car business with its vision of electric cars and they’ve sold a bunch of them. But the idea there was that like. It would spur the rest of the industry to go electric. And that’s not really happening. There are a lot of car companies that announced electrics but they don’t make a lot of money on electrics and so they sort of pause you their developments. Tesla is like you know one of Tesla, if you will, in the market for an electric car today you could get a Chevy Bolt you can get a Nissan leaf. You can get sort of one kind of plug-in hybrid Toyota Prius but really like your options are Tesla and the. So you know it may lead to sort of big change if carmakers kind of join the bandwagon but they make a ton of money on SUVs and a lot of the companies are you know, running their electric programs are called out basically like what people in industry call compliance cars. They’re making electric cars. So they can sell enough of those. So they can like lower their fleet average. So that they can have room to sell a very profitable SUV. So it’s sort of like the electric is like allowing car companies to sell gas guzzler SUVs that are extremely dangerous which are also going to be on the road for like 10 to 20 years. So you know like. And so the estimates for when we could get full electric is like you know of the American fleet is something like 15 to 20 years. So it’s going to be a very, very long time before we turn to electric. And there’s also not not really a electrics are better, more efficient than gas powered cars. But it really depends on how we generate electricity. Some of them are not very good options and also like it takes a lot of materials and takes a lot of energy and it takes a lot of like mining of minerals of you know cup cobalt lithium other things that you need precious resources. So they’re not really like an environmental panacea. You have self-driving cars, which is sort of like the holy grail of the Silicon Valley car industry, which is like we will make cars that don’t hurt people that are super convenient that you don’t even need to drive. That will kind of transform the car industry. And this is the promise they’ve been telling. You know they’ve been this is a vision they’ve been promising us for 10 years and really like the last five it’s been like, oh electric cars will be around the corner. They’re not it’s going to be a long time before we get electric cars everywhere. I mean self-driving cars everywhere. They’re running into lots of kind of human and infrastructure and weather and other problems. And so you know like you can bet that cars are going to be like reliably killing people for the next five to 10 years. It’s not going to change. So I started thinking about this. And I started thinking about like how all of these car industry kind of promises for change and Silicon Valley promises for change. We’re really kind of not really addressing the major problem. The major problem is like we have these vehicles. Now that are killing in America about 90,000 people a year about 40,000 people die in car crashes about 50,000 people die in kind of premature deaths caused by emissions from cars. And you know it’s like all big cities. If you go to areas where there are lots of freeways just around the freeways you can see there’s much higher concentrations of you know breathing problems, asthma lots of problems caused by air pollution. And you know thousands of people Tens of thousands of people are dying every year because of that, we. And so then the coronavirus happened and suddenly overnight around the world, people stopped using cars. But mostly because they were staying at home. But that because there were no cars on the road. People started looking at the streets in different ways. Like in all over the United States there were cities that closed down streets to cars and people started biking biking became see for walking became safer rollerblading became a thing. Skateboarding sales were up and in New York people started using city bike more and something amazing happened with the air pollution everywhere that cars kind of left the streets. You like in New Delhi which has terrible air pollution. People suddenly reported being able to see the blue skies you could see mountains in the distance in Harlem in Manhattan Air pollution fell 20% like toxic air pollution just because of the removal of cars. I mean, you know, you think of Manhattan as a relatively car free place. But you know all around. There’s a toxic air pollution there’s a lot of cars that are stuck in traffic that are causing air pollution in Los Angeles trapped. The air pollution went to record lows not seen in like 2005 years. So it was an amazing change. And I began to think like, why can’t we. Why can’t we keep this. Well, so one reason why you can’t keep it is people are very worried about public transit. So when New York when other cities with transit kind of open up fully. People are worried that the trains are going to be overcrowded. And you may get the virus on there you know by riding transit or a bus. And so it seems like cars are the safest thing. The problem is that cars are not safe. They are actually dangerous. They kill people. And there’s not enough room for them. So you know with Manhattan traffic for example, if it was already at 5 miles per hour. If more people choose to drive. It’s just going to be no one move. So cars, even though they seem like a safe alternative for from the virus standpoint, they’re not really like a good formative to you know, all the other modes of transportation. So what do we do. I started talking to a lot of urban planners and people who think about. And if the future of mobility and in particular, I started talking to v Sean chucker party who is a former urban planning official in New York City who runs this architecture firm in Manhattan he’s the incoming dean of the architecture school at Berkeley. And he and his firm had been putting together this really, really intricate proposal looking at all of the benefits you could get if we took over the space that you use in Manhattan for cars and gave it to other more accessible forms of transportation and cheaper forms of transportation. So you know, if you so that the number the thing that really wanted to focus on was the kind of amount of space that we give to cars in cities. So, you know, it’s everyone knows like cars are dangerous. Everyone knows cars are expensive cars are bad for the environment. I think a lot of people don’t look at how much space cars use in our big cities. And you know we America’s major cities are the most precious resource is is like physical space. You know in San Francisco and Los Angeles and New York in d.c. and kind of many, many major kind of economic hubs. Housing is super expensive, because there’s not a lot of supply there because there’s not a lot of room and you have like restrictive zoning laws that prevent building. And so you have limited land supply and also people have to commute in from really far away, because you know we’re not building dense. And because because of cars kind of feed sprawl and so you have people living really far away because housing costs. You have people commuting very far. The removal of cars like giving up some of that space that we use for cars and using it for other things like housing better transportation could just revolutionize cities. If you just think about the amount of space that cars use and how better. We could use them. I think a lot of people understand that you know this is not cars are not the most efficient use of space. But I really wanted to figure out how to show that I mean, a lot of people have been talking about this. But so I started talking to v Sean and three of the other architects there about like the gains that we could get from banning cars in the most obvious place to start to look at ways is Manhattan because New York is already one of the most kind of car fleet free places in the country. It’s one of the few places where most people don’t own cars. So in New York City about 48 47% of people own households own cars. So like is a majority non-current car owning city in Manhattan. It’s something like 75% of residents don’t own cars. And the people who do own cars. I got a lot of pushback on this saying, you know this is going to be bad for lower income people to ban cars. But in fact, like that. If you look at any kind of stat about car owners car drivers. They are wealthier than non car owners in every part of New York City. And so you know it’s a real. It’s sort of an interesting thing where the city is giving up this vast tracts of land to relatively wealthy people who are driving for their own kind of convenience and pleasure. And that land is not really being kind of paid for in any way. You know all the things you think of as like a charge on cars like gas taxes and tolls and stuff really don’t cover the building of roads and the space devoted to roads. And so it’s really kind of like a gift of all this precious land to car users to car drivers. And so like how better to use that space. And so Sean and his team came up with these really this really amazing plan for how much better life in New York could be if Manhattan alone banned not all motor vehicles. But just private cars. So there could still be Uber there could still be lifts there could still be delivery trucks there could still be emergency vehicles there could still be a lot of people said that I didn’t sort of mention problems for disabled people. But there could be you know Paratransit would every other form of. And you know accessible public transit every other form of transportation with the absence of cars would be made better. And what do I mean by better. I mean faster better, more availability better service. So last year Manhattan closed parts of 14th Street to car traffic and in order to make the 14th Street as in lower Manhattan and in order to make bus Crosstown bus service much faster. So it used to take something like 40 minutes to get across town. And now it’s like half that because there’s no cars. And that would be that’s sort of the gain you get from cars. So from giving up space to cars. So instead of, you know all Manhattan residential streets pretty much all of them have street parking on the side and a lane of car traffic in the middle. And the bigger roads have several lanes of car traffic plus street parking. Plus a lot of like medians and other kind of safety features you need in the road to prevent cars from hitting everyone else. If you remove that space, which is the space devoted to cars in Manhattan is something like a third of the island’s space, which is an incredible amount. If you remove that space from cars you could have room for bus rapid transit, which is like a bus system where it goes has dedicated lanes has platforms for people to get in on buses really goes much faster. You can have bus rapid transit across Manhattan and from on the bridges and tunnels coming into Manhattan. So you know if you’re in one of the kind of bedroom communities around New York City. If you live in one of the outer Boroughs you could come into the city either on public transit or in either on trains or in something like bus rapid transit which would you know connect to outer Boroughs. And like further off. Right and the plans would also include Uber and taxis would also be available on the island. And the other thing that you would get space for would be big sort of two lane protected bike lanes on pretty much every street in Manhattan. And you don’t the streets those lanes don’t have to be used for bikes. There’s all these new sort of micro mobility devices, things people hate like scooters and an electric skateboards. But the reason people hate those is because they’re taking up. They’re taking up sidewalk space. Now because there’s not. And people hate them because they’re running into pedestrians. But if there was more space for bikes and there was more space for pedestrians and less space for cars those other things wouldn’t seem as annoying either. People are annoyed by scooters because they’re just like littering the sidewalk. But if they didn’t have to litter the sidewalk and then were sidewalks bigger you know, even scooters would be sort of better. So they should have like every everything in favor like you look at this plan and it’s really hard to think of a downside for people. Even a downside for the car driver. So one thing they found in coming up with this kind of plan for no cars in New York is you remove cars from Manhattan bus service becomes so fast it becomes sort of as fast as the subway. So you can get from uptown downtown in something like 20 to 30 minutes you could get you know like trips that used to take two hours on buses get down to like 30 minutes you get huge gains for the speed of buses you know, coming into the island from you know the outer Boroughs or in cities in the cities around New York would be cut dramatically that the amount of time people spend on the ride. So it’s even better for people who do drive cars one of the things we noticed they noticed in the plan is like if you ban cars from Manhattan. There will be so much less traffic around Manhattan that like if you started even trips that didn’t involve Manhattan. So like if you went from one place in Brooklyn by car to another place in Brooklyn by car or the Bronx for example, you get less traffic on those routes because all the traffic going sort of clogging up the outer Boroughs through and through on the way to Manhattan is not there. So you know even if you’re a car driver who doesn’t drive in Manhattan you’ll get better traffic. And then the public health benefits are amazing in Manhattan as a result. By banning cars you get a 50% reduction in toxic pollution. And in the outer Boroughs where there’s a lot of pollution because there’s a lot of cars kind of sitting on the road idling on the roads you get a 20% reduction in toxic air pollution. So you kill fewer people by accidents you kill fewer people by air pollution and you get around faster and it’s cheaper, it’s more accessible for people on at every income scale. You don’t have to have you know money to buy a car to maintain a car to sort of live in access like the economy of New York. To me, it was just like a home run sale. And so we came up with this way of showing all these benefits in in graphical form. In the article, and it it really resonated and got a lot of it. I feel like, you know a of people have written about burning cars in various parts of the country and in New York specifically in Manhattan. People have been calling for banning cars since the 60s. What I really thought was interesting about this model from fission is that it had just a lot of kind of detail. And it shows off the benefits that you would get. OK So I got a lot of comments criticisms about it. I’m going to go through them. We can talk about the issue. If you have any thoughts to you can or questions you can write them random right here. OK So on Twitter Kevin de good said, we cannot simply assume this change would be uniformly beneficial for residents of every age and ability level as of 2018. Only 119 of two. So 25 percent of New York subways were fully accessible. New Jersey Transit is a bit better, but not much rate like this would require an improvement of public transit generally for accessibility but also just for capacity like if there are no cars more people would need to use the subway and the buses and everything else. And you wouldn’t need you would have to. It would have to come after like a long build out of infrastructure. So this is like the cost of it. We have to change the roads we’d have to change the creative bus rapid transit system. And you have to make sure those are accessible and accessible for four disabled people, but also accessible in terms like economically accessible. This is like I think a lot of people are skeptical about just the idea of relying on public transportation because public transportation in every major city and in particular and in New York with the subways has been like underfunded badly managed like compared to lots of other parts of the world. Public transportation is not great in America and like it’s a hard sell to say, well, you can get rid of cars, but like you’ll have to rely on the buses when the buses aren’t great like the kind of current way that people understand how buses work is not like a picture of like speed and efficiency. And so it’s a leap of a kind of a leap of faith and you’d really need to have a plan for creating alternatives. And I think that’s the real difficulty in life. I think that could be sort of one source of pushback as like there’s not a lot of alternatives for public transportation and so you need to build those first. And I think that’s a good criticism ds nip I have from Twitter said so I’m all for Greening cities. But this is not the moment to take the option of car travel from urbanites especially those of us who are older have underlying health conditions or other covered related reasons may not feel safe getting back on the train right. Yeah, like the train. It’s true like the train seems like a dangerous place like indoor overcrowding is not good in this pandemic. And you have a lot of people on the train with a lot of people in buses. That sounds bad. It is not clear that there have been any kind of super spreading events from subways or transit in general in any part of the world. There’s no sort of obvious link in New York for the high cases tying it to transit many, many places in the world have huge transit systems and really didn’t suffer huge coronavirus related outbreaks and then you know, the idea here is that you would rapidly expand the buggy would significantly expand the number about the capacity of these systems. And so you would have more trains and you would have more buses and you would have more pedestrian space in order to allow people to kind of be not so closely packed in. But this requires infrastructure. And I can see why people would be worried about it like it, it does seem unsafe especially when there’s just not a lot of capacity on current systems. So that’s another thing where you would need to kind of balance people’s risk by increasing capacity and making sort of bigger changes. And I can see how people wouldn’t really I don’t know trust for that to happen like it’s just really hard to believe that under and under managed cities, cities that to have an end like government at every level in America seems kind of not to be doing a great job recently. So I can see how people would be skeptical that it would happen. Nick in Brooklyn said something similar, which is covered. There’s no way I’m hopping on mass transit anytime remotely soon in fact, we’re renting a car just so I can avoid trains so as to protect against bringing something home to my newborn and aging mother until adequate investment is made. So I don’t have to stand in someone’s armpit for 20 minutes on the downtown for during rush hour. No thanks. Yeah, I mean, I hear you. I feel like if the trains are extremely overcrowded now it might make sense to get a car. But like if everyone gets a car No one’s going to move. I think there’s a real sort of like traffic was already at really an unsustainable levels before. And so if more people get cars. I don’t think you’re going to have kind of an easy or better way to get into the city. This seems like a time to kind of dump you know increase our investment in public transit because that’s the only way to efficiently move millions of people cars. Really can’t do it. Like if everyone in New York had a car. It would not be there would be no space for anything else. If everyone in New York drove, and you made enough room on the roads for everyone in New York to drive there would be nothing else like there’s just physically not enough room in New York for everyone to drive a car. And that’s true in every city. It’s true even in Los Angeles. Like a lot you know a place where lots of people drive. But like not everyone drives and you know a lot of people in major cities take public transit and the fact that it’s getting worse and pushing people to driving is going to make traffic just like untenable in lots of places. So I really don’t think we have a real option here. In a lot of these changes are not any way going to happen before you know immediately. And so it’s possible. We have a vaccine or other things for it to allow for public transportation Karen in Des Moines said, thank you for doing the math on this. It makes the argument even more compelling. I think another point to be made is that as the country ages older adults need city spaces where they can safely walk run errands and socialize. I hope Manhattan paves the way for such a plan. Yeah, I think that’s also the other thing that I noticed doing during Katrina virus is that like the outdoors without cars. It just became kind of psychologically safer life. I noticed that I was just like walking on the streets because there were. You wanted to social distance and the streets near where I live. We’re not like officially closed down. But there were so few cars that you could kind of walk on the roads in residential areas. And it felt like you had this whole new like sort of landscape that you hadn’t thought of as like belonging to people. It belonged to cars. And now now it suddenly was given back to the people and you and you had some sort of sense of like it was like liberation. I didn’t worry all the time. That is going to run off the road and get onto the sidewalk and hit my kids, which is something I think about often because you know what actually does happen like cars kill 40,000 people a year. And we just kind of conveniently forget about it because because like it’s too hard to think about. We said, we think like should realize the cost and the damage can be caused by cars and they try to mitigate that. So yeah, I really thought that there was like some really a big change in how I thought about the city. And how about that. In the end like the possibility of the city. When When cars were gone. I should say like a lot of people responded and sat and asked like what should we do about this. How should we make this reality. And it’s not going to be easy at all. This is like people have been calling for an end to cars in Manhattan for a very long time. And in the case for it has always been really good. And it’s like there is a political kind of constituency sort of really loyal to cars. And then there’s also this like kind of all this cultural baggage like you know for 100 years. The car industry has been spending on ads and kind of cultural propaganda and that’s what I call it. Like all of these movies that kind of feature cars that like put cars at the center of our world, like in America cars just have like the kind of physical landscape of the other country is kind of built around cars and like it’s really hard to escape that idea that we don’t need cars that cars could be like a outdated technology that we don’t need to improve on upon them. We need to kind of move beyond them. I think it’s a really hard case in all of America, and even in a even in a car food place like Manhattan. But I feel like you know, we’ve seen this movement in the last few years of cities pulling back land from cars and like the livability increasing enough that like there’s really a lot of kind of popularity around these changes, like the pedestrian is the pedestrian of like lots of places of in New York’s times square being turned into a pedestrian plaza 14th Street in San Francisco market street no longer allows cars in Paris they’ve pulled away. They’ve reduced the amount of like they’ve pulled lock lots of roads and other parts of the city away from cars and there’s been a 40% reduction in traffic in the past decade just an amazing decline and like that has been a really effective way to change how people think about cars. And I think that’s like there’s room in the political and the politics for us to push that. What about self-driving cars. I mean self-driving cars are not a thing. They just like they work in very limited circumstances. Google has a trial in Arizona where it’s always sunny and there’s sort of few weather disturbances and there’s big suburbs and like there the roads are make sort of relative sense. But in other places and lots of other places, there’s just it’s just not viable. And it’s going to be a long time before it’s like works. And you know further away it gets further away every year. Car companies were promising kind of self-driving cars for sale in 2020. That is not happening. I would be surprised if you could buy a self-driving car before 2025. And it’s a complicated thing and it has to kind of interface with humans on the road with pedestrians and do so in a way that doesn’t cause like unnecessary like doesn’t cause deaths doesn’t cause danger. But also doesn’t sort of change the culture of the road and a lot in big ways. And I just think that we shouldn’t kind of bet on the future of self-driving cars as a way to free us from the problem of cars and electric cars have a whole bunch of similar problems right. Like they’re just they cost a lot to produce. They cost a lot of kind of resources to produce and other than Tesla just know a few car companies are really betting on it anymore. They’re all doing it to just get compliance with them with gas mileage standards. So that they can sell a better, more SUV like that’s sort of the whole business model of the car industry because SUV is or where the money is so and those SUV are going to be on the road for more than a decade. So I just feel like we have to do something we really can’t afford to wait until we get self-driving cars and they’re not going to be like the obvious kind of panacea. They’re not going to solve all the problems. And in particular, they’re not going to solve the problem of space like the car is an electric car or a self-driving car. Like self-driving cars may be able to pack in closer to each other on roads on freeways and so maybe you’d have less traffic. But that’s like a fairly long term goal you’d need a lot of the cars to be self driving for that to happen. Just kind of in the short run. Like a single electric car doesn’t solve the space problem. You still need to pocket you. It still takes up a lot of room on the road. It still requires things like parking garages street parking and it’s still super inefficient like one of the things that I was really eye opening in writing about this was that. But just in a given amount of space in a city cars are just way less efficient in terms of how much room they use to transport people like you can pack you know, 50 people on a city bus and transport that and you move 50 people on one city bus, which has a square footage of like 500 square feet or something less like a studio apartment. If you wanted to move 50 people in cars like most cars have just one or two people you’re looking at like 30 to 50 cars 30 to 50 cars, which take up, you know like many, many more times the amount of space just on the road. And then if you account for like the amount of space. They take a parking lot gets just a very, very inefficient way of moving people around compared to buses and buses are really like we in America are not fans of buses like buses are seen as like I don’t know old technology, not the way you’d want to travel. That’s just not the case in Europe. I went to London recently. And you know London has like world famous buses that are really super convenient. You can get anywhere on a bus like I went to London for six days did not travel on a car any kind of car not even a taxi in anytime in a week in the week. You could go on a subway or on the bus. The buses are not as fast as they could be because there are still cars in London. But there are fewer cars than elsewhere because they have congestion pricing. If they had no cars in London buses would be even sort of e just even better. But like you can get a lot of places very quickly on a bus in London because the buses are nice and they move quickly and they have like a lot of capacity. And we can easily do that in a big American cities. In San Francisco in New York in Los Angeles like in Los Angeles, where the bus system is not great, but lots of people use it because they can’t afford a car because like you need some kind of few motor vehicle to get around Los Angeles because that’s how the city is designed. If you just complain young gave a ton of money to the bus system and like had buses everywhere you would it would just be just amazing thing for us for lower income people for older people or for disabled people who feel just like a lot of people in the city who don’t have the access and means that wealthy car drivers do. And we are really like one thing. I sort of realized in reporting on this is like city officials and kind of even citizens are just really stuck in the mindset of why cars are the way to get around. Until very recently in many parts of the country you were required if you built a building if you built any other kind of structure you were required to prove to create space for cars. Yeah, that’s insane. Like no other system in no other system of transportation gets like a gimme in the law and says like you will. We will require this form of transportation, but we won’t require like bike lanes. We won’t require like you know bus stops everywhere. It’s just like insane. We an end and the way we the reason we do that is because cars are so space inefficient that you have to like it. The only way the car industry sort of took over the roads was by making the car like the default alternative the default way of traveling and then it just sort of it’s like a contagion really like every car that one person buys. You need to create enough roads space for it. And you need to create enough parking space for it. And as soon as you create the road space in the parking space that’s its only can be used by cars. You create and you create demand for people to buy cars. And then you need more space for the people buying cars. It’s a cycle that ends in every part of our cities being covered in like paved roadway and so the only way to break that cycle is to pull land away from the cause. Like you you are if the worse you make try driving the more inconvenient and expensive. You make driving the better everything else becomes. And yeah. I just think I don’t like cars. Do you have any other questions than this. Should we move on from cars. The other thing I’m really freaking out about is schools, whether they should open whether they should not. What we’re going to do in the fall about schools. I have two kids who are in elementary school. Elementary school age. They were home for like from March onward. They’ve been home. My wife and I worked full time. We’ve worked full time from home and we work full time from home during the pandemic. And so it’s like two parents and two children in the house while with no childcare. Other than us while we’re working. And it’s just was an impossible situation. And I cannot leave. We have to do that again, because we were so bad as a country, as a society in fighting this virus and now we have to our school. I think our school is going to be opened three days a week or two days a week and then the other days of the week, the kids will be at home. So that like you can have social distancing and you could have staggered schedules and I will just not get any work done like I will probably do these Twitter chats because that’s the only thing I can do while my kids are home because like it’s really difficult to get any leg sustained work done. So don’t expect columns from me. I really am though I really am like, I have no idea what we’re going to do in the fall not just me, but I mean, everyone like I just have no idea how society is going to function with home with like massive required home schooling that the real problem is like there’s no, we haven’t like the places that have opened up schools have really opened up schools only when there was no kind of community spread of the virus, or there was reduced community spread of the virus. And so the science on this like our schools safe when there’s so much of the virus going around. We don’t really know like there’s much lower transmissibility among kids and kids get less sick from the virus, but they could. But like if there’s a contagion and they get it and they get pass it to other people in their household. To me to my wife to my parents. And so it really makes it a scary thing like it. It works. It works to open schools when there is no kind of free floating contagion. But when or when you’ve reduced it. But no wonder the 30 has died from Cobain. That’s not true. And it sort of is and it isn’t even on point rate. Even if people no one under 30 has died. People under 30 are back in contact with people over 30. And so you even if they don’t even if my kids don’t get sick from the virus. They could bring it to other people. And that’s super scary for me and for my other the rest of my family. And it’s really opening the schools are not opening the schools like there’s no real there’s no real good decision here. Like the only answer. The only answer is for us to have done a better job four months ago, and we miss that chance. And now we’re just like as a country, you no good options. I’m an immigrant to the United States and like I I’m like, I have been in like them in. I don’t know like a love affair with the United States for much of my life like. I feel incredibly grateful for coming here. I feel like the country changed my life and gave me opportunities. But I am more have less faith in the future of America than I ever have had. Like it’s just I feel like it. Like at the point where life people who can should try to figure out like if there’s another place to go in the world that might be better at handling crises that are going to be caused by like a changing planet that are going to be caused by like disease that are going to be caused like economic crises like we are just like our government at that at the federal level. And it’s to mean, it doesn’t even have to be a partisan thing like just like the entire system of government is not working like Congress can’t pass anything the president doesn’t seem to be have a plan for anything. And then at various parts of this. And like you know we’ve had real successes of like federalism in this country on the virus like some places have done a lot better than others, but like it doesn’t really save you because people have freedom of movement in the United States. And it’s really difficult like we’re all in this together until and so I don’t really think like being in California, where there may be better government can save you from like a whole lot because you know people from elsewhere can come here. It’s just like a problem that having to do with like the fundamental parts of our society. And I just really don’t know how we’re going to change that. I wrote a column a few weeks ago saying like I am more pessimistic about the future than I ever was before. Like it’s time to go full Duma and like I am more full Duma than I was even a few weeks ago when I wrote that. So I don’t know. Is there like deep doo like I felt like there was you know maybe four or five weeks ago, there seemed to be a light at the end of this tunnel for coronavirus. We seem to be going in the right direction. If we just kind of stuck with mitigation efforts but we didn’t blink. We just like the kind of slavish Ness toward capitalism. It’s just crazy. Like people had to reopen. People had to. Even if it was not like even if there were clear dangers like people just had to go get their haircuts and had to go to bars. It doesn’t seem to me that we open bars before we open schools y and end like that impatience the inability to do something to sacrifice for the greater good. And the sacrifices you are small there. You know there are like like things like even small sacrifices like wearing masks like it’s just becomes like a huge culture war controversy that we have a difficulty even like coming up with like rational responses. The way other societies do like. It’s just it just feels like we are not doing a good job as a populace as a society as a political body dealing with crises. And it’s not I mean, it’s just happened for like time and time again, like we responded badly to 9/11 but going into an unnecessary war. We responded badly to the great recession and that we kept the banks alive. But we didn’t really like bailout ordinary citizens from like loss of life, and we didn’t like stimulate the economy to the degree that we could have. And you know we’re going to fail this we’re failing this like what. When a country is repeatedly sort of given huge crises and sort of fails to stop them. And makes life worse for most of its population think I don’t really know what you how you fix that. We seem to be in sort of like an intractable paralysis regarding like fixing problems. And it’s like radically dispiriting to think about. So you can thank the electoral college for so much of those failures. Yeah I mean, the electoral college the I think the Senate is worse. Like the fact that we have kind of minority rule in the Senate the way that that minority rule in the Senate shapes the courts, the way that just like voting. And like every other part of the sort of federal apparatus is designed to kind of frustrate majority rule. It’s just like there’s lots of problems in. We don’t have a real solution to any of them. Indoor bars have now shown to be a major source of Super Spinner events and should be shut down. I mean, it’s crazy to me that even people opened up bars. I saw that some places were closing. Movie studios and like, why were the movies like movie like movie theaters like, why were the theaters like open in the first place. It’s just insane that we kind of move so quickly to doing that. OK, I’ve been talking about cars and the virus for nearly an hour. We’re really quickly. I just talk and talk. I got to say who’s coming up next week. Jen senior on Monday at 1:00 PM eastern 10 AM Pacific on the NIT opinion channel Tuesday. Nobody’s set yet. We will see Wednesday. Kara swisher Thursday Nick Christophe and Friday me again and again next week. So thanks so much for joining me. Good luck with this terrible time in our country. Good luck on the virus. Good luck with everything else. Talk to you later. Cars of the west.",2020-07-09,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/09/opinion/sunday/ban-cars-manhattan-cities.html
Amna A. Akbar,"'Defund the Police,' 'Cancel Rent': The Left Remakes the World - The New York Times","The uprisings have also expanded the space for a reckoning with the failures of liberal reforms and with the possibility of doing things in radically different ways. Tinkering and training cannot fix our reliance on police officers to deal with routine social problems through violence and the threat of it.

The demand for defunding calls into question the fundamental premise of policing: that it produces safety. It urges us to take collective responsibility for collective care, repair and redress. It shifts our vantage point on persistent problems: for example, to guarantee housing for all rather than to continue to arrest and cage this country’s more than 567,000 homeless people.

The call to defund the police is often accompanied by a call to shift resources elsewhere, to education, housing and health care. The pandemic has put on display the spectacular contradiction such appeals reveal. We have no guaranteed health care, wages, housing or food; we can’t even provide personal protective equipment. These failures have devastated Black communities in particular.

But then, in response to Black Lives Matter protests, the police show up in high-tech gear and military-style vehicles to arrest, gas and bludgeon protesters, demonstrating where our tax dollars have gone instead. The demand for defunding shifts power and our imaginations away from the police and toward a society rooted in collective care for ordinary people. It brings into sharp relief who we have allowed ourselves to become and offers a vision for who we could be.

Taking money away from the police is not the sole demand. Consider the push to cancel rent. It asks the state to abolish tenants’ obligations to pay their landlords each month. But rent is the product of a private contract about private property: the foundation of our social, economic and political order.

So when organizers make the demand to cancel rent, they are conjuring up a state whose primary allegiance is to people’s needs instead of profit. The demand raises the possibility of a world where housing is an entitlement rather than a commodity. It aims to shift power from landlords to tenants, in the service of visions of housing for all.

Or consider the environment. The Green New Deal does not merely call for less pollution. It requires that we restructure our economy so we can move to clean, renewable energy sources and net-zero greenhouse gas emissions.",2020-07-11,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/11/opinion/sunday/defund-police-cancel-rent.html
