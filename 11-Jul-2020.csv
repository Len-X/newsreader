Louis Casiano,"A group of Norman, Okla., residents have launched a recall effort to oust the city's mayor and half the City Council over budget cuts to the police department and her order that people wear masks in public to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.

The group ""Unite Norman"" was borne out of frustration with a June 17 City Council vote to divert $865,000 -- or 3.6 percent -- of police funds to community development programs to track police overtime and to fund an internal auditor position. The vote was taken after a contentious 11-hour meeting held amid nationwide protests over the death of George Floyd and calls to reign in police misconduct.

In a series of tweets, Mayor Breea Clark called the grounds for the recall alleged in the petition ""false and baseless.""

Four of Norman's eight City Council members being targeted are Ward 1 representative Kate Bierman, Ward 3 representative Alison Petrone, Ward 5 representative Sereta Wilson and Ward 7 representative Stephen Holman.

The group says it has a bipartisan agenda with the goal of removing ""divisive and radical figures"" in an effort to ""to return Norman to the center politically,"" according to its Facebook page.

""We are trying to get rid of radicals,"" group member Russell Smith told KWTV-DT. ""This has nothing to do with Democrat or Republican, left or right. We want to center the ship here in Norman.""

Group members were also upset with Clark's decision to mandate the wearing of masks following an uptick in coronavirus cases. She was further criticized for keeping some businesses and houses of worship closed.

As of Friday, Norman, the third-largest city in the state, reported 637 COVID-19 cases and 23 deaths.

The petition to oust Clark would require the collecting of at least 18,125 signatures -- or 25 percent of registered voters to move forward, The Oklahoman reported. Signatures to oust the councilmembers would require significantly less since they represent portions of the city.

Joshua Nelson,"Goya Foods President and CEO Bob Unanue said on Friday that he is not backing down in the face of a boycott over his visit to the White House.

“We were part of a commission called the White House Hispanic Prosperity Initiative and they called on us to be there to see how we could help opportunities within the economic and educational realm for prosperity among Hispanics and among the United States,” Unanue told ""Fox & Friends.""

Unanue said that the United States is the second-largest Hispanic country in the world behind Mexico.

GOYA PRESIDENT: SALES 'QUADRUPLED' AMID CORONAVIRUS DEMAND

Politicians and celebrities are boycotting Goya, the largest Hispanic-owned food company in the country, after its CEO, Robert Unanue, praised President Donald Trump during an event Thursday at the White House.

""We're all truly blessed at the same time to have a leader like President Trump, who is a builder,"" said Unanue, who is of Spanish descent, at the event.

Trump hosted Hispanic leaders at the White House on Thursday and signed an executive order on the White House Hispanic Prosperity Initiative to use more taxpayer support for private and charter schools and “improve access by Hispanic Americans to education and economic opportunities.”

Critics like Rep. Alexandria-Ocasio Cortez, D-N.Y., former Democratic presidential candidate Julian Castro of Texas and a number of celebrities took aim at the company on social media with hashtags like #BoycottGoya and #GOYAWAY. Many urged people who use Goya products to start buying similar foods and condiments produced by the company's competitors.

Unanue called the pushback against him visiting the White House “suppression of speech.” Unanue said that he was previously invited to the White House for an event hosted by the Obama administration for Hispanic Heritage Month.

“So, you’re allowed to talk good or to praise one president, but you’re not allowed to aid in economic and educational prosperity? And you make a positive comment and all of a sudden, it is not acceptable,” Unanue said.

Unanue said he is not apologizing for his remarks supporting Trump's economic policy and would not turn down other future invitations.

Brie Stimson,"Sports leagues and players have turned racial justice issues into a “circus” by focusing more on who’s kneeling or what message is written on players’ jerseys rather than real change, basketball Hall of Famer Charles Barkley said Friday.

“I think we’re missing the point,” the former 76ers, Suns and Rockets star told CNBC. “We need police reform, we need prison reform. ... My concern is turning this into a circus instead of trying to do some good stuff.”

""My concern is turning this into a circus instead of trying to do some good stuff."" — Charles Barkley

The media contributes to the ""circus"" by focusing on kneeling and messages on buses and jerseys, he added.

What the country really needs, he said, was ""good cops out here policing the bad cops.""

He pointed out that while the U.S. is a divided country, ""sports used to be a place where fans could go get away from reality.""

CHARLES BARKLEY: 'CATASTROPHIC MISTAKE' IF NBA CANCELS REST OF SEASON OVER CORONAVIRUS

And as fans financially struggle during the coronavirus pandemic, “they don’t want to see a bunch of rich people” constantly talking about social justice issues, he said.

As more players have started to kneel for the national anthem amid Black Lives Matter protests that have swept the country, NBA players will be allowed to have anti-racism messages on the backs of their jerseys, CNBC reported.

But Barkley was skeptical about how fans will respond as NBA and other games resume this summer.

“The last thing they want to do is turn on the television and hear arguments all the time. It’s going to be very interesting to see how the public reacts,"" he said.

On the coronavirus, Barkley said, “you’d have to be a fool” to think children would be safe in a classroom, adding that it’s not fair to put kids in that situation -- at least until there’s a vaccine.

He added, however, that keeping kids out of school would ""magnify"" the disparity between rich and poor kids because disadvantaged children don't always have the resources such as internet to continue their education remotely.

He added that he hopes NBA games can go forward soon because the economic loss if games are canceled would be so great.

Dom Calicchio,"Lyda Krewson, the embattled mayor of St. Louis -- who has faced repeated protests over the past two weeks -- won’t be stepping down anytime soon, her spokesman said Friday.

Communication Director Jacob Long issued the statement Friday morning, after work crews were seen trying to remove the message “RESIGN LYDA RESIGN,” which had been painted in the street outside City Hall overnight between Thursday and Friday, according to reports.

“Mayor Krewson is not distracted by any of this and remains focused on what she was elected to do: addressing the needs of more than 300,000 St. Louisans who are counting on her to help get them through multiple public health and economic crises, including a worldwide pandemic,” Long said, according to KSDK-TV of St. Louis.

Also Friday morning, police cleared an ""Occupy City Hall STL"" camp that gathered outside the building, The Riverfront Times reported. Protesters had planned to stay until Krewson stepped down, the report said.

Krewson, 66, a Democrat and native of Iowa who has been mayor of St. Louis since April 2017, has been under fire since a Facebook Live briefing in late June, when she read the names and partial addresses of at least 10 protesters who called for the city to defund the police.

The mayor later apologized for reading the information and for causing “distress or harm to anyone,” but also noted the names and addresses were already “public information.”

A group of protesters who claimed to be heading to Krewson’s home June 28 prompted St. Louis couple Mark and Patricia McCloskey to take up arms that day, fearing damage to their property as the protesters passed by.

The couple has been the subject of an investigation since then, and on Friday night had one of their weapons seized by authorities executing a search warrant at their home, KSDK reported.

It wasn’t immediately clear if the McCloskeys were charged with any crimes.

Victor Garcia,"Trump 2020 campaign national press secretary Hogan Gidley told ""Hannity"" Friday that the president's decision to commute former associate Roger Stone's prison sentence was ""a good move.""

""Listen, so many people, so many good people, were caught up in this Russian hoax,"" Gidley told guest host Jason Chaffetz. ""And this was perpetrated by overzealous Democrats, partisan hacks trying to take down a president.

""We now know the campaign was spied upon, wiretapped, authorized by the previous administration,"" he added. ""We wouldn't know, if Donald Trump hadn't been elected, that [former FBI Director James] Comey and [former Director of National Intelligence James] Clapper and [ former CIA Director John] Brennan were all lying in front of Congress.

""And in other ways, we wouldn't know the names Lisa Page and Peter Strzok, the two lovers that conspired to take down a president with an insurance policy,"" Gidley went on. ""We wouldn't know any of that had Donald Trump not been elected.

BIDEN PUSHES POPULIST 'MADE IN AMERICA' PLAN TO PUMP UP ECONOMY

""Now we do, and I think the president's doing the right thing by trying to right some of the wrongs of the partisanship of the past,"" Gidley concluded.

The White House announced Friday evening that Trump had commuted the ""unjust sentence"" of Stone, just days before the longtime political operative was slated to report to prison to serve more than three years for charges stemming from former Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation.

Gidley also discussed Trump's claim that presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden “plagiarized” parts of his economic plan from the president, hinting at past accusations that have dogged the former vice president.

""He plagiarized a couple of words from the president's past, but he's plagiarizing the policies from socialists like Bernie Sanders and [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez] and Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib, Elizabeth Warren,"" Gidley said. ""His policies are going to be so detrimental to this country.""

""We don't have to guess what a Biden economy looks like,"" the press secretary went on. ""We just lived through it for the past eight years, 850,000 jobs lost just from NAFTA alone, 70,000 manufacturing plants closed. Millions of jobs lost because of his relationship with China, because of his defense of China.

""We also don't have to guess how our cities and streets would look if Joe Biden were president,"" Gidley added. ""We saw rioters and looters drag innocent Americans just trying to defend their businesses out into the streets, beat them within an inch of their lives, left to lie in a pool of their own blood.

""Joe Biden said nothing when churches were burned, when stores were looted ... He said nothing about that. So you don't have to guess what would happen in this country. We've already seen it happen.""

Nick Givas,"A surge of coronavirus cases in Florida has maxed out dozens of intensive care units (ICUs) at hospitals around the state, following an attempt by local officials to institute a phased reopening of the economy.

Over 40 hospitals are now hitting their limit with regard to ICU capacity, according to a CNBC News report.

This news comes on the same day that Florida reportedly announced its second-highest one-day COVID-19 infection rate.

“We’re putting ourselves at risk and other people aren’t willing to do anything and in fact go the other way and be aggressive to promote the disease,” Dr. Andrew Pastewski, who serves as ICU medical director at Jackson South Medical Center, told Reuters. ""It’s just disheartening.""

Palm Beach County school board member Marcia Andrews told the Palm Beach Post that local officials are ill-equipped to handle the current uptick in confirmed cases and were caught flat-footed by the resurgence.

“We’re truly not ready,” she said. “We’re not ready from a health standpoint. And we’re not ready from a planning standpoint.”

Florida health officials announced on Sunday that more than 200,000 people in the state had tested positive for COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic.

President Trump has maintained, however, that as testing capabilities increase numbers may seemingly spike, but most patients will still make a full recovery or remain asymptomatic.

Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, said earlier this week that he believed the state has “stabilized” but that he would still like to see the numbers get back to where they were in May and early June.

Adam Shaw,"President Trump on Friday, in a roundtable meeting with Venezuelan expatriates in Florida, took aim at Democrats -- calling them “the party of socialism and worse” as he seeks to draw a distinction on issues such as funding law enforcement and tearing down statues.

“Republicans are the party of freedom, Democrats are the party of socialism and worse,” he said.

TRUMP ACCUSES BIDEN OF 'PLAGIARIZING' HIM OVER 'BUY AMERICAN' PUSH

Speaking to Venezuelan nationals who fled the socialist regime of dictator Nicolas Maduro, Trump then described presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden as a “puppet” being used by radical left-wing activists who want to tear down statues of historic figures and who want to impose socialism.

“Now Joe Biden and the radical left are trying to impose the same system -- socialism plus -- in America,” he said. ""Biden is a puppet of Bernie Sanders, AOC, the militant left, people who want to rip down statues and monuments to George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, Jesus.""

It comes as Trump has sought to draw a contrast between himself and former Vice President Biden and the Democrats on cultural and social questions that have been part of a fiery debate in recent weeks -- such as whether to tear down statues of past American leaders, and about defunding police departments.

Trump accused Biden--the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee--of having been part of the Obama administration’s “pro-communist” policies in relation to Cuba's Castro regime. Trump said that if elected, Biden would leave Americans at the mercy of a “socialist mob” at home.

“Biden wants to defund the police, he wants to call the cops the enemy which he did the other day, leaving every citizen at the mercy of a socialist mob, or a mob far worse than socialism was ever meant to be,” he said.

It comes as numerous polls continue to show Trump down against Biden both nationally and in swing states, having suffered a sharp decline over his handling of the coronavirus crisis that originated in China and hit the U.S. in March -- shutting down the economy.

BIDEN SAYS SOME FUNDING SHOULD 'ABSOLUTELY' BE REDIRECTED FROM POLICE

Since then, he has seen numbers drop further amid the protests and riots that broke out in the wake of the death of George Floyd, a Black man who died May 25 while in the custody of Minneapolis police.

But in recent weeks Trump has taken a tough stance on the efforts by left-wing groups to tear down statues and defund police, tapping into a focus on law and order which he used in his 2016 campaign.

Biden has not backed the more radical demands of the left, although he has supported calls for police reforms and this week said that some funding should ""absolutely"" be directed away from the police. But the Trump campaign has claimed that a Biden administration would give in to the demands of radicals.

Earlier, Trump had taken a tough line on law enforcement after receiving a briefing from U.S. Southern Command on the fight against narcotic smuggling.

“I will not have open borders. We will not abolish the police. And we will not slash the budgets for our military,” he said.

Trump was due to attend a fundraising event later in the day before moving to New Hampshire for a political rally -- but the campaign announced that the event would be canceled due to an impending tropical storm.

Victor Garcia,"White House chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow told ""Bill Hemmer Reports"" Friday that schools have to reopen for in-person classes this fall because many parents can't work if their children have to learn at home.

""There's really no substitute for in-person schooling. I think all the experts agree with that. And also, look, the parents, what are they going to do?"" Kudlow told host Bill Hemmer. ""I mean, you talk to a single working mom, she's got to send her kid to school because if the kids at home, she can't go to work. She may not be able to afford help. It's also true with, you know, working folks who are ... two-person families. And I think that's an important part of this.

""There's an economic component but there's a kids component for education and social development,"" Kudlow added.

President Trump continued his push for schools across America to reopen by slamming “virtual learning” and claiming it has “proven to be terrible."" He also repeated his threat to withhold federal funding from school districts that keep students at home in the fall.

""If you want not only education, but if you want every business to reopen and stay open, if you want folks to go back to work and we have big job creation, if you want to rebuild the economic health and prosperity we had, there are four things every citizen should do, particularly those in the hot spots,"" Kudlow said.

Joshua Nelson,"A New York City store owner is suing Gov. Andrew Cuomo, accusing state and city leaders of failing to send in law enforcement to respond to the rioting that happened during recent protests, according to the attorney handling the case.

The lawsuit, filed on behalf of Domus Design Center, an interior design business located on Madison Avenue in Manhattan, also names Mayor Bill de Blasio and NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea as co-defendants.

“Basically, the city and state government owe a duty to the individual storefronts to protect them,"" attorney Sal Strazzullo said Friday on “Fox & Friends.”

""My law firm believes [that] through depositions, through discovery we’re going to be able to find that the city or state had intelligence in regards to these criminals that looted these stores and didn’t do anything about it,” he added.

Strazzullo continued, “The lackeys that are politically appointed in the NYPD probably were told to stand down and basically it is a travesty.""

He added that he believes more businesses will join as plaintiffs to make it a class-action lawsuit, seeking more than $100 million in damages.

The NYPD Lieutenants Benevolent Association on Tuesday slammed New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and other leaders for labeling the department “incompetent” and siding with “peaceful protesters,” despite a video showing a protester hitting a lieutenant on the back of his head with a brick amid riots and looting sparked by the death of George Floyd.

In a letter sent to NYPD lieutenants and obtained by Fox News, association president Lou Turco said politicians have been blaming law enforcement for “all the societal ills realistically created by their misdirected and hollow civic policies” while officers are being attacked.

The letter took direct aim to Cuomo, with Turco writing: ""How dare you call the members of the NYPD incompetent, when it is your misguided policies that have created an environment where police cannot police and you provide additional incentives to those who want to destroy society and commit crimes against people, law enforcement and property.""

The NYPD Police Benevolent Association (PBA) later released a video clip of the lieutenant getting hit, which it claimed preceded the officer drawing his gun on the crowd.

Tyler Mccarthy,"The late Charlie Daniels was honored by friends and fellow musicians during a touching memorial service in Tennessee on Friday.

The country music legend died on Monday at age 83 of a hemorrhagic stroke. The Grammy-winning and wildly acclaimed Country Music Hall of Fame and Grand Ole Opry member was known to be devoted to his faith, the U.S. military and lifting up other musicians, all of which were qualities that were mentioned by people who spoke at the World Outreach Church in Murfreesboro, Tenn. on Friday.

Among the celebrities to speak about the late music icon, known best for his monster 1979 hit “The Devil Went Down To Georgia,” were Travis Tritt, Vince Gill, Trace Adkins and Gretchen Wilson. In addition to the many people in attendance at the church, thousands watched the live stream of the memorial on social media.

CHARLIE DANIELS DESCRIBES THE EVENT THAT 'CHANGED MY WHOLE LIFE' IN FINAL INTERVIEW WITH FOX NATION

Among the first to eulogize Daniels was Navy SEAL and motivational speaker David Rutherford, who spoke about the singer’s immense love and support of the U.S. military.

“I’m centered in my faith and believe that Charlie’s words that he would always share with us,” he began. “If you’re good to each other, if you care for each other, if you serve each other above yourself, that’s what America is. And that man he was America.”

Rutherford then addressed the military members that were in the room or watching online on Daniels’ behalf.

“To all of you that are still putting the uniform on every day, I want to share with you what this man taught me. He said, ‘You don’t have to change the world through the barrel of a gun, although we sign up for that. You change the world with what’s in your heart. You change the world, one individual at a time, by sharing your love for each other and your love for this country. That’s how you change the world.' So gentlemen, don’t ever forget that,"" he said.

With that, Daniels’ good friend and fellow musician Adkins took the stage to share a lighthearted story about a time the late star was encouraging to him.

He explained that he once performed “The Devil Went Down To Georgia” with Daniels sitting in the front row at his induction in the Country Music Hall of Fame. He agreed to do it but realized just before he went on stage how nervous he was to sing the iconic song in front of its original singer. However, he did it.

“After I was done, Charlie looked at me and smiled and nodded his head and had a look on his face as if to say, ‘You’re welcome,’” Adkins said to laughs from the audience. “And I realized at that moment that he had given me an invaluable gift and it’s a gift I’d like to share today.”

Adkins said that whenever he has difficulty in his life, he simply thinks: “At least I’m not doing ‘Devil Went Down to Georgia’ with Charlie sitting in the front row… you can use that,” he said to more laughs and applause.

With that, he sang “Arlington,” one of Daniels’ favorite songs.

Daniels’ longtime roadie, Roger Campbell, took the stage to thank him for the years of work and friendship. He noted that Daniels was the only person in the business that would ever trust a tone-deaf man like him to be his guitar tuner.

Country music singer Vince Gill took the stage next to sing “Go Rest High On That Mountain” and the national anthem. He also commended Campbell on his service, kindness and friendship, noting those as qualities that stick out among all the people Daniels held dear. He also thanked Daniels for being the first to encourage him to perform solo after years of only ever being a member of a band.

Travis Tritt took the stage next to perform “Amazing Grace” after commending the late music legend for his faith.

“Charlie loved Jesus,” he said. “And he was never, to my knowledge, he was never judgemental or preachy about his beliefs. If you believed differently than he did, that was OK. But he wasn’t ashamed to tell you at any given time how much he loved the lord. And I always respected him so much for that. And I have no doubt, because I know how much Charlie loved God, I have no doubt that if there’s any person that I’ve ever met that heard the words ‘Well done, thou good and faithful servant,’ it was Charlie Daniels this past Monday.”

Gretchen Wilson closed out the memorial service’s performances by also commending Daniels on his faith.

“He’s been like a father to me,” she said. “He was there to hand me my diploma when I received my GED. He spoke at my graduation ceremony. He referred me to my financial advisers. He referred me to my medical team… And he referred me to Jesus on many occasions, and I thank him so much for that.”

With that, she sang “I’ll Fly Away.”

Caitlin Mcfall,"South Africa is seeing a surge of coronavirus cases, largely hitting the Gauteng province, home to the capital of Johannesburg, where hospitals are reaching capacity and medical oxygen is running out.

The country, located in the southern hemisphere and currently in the middle of winter, is now bracing for what Health Minister Zweli Mkhize has warned is a “storm,” urging South Africans to follow health guidelines.

Heated tents have been set up in parking lots outside hospitals to handle the overflow of patients.

“The patients are scared, very, very scared,” Lynne Wilkinson, a public health specialist said Friday.

Wilkinson is a part of a volunteer effort to locate 100 new oxygen concentrators for a 450-bed field hospital in Johannesburg.

Over the last week, Africa saw a 24 percent increase in coronavirus cases, and South Africa is among the countries hardest hit, according to John Nkengasong, head of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Egypt, Algeria, Ghana, Nigeria and South Africa account for 71 percent of the continent’s cases, though there are fears among health officials that the lack of testing and transparency in other nations could mean a far more severe situation in Africa, reported The Guardian.

South Africa reported a new daily-high of 13,674 cases Friday, bringing the nation’s total confirmed cases to 238,339, according to a report by the World Health Organization (WHO).

Over a third of the nation’s cases are in the Gauteng province.

CORONAVIRUS SPREADS TO TIMBUKTU, DESPITE ITS REMOTE LOCATION

“The storm that we have consistently warned South Africans about is now arriving,” Mkhize said.

Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital, the third largest hospital in the world, housing more than 3,000 beds, has been inundated with COVID-19 patients who are now being placed in non-designated coronavirus wards, as they are at capacity, according to The Associated Press.

“Our hospital is overloaded already. There has been an influx of patients over the last two weeks,” a nurse at the hospital told The AP.

She also said that her colleagues are testing positive daily, “even people who are not working in COVID wards.”

At least 8,000 health workers across Africa have tested positive for coronavirus, but half of them are from South Africa.

South Africa originally had strict coronavirus lockdown measures in place and had even banned the sale of alcohol.

But on June first, eager to reopen the struggling economy, authorities permitted table service at restaurants and religious services.

Caitlin Mcfall,"A top Russian diplomat said Friday that he is not optimistic that the U.S.-Russian nuclear arms agreement will be extended because of Washington’s demands to include China in the proposal.

Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov cautioned the Trump administration that Russia will continue to protect its security defenses, with or without the New START treaty, noting they are likely unwilling to accept Washington’s new demands.

The New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) was signed in 2010 by former President Barack Obama and then Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. The agreement, made in accordance with the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty, limited the number of deployed nuclear warheads to no more than 1,550 along with 700 missiles and bombers.

AMBASSADOR CRAFT HITS CHINA, RUSSIA FOR BACKING SYRIAN REGIME'S 'CAMPAIGN OF BRUTALITY'

Both the U.S. and Russia pulled out of the original 1987 nuclear arms agreement last year, leaving the New START treaty as the last line of defense against nuclear proliferation between the world’s leading nations in nuclear development.

If the treaty expired it would be the first time the U.S. and Russia were not united in a nuclear arms treaty since the Cold War.

“We only need the extension as much as the Americans do,” Lavrov said during a conference call with foreign policy experts Friday. “If they categorically refuse, we will not try to persuade them.”

Russia has said they would extend the treaty, which is set to expire Feb. 2021, without any additional provisions. But the Trump administration is now pushing for a new agreement that would include China.

Russia security officials are claiming this new agreement is unrealistic, and point to China’s repeated refusals to negotiate an arms deal that requires they reduce their number of nuclear arms.

The U.S. and Russia account for more than 90 percent of the world’s nuclear arms, according to Defense News.

China has said they are committed to a no first-use policy -- a nuclear deterance strategy that means China won’t strike first. However, China is working to increase its nuclear forces and has reportedly expanded its response capabilities, as reported by Defense News.

Lavrov rejected the U.S.’s calls to have Russia negotiate with China on reducing its nuclear arms arsenal, calling it “undiplomatic”. He said that they would be happy to discuss nuclear arms reductions with any country whether it’s Britain, France or China but said it needs to be that country’s decision.

“I’m not particularly optimistic about the New START in view of the course taken by U.S. negotiators,” Lavrov said.

Lavrov said that the administration’s new stance on nuclear arms is making it more unlikely an agreement can be reached, adding “we are absolutely confident that we can guarantee our security for a long perspective, even in the absence of this treaty.”

The U.S’s new contingency comes amid increasingly strained tensions between the U.S. and China – Lavrov note that the feud could hurt the global economy.

But when asked if Russia could assist in brokering their relationship Lavrov said “If they ask us, if they show such interest, we won’t refuse to do so.”

“We’ve established contact with both parties,” Lavrov said. “We are always ready to try to help, but, of course, we won’t push our services on anyone.”

Russia is now debating pulling out of the Open Skies Treaty, which allows for observation flights over military facilities, after Trump announced in May the U.S. may be pulling out of the 2002 agreement.

“We will make a final decision on whether to stay in it after we weigh all the consequences of the U.S. withdrawal,” Lavrov said.

The European Union has urged the U.S. to reconsider.

The Department of State could not be reached to answer whether or not the U.S. would allow the nuclear arms treaty with Russia to expire if China refuses to sign the new agreement.

Adriana Cohen,"One of the greatest threats to America today is that everything has become politicized -- and our nation is worse off for it.

Pastimes that used to bring our country together for some apolitical fun, such as football and other sports, have now been hijacked by social justice warriors who exploit any opportunity to advance their political agenda -- no matter the cost. But where America needs to draw a big fat line in the sand is education. We simply can't allow our nation's schools to remain closed indefinitely for political reasons, not scientific ones.

Going to school is an essential function of a civilized society. Yet, many on the left and in the almighty teachers unions are actively lobbying to keep schools closed, or partially closed, this fall at society's collective expense. They claim it's too high risk to hold in-person classes during a pandemic. However, these are the same folks who stayed curiously silent the past six weeks while as many as 15 million to 26 million Black Lives Matter protestors, according to a New York Times estimation, stood shoulder-to-shoulder violating social distancing rules.

TRUMP SAYS 'VIRTUAL LEARNING HAD PROVEN TO BE TERRIBLE,' THREATENS CUTS TO FEDERAL FUNDS

In fact, Democratic governors and mayors who imposed draconian lockdowns that banned law-abiding taxpayers from going to church, work or even attending a love one's funeral -- or risk fines or imprisonment -- marched alongside protestors at the massive gatherings without a care in the world about catching or spreading the virus. Obviously, if these hypocrites were truly fearful of contracting the coronavirus, or spreading it to others, they wouldn't have taken the risk and stayed home.

Evidently, it was more important to them to virtue signal and pander for votes at the nationwide protests than it was to curtail the spread of the coronavirus, which just last March, they insisted was so serious that the pandemic warranted a national quarantine -- derailing the economy and stripping our collective rights enshrined in the U.S. Constitution.

Now, these same government and teachers unions officials who support the protests are trying to keep classrooms closed, or partially closed, in favor of subpar online learning. What changed? Where's the scientific evidence that says the coronavirus only spreads on school buses and in classrooms but not at massive political gatherings?

What the scientific data does demonstrate -- which the biased media fails to highlight -- is that kids are much less likely to get coronavirus or die from it than the seasonal flu. Yet, we don't radically alter the U.S. education system or close schools because of it. The American Academy of Pediatrics has issued a report strongly advocating students be physically present in classrooms this fall stating:

""The importance of in-person learning is well-documented, and there is already evidence of the negative impacts on children because of school closures in the spring of 2020.

""Lengthy time away from school and associated interruption of supportive services often results in social isolation, making it difficult for schools to identify and address important learning deficits, as well as child and adolescent physical or sexual abuse, substance use, depression, and suicidal ideation.

""This, in turn, places children and adolescents at considerable risk of morbidity and, in some cases, mortality.""

Other countries reopened schools months ago, indicating this can be done safely and successfully. Denmark, Austria and Germany reopened their schools in April and May without fanfare. ""In fact, the statistical models predicted there would be more spreading than was actually observed, according to Soren Riis Paludan, professor in virology at Aarhus University,"" reported Politico. ""Opening the schools has really not been translated into any imprint in the transmission numbers,"" he said.

That said, our kids are entitled to a proper education, going to school five days a week and being taught by teachers in the classroom. That's what our taxes pay for, not inferior self-isolated online learning that can harm kids physically, mentally and emotionally.

Come September, any teacher who is high risk for getting the coronavirus should stay home and do online teaching while the rest of the healthy population returns to the classroom. Schools should institute commonsense protocols such as increased sanitation and mandated frequent hand-washing.

Bottom line: We shouldn't be banning kids from going to school. Instead, we should be banning false narratives that say marching in political protests is ""safe"" or worth the risk but kids sitting in a classroom getting a proper education is not.

In an interview on ""Fox & Friends,"" Jones pointed out that the former vice president has been swayed farther and farther to the left as his party shifts towards the positions of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

TRUMP CLAIMS FAR LEFT 'BRAINWASHED' BIDEN IN 'HANNITY' EXCLUSIVE: 'HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HE IS DOING'

On Thursday, Biden unveiled his ""Build Back Better"" economic plan, which centered on manufacturing, innovation, and middle-class families--hallmarks of President Trump's ""America First"" platform.

""The truth is throughout this [coronavirus] crisis, Donald Trump has been almost singularly focused on the stock market — the Dow and Nasdaq — not you, not your families,"" Biden said. ""If I'm fortunate enough to be elected president, I'll be laser-focused on working families, the middle-class families that I came from.""

""Friends"" host Steve Doocy noted: ""You know, the Joe Biden camp says regarding his...plan that it's actually quite moderate because it does not cave completely to the radical left; because they didn't put the Green New Deal in it, they didn't put [in] Medicare-for-all, they didn't get rid of fracking in the United States. So, is it ultimately moderate or is it a tilt to the left?""

""No, it’s progressive,"" Lawrence replied.

""And, as I continue to tell people, Bernie Sanders is the most popular Democrat. He is the most powerful Democrat even though he is not really a Democrat. He wants incremental change. He wants generational change. He is not worried about being president,"" Jones said. ""And, as you can see Joe Biden is adopting policies that [are] associated with him.""

But the thing that worries Jones the most is that Biden's promises to the American electorate often seem contradictory.

""But, the thing that is concerning is that you have him releasing this proposal that is supposed to be this compromise to get those progressive voters because he needs them or they are not going to show up if he doesn't adopt something. And then, you have a speech of him talking about America first and putting American jobs first. And, it seems like a contradiction,"" he said. ""And so, this is why we need debates.

Julia Musto,"The mainstream media ""crossed the Rubicon"" with flagrant lies about President Trump's Mount Rushmore Independence Day address, Wall Street Journal (WSJ) columnist Holman W. Jenkins Jr. wrote Tuesday.

In his op-ed, Jenkins argued that liberal members of the press distorted the president's July 3 speech, inserting their own narrative about an ""unyielding push to preserve Confederate symbols and the legacy of White domination.""

CRITICS PAN MAINSTREAM MEDIA FOR BRANDING TRUMP'S MOUNT RUSHMORE SPEECH AS 'DARK AND DIVISIVE'

However, The New York Times – although labeling the address ""dark and divisive"" – broke with the herd, noting Trump made no reference to the Confederacy and that his only reference to the Civil War was regarding President Abraham Lincoln and the abolition of slavery.

Jenkins also pointed out that as the president ""unleashed his uninformed Twitter rant about NASCAR's misconstrued noose incident"" and its ban on Confederate symbols just a day later, the Times again highlighted that Trump ""avoided specifically mentioning anything related to Confederate monuments.”

""Which I’m guessing means that Trump-defending pundits aren’t the only ones troubled by the Rubicon we’ve crossed when mainstream press outlets and a U.S. senator flagrantly lie about the content of a presidential address,"" he mused.

Meantime, WSJ Editorial Page deputy director Daniel Henninger wrote Wednesday that the president's Fourth of July speech was ""a detailed, articulate defense of American history and values"" the ""evening news"" ignored in favor of ""downer-ism"" following ""unprecedented events.""

""You saw a catalog of weekend violence, killings and more protests. Not least was the toppling in Rochester, N.Y., of a statue of Frederick Douglass, a founding father of Black American pride,"" he said.

""These are times – and emotions – that don’t lend themselves to conventional political analysis,"" Henninger asserted.

""With the election near, the Trump-wallowing media has decided its commitment to 'truth' requires distortions of reality, such as that his Mount Rushmore speech was 'dark,' the protesters are voices of light (really), and the reviving economy is actually sinking,"" he wrote. ""But much of the media is propagating this doom-to-the-horizon scenario – the threat of death or limitless systemic racism – when the public is focused on finding an upside and an exit from what they’ve just been through.""

In a Thursday interview on ""America's Newsroom,"" Henninger expanded on his commentary, explaining that ""conventional metrics and analysis"" have flown out the window in 2020.

While ""coalitions"" are ""shifting"" in the aftermath of nationwide protests against the death of George Floyd and amid the coronavirus pandemic, Henninger said the president was ""onto something with that Mount Rushmore speech.""

""No matter what your politics, who wants more people out of work?"" she went on. ""Almost every CEO, boss, & person I interact with and consume products from disagrees with me.""

The backlash began after Goya CEO Bob Unanue said Thursday that ""we're all truly blessed at the same time to have a leader like President Trump, who is a builder.""

""Support the workers by empowering them to be stronger than this absolute bastard,"" she said, referring to Unanue. ""I will personally do what I can to financially ensure these farms can carry on without them.""

Teigen also pushed back on the idea that a boycott would harm Goya workers.

Stephanie Bennett,"MARANA, Ariz. —As the coronavirus pandemic continues to impact businesses, some industries are actually benefitting from the chaos.

Pasta sales are soaring and, it turns out, Italy buys some of its most important ingredients right here in the U.S.

“Where does Italy get some of its best wheat and they never guess Arizona,” Eric Wilkey, president of Arizona Grain, Inc. told Fox News.

FARMERS DUBBED THE 'CARBON COWBOYS' SAY BUSINESS IS BOOMING DURING CORONAVIRUS

Farmers say the Grand Canyon state has the ideal conditions for growing Desert Durum wheat, a popular ingredient for making pasta. It brings in between $60 to $80 million annually to the state.

“The Italians have really favored the quality of this wheat for over 30 years,” said Wilkey. “Here it’s going to be sunny every day, we can turn irrigation on and off and so that’s our kind of unique environment, it creates a consistently high quality product...we have very low disease incidents, diseases that would find their way into wheat crops.”

Arizona Grain, Inc. helps process around 330 million pounds of Desert Durum each year, shipping to factories around the world, who then turn the grain into pasta. Wilkey says their durum can make roughly 300 million boxes of pasta. They export half of that to Italy, and COVID-19 has sent orders soaring.

“What we have seen is our customers who have already purchased come back and say 'I would like to buy some more, can I add to that contract,'” said Wilkey.

THE DESPERATE STRUGGLE TO STOP THE MASS SLAUGHTER AND WASTE OF FARM ANIMALS AS CORONAVIRUS CRISIS GRINDS ON

Known for its extended shelf life, pasta is a staple of panic buying. Thanks to the coronavirus pandemic, the National Pasta Association estimates sales increased by 18 percent across the U.S.

“Indeed we’ve seen a renaissance in the last several months of pasta consumption as people have rediscovered the ultimate comfort food,” said Carl Zuanelli, National Pasta Association chairman and CEO of Nuovo Pasta. ""Leading up to pre-Covid data the consumption had been flat going into February.”

Arizona Grain, Inc. created a program called Identity Preserve in which wheat breeders, producers, and the handlers take the best seed genetics to recreate more seeds for future use.

""The grower grows it, we keep it isolated and that delivers the best characteristics to a pasta manufacturer because he knows he’s going to get the same thing every time, every year he buys it from us,"" said Wilkey.

Arizona farmers hope this buying trend continues. Jon Post, of Post Farms in Marana, Ariz., has been growing Desert Durum for 25 years, and wrapped up his harvesting last week.

“I mean we’re all hoping that the recent spike in pasta usage will translate into higher prices for our durum next year,” said Post.

Desert Durum wheat isn’t as profitable as veggies, but if demand stays strong, and prices rise, it could be good for farmers.

“I hope that they’ve eaten so much pasta that they need all the durum wheat we can produce next year,” said Post.

Some New York City restauranteurs reportedly have another problem on their plates after recently reopening for outdoor dining amid the coronavirus health crisis: rats.

As part of Phase 2 of the city’s reopening plan, food-serving establishments in the Big Apple got the green light to welcome customers with sidewalk and patio seating starting on June 22. However, some business owners have complained that all the al fresco dining is drawing rodents.

""Last night, a customer had a baby rat running on his shoe and I let you just imagine his reaction,” Giacomo Romano, the owner of Italian restaurant Ciccio in SoHo, told NBC New York in a Friday interview.

Ciccio is close to Father Fagan Park, which Romano alleges has only one trash can. Now, the restauranteur is asking city officials to step up sanitation efforts during the busy summer season.

Another nearby business owner echoed similar sentiments — though he’s not even in the restaurant business.

Pasquale Giacobbe recently reopened his barbershop on the same street and is “already fed up with the rodents,” per NBC.

Andy Puzder,"The early economic signs indicate that we may already be in a “V”-shaped recovery — or at the very least a strong checkmark-shaped recovery — as we cautiously emerge from the coronavirus shutdown.

As Federal Reserve Bank Chairman Jay Powell admitted earlier this week, we have experienced a welcome “bounce back in economic activity,” and “have done so sooner than expected.” The economic data from the past two months make the point.

The May jobs report gave us the first indication that the post-pandemic rebound would be something special, revealing that employers had created a record-shattering 2.5 million jobs in a single month, beating economists' expectations for a loss of around 9 million jobs.

SEN. RICK SCOTT: CORONAVIRUS MANDATES – AMERICANS WILL MAKE THE RIGHT DECISIONS IF GIVEN MORE INFORMATION

Most economists anticipated that the trend would continue, but few foresaw just how stellar the June jobs report turned out to be. Last month, the country gained a mind-boggling 4.8 million new jobs, blowing past consensus expectations of around 3.7 million. As an added bonus, last month’s total was revised upward by nearly 200,000 jobs, bring the two-month gain to 7.5 million jobs.

Even though the labor force participation rate rose sharply, meaning more people began looking for work, the nationwide unemployment rate nonetheless plummeted in June by more than two full percentage points, falling from 13.3 percent to 11.1 percent, also beating economists’ expectations of a 0.8 of a percentage point decrease to 12.5 percent.

Those are some incredible numbers! But what else were we seeing in the economy?

In May, retail sales increased by a record 17.7 percent, soundly beating economists’ expectations of around 8.4 percent. This increase in retail sales — following three months of declines — bodes well for a return to positive economic growth. Consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of our economic output, and retail sales account for about a quarter of consumer spending.

New home sales, a leading indicator of housing market health, were up 16.6 percent in May, beating economists’ expectations of a 1.9 percent increase — with many economists having forecasted negative sales in May.

The renaissance is taking place across the board as state and local officials roll back their lockdown orders.

The National Association of Realtors recently reported that its index of pending home sales, a forward-looking indicator based on contract signings, rebounded by a record-setting 44.3 percent in May, driving the index to 99.6, the highest month-over-month gain since its inception in January 2001.

So how about June? It’s obviously early, but we have some data in addition to the jobs numbers.

Manufacturing, which represents about 11 percent of the U.S. economy, saw a big positive jump in June for the second straight month. The Institute for Supply Manufacturing survey showed that 52.6 percent of companies said their businesses are growing, up from 43.1 percent in May. That’s the best score since April of 2019 — and, of course, it beat economists’ expectations of 49.5 percent.

Consumers saw the writing on the wall in June even if the economists missed it — again. The Conference Board, a New York-based research organization, said that its Consumer Confidence Index rose to 98.1 in June from 85.9 in May, the biggest jump since 2011 and beating economists’ expectations of 90.5.

Not wanting to miss out on all the positivity, the stock markets — which are forward-looking — closed up nearly 20 percent for the quarter ending June 30, their best quarterly percentage increase since 1998.

Bottom line: the economic improvements over the past two months have been tremendous.

The renaissance is taking place across the board as state and local officials roll back their lockdown orders, though the gains are naturally being led by industries that were hit hardest by the pandemic, including leisure and hospitality (2.1 million new jobs), retail (740,000 new jobs), education and health services (568,000 new jobs), and manufacturing (356,000 new jobs).

There are plenty of lockdown orders still in place all over the country, meaning we’ve got ample potential for additional growth just by continuing to responsibly return to normal, even if we occasionally need to douse the embers of the pandemic here and there.

This unprecedented “V”-shaped recovery is exactly what President Trump predicted at the height of the COVID-19 downturn.

Talia Kaplan,"The CEO of an Arizona fitness club company told “Fox & Friends Weekend” on Sunday that he feels “singled out” and is suing Gov. Doug Ducey over what he calls an “arbitrary” decision to re-close gyms as coronavirus cases surge.

“The decision was just arbitrary, there was no fact behind the decision,” Mountainside Fitness CEO Tom Hatten said the day before he was scheduled to appear in court.

He added that he received no warning and the decision to close gyms wasn’t consistent with “the previous mandate for everybody to close down.”

“We just felt like it was unconstitutional when you can make arbitrary decisions like that,” he continued, adding that there were “statutes in our Arizona law that [don’t] allow for that and that’s where our basis of our case is as we look tomorrow for a stay.”

Mountainside’s nearly 20 locations were closed for two months following the Republican governor’s mandate. The company reported it received no governmental assistance.

Last week, Ducey ordered the closure of bars, gyms, movie theaters, nightclubs and water parks across the state for 30 days in an effort to combat the spike in coronavirus cases.

Most bars and nightclubs reopened after Ducey let stay-at-home and business closures expire in May. Bars that didn’t serve food were allowed to reopen, a loophole that led to packed venues and almost no way to practice social distancing, The Associated Press reported.

When asked what he was doing to keep gym-goers safe, Hatten said, “Everything that we can possibly do.”

“Before we had opened up, we had worked closely with the governor’s office to write the protocols that we put in place for when we did open,” he continued, adding that “that’s part of the frustration.”

He explained, “We were following the protocols perfectly, from all the cleaning that we’ve been doing, to social distancing, to taking temperatures of the employees, washing hands every 30 minutes. I can go on and on.”

Hatten added, “We were fully in compliance with everything that we had been working with them to do to open.”

When asked what he would say to critics arguing that more businesses should be shutting down rather than opening up Hatten said, “I definitely agree.”

“This isn’t about the science of COVID,” he continued. “We all understand, here in Arizona, the problem with the number of positive cases growing. This is about the arbitrary nature of the decision of our governor.”

He went on, “It really starts to look into, if it’s our business, what’s the reason, what’s the facts behind this particular business, why not the other 99 percent of businesses that are open? Why are those left open and why are we singled out and closed?”

Hatten continued, “We feel strongly, if the numbers are true, then let’s step back and take a unilateral approach to everything here in Arizona, not just fitness centers.”

Ducey did not immediately respond to Fox News’ request for comment.

Business and union leaders say the city needs to mount a kind of Marshall Plan-like effort to find child care for many of the system’s 1.1 million students when they are not in classrooms. They said there was no way the economy — from conglomerates in Midtown Manhattan to small businesses in Queens — could fully return to normal if parents had no choice but to stay at home to watch their children.

The concerns reflected a growing recognition across the nation that the reopening of schools could be the linchpin in the broader effort to undo the severe economic damage from the outbreak. New York City alone is facing its worst financial crisis since the 1970s, with an unemployment rate hovering near 20 percent.

“There is no discussion of this right now that’s serious,” said Kathryn S. Wylde, chief executive of the Partnership for New York City, whose members include the city’s biggest private-sector employers. “There is not a serious solution. Which means that people will not be able to go back to work.”",Big New Obstacle for Economic Recovery: Child Care Crisis,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/10/nyregion/nyc-school-daycare-reopening.html,2020-07-10
The Editorial Board,"Crucially, money alone is not enough. If safety dictates that classrooms can hold only half as many students, it follows that schools need twice as much room. Some of that space can be found by repurposing gyms and cafeterias, but districts including New York have cited a lack of space as a key reason students won’t be able to return full time.

Officials need to think outside the building. Some fall classes could be held in the open air, or under tents with no walls — spaces in which the available evidence suggests transmission risks also are much lower. In Denmark, schools held spring classes on playgrounds, in public parks and even in the stands of the national soccer stadium.

Some states, including Florida, Minnesota and Connecticut, have encouraged schools to use available outdoor space. Particularly in cities, where space is scarce, officials should give serious consideration to closing streets around schools and holding classes there.

Under the circumstances, public education is surely the best use of those public spaces.

Outdoor education is not a cure-all. Students still would need to use shared bathrooms. Equipment still would need to be stored in buildings. Environmental conditions also are a limiting factor: heat, rain, high winds — and air pollution.

But American communities need to choose among the available options.

The limits of virtual classrooms were on painful display this spring. While some students thrived, or at least continued to learn, others faded away. Boston reported that roughly 20 percent of enrolled students never logged in. In Los Angeles, one-third of high school students failed to participate. In Washington, D.C., the school system simply gave up and ended the school year three weeks early. Evidence suggests schools particularly struggled to reach lower-income kids, exacerbating performance gaps.

The closures also have also deprived students of time with friends, limited their access to reliable meals, physical and mental health care and reduced the availability of support for those with special needs. Students have been thrown back on the resources of their families, and in every dimension, those with the fewest resources have tended to suffer most — a pattern certain to continue in the fall.

The economic damage is real, too. The consulting firm McKinsey estimates that 27 million American workers require child care, which includes schools, to return to full-time work.",Opinion | Reopening Schools Will Be a Huge Undertaking.

Jamelle Bouie,"We should keep all of this in mind as we try to understand the Trump administration’s response to the Covid-19 economic crisis, whether it is the hostility to more stimulus, the indifference to the mounting eviction crisis, the opposition to state budget aid, the drive to reopen businesses, or the current push to reopen public schools, even as the virus rages nearly out of control in huge sections of the country.

Yes, you can understand the president’s approach as an attempt to goose the economy enough for him to win a second term (Democrats “don’t want to reopen because they think it will help them on Nov. 3,” Trump said on Thursday). But there’s a reason his business allies are committed to the same course of action. A forced reopening helps keep the market afloat; it is what you would do if you were trying to protect capital from any serious losses. And it is exactly what you would expect from an administration whose central aim, beyond immigration restrictionism, is the upward redistribution of wealth to heirs, owners and industry.

Let’s turn back to schools. Trump, again, wants them open. “In Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden and many other countries, SCHOOLS ARE OPEN WITH NO PROBLEMS,” the president said on Twitter on Wednesday. “The Dems think it would be bad for them politically if U.S. schools open before the November Election, but is important for the children & families.” He also threatened to “cut off funding if not open.” His education secretary, Betsy DeVos, said the same. “Kids have to continue learning and schools have to open up,” she told Fox News, announcing, like Trump, that she is “very seriously” considering withholding federal funding.

But it was Trump’s secretary of labor, Eugene Scalia, who made clear why the administration is so eager to open schools, even as the pandemic rages out of control. “One study has suggested that if we closed all our schools and day care for just a month — just, hypothetically, if we did that — the impact on U.S. productivity would be in the order of $50 billion,” he said at a Wednesday press briefing for the White House Coronavirus Task Force.

Many parents, for good reason, want to send their children back to school. Others aren’t so sure. The situation is dire. But that has everything to do with the priorities of an administration that shows no real interest in fighting the virus and has done everything it can to prevent additional lockdowns.",Opinion | Trump Would Like to See You Now,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/10/opinion/trump-schools-reopening.html,2020-07-10
David Leonhardt,"True, predictions of forthcoming Republican moderation haven’t fared well in recent years. Yet even if they again prove wrong, Democrats may pursue an ambitious agenda by abandoning the Senate filibuster, as many progressives favor, and passing legislation on a majority basis.

That agenda is shaping up to have two defining features. The first is reducing inequality — through higher taxes on the rich, greater scrutiny of big companies, new efforts to reduce racial injustice and more investments and programs for the middle class and poor, including health care, education and paid leave. The second is acting on climate change, which could cause even more global misery than the coronavirus. “Climate change cannot be solved by the private sector,” Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democrats’ minority leader, told me. “People under 45 realize it.”

Mr. Biden may not seem like a history-altering figure, certainly like less of one than Barack Obama did. But he could wind up presiding over a larger scale of political change than Mr. Obama did, for reasons largely independent of the two men themselves.

Ms. Boushey, who runs the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, argues that progressives are better positioned to pass sweeping change in 2021 than they were in 2009, after the financial crisis. Then, the only major policy area in which Democrats had a comprehensive, politically viable plan was health care — and, not coincidentally, it became Mr. Obama’s biggest policy success.

“Although you had this crisis, you didn’t have the ideas that were ready to go,” Ms. Boushey said. Today, by contrast, progressives have spent years working through the details of plans on climate change, high-end tax increases, antitrust policy and more. And while Mr. Obama’s team had only a couple of months to plan for taking office amid a national crisis, Mr. Biden’s team would have almost a year. “There is a whole vision that I think is ready,” Ms. Boushey added. “And there is a lot more runway.”

Mr. Biden and congressional Democrats would need to avoid getting bogged down in intramural squabbles between the center and the left. But the potential exists for the farthest-reaching period of legislative change since Ronald Reagan’s presidency.

In less than 15 years, the United States has suffered the biggest two economic crises since the Great Depression, the worst pandemic in more than a century and the election of two presidents unlike any before them — and diametrically unlike each other. If there is a single lesson of the current era of American politics, it’s that change can happen more quickly than we imagined.

Adam Easton,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Andrzej Duda (L) is facing Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski

Poland's presidential election on Sunday will be crucial in shaping the country's future and its strained relations with the EU for at least the next three years and perhaps beyond.

Why run-off presents Poles with clear choice

If the incumbent President Andrzej Duda is re-elected for another five-year term, his allies, the nationalist Law and Justice-led government will continue their socially conservative policies, efforts to control independent institutions and generous state handout programme.

If the more liberal mayor of Warsaw, Rafal Trzaskowski, wins, he has said he will stand up for minorities and use the president's right to veto legislation to block what he sees as the government's attempts to politicise the judiciary and attack democratic values.

Mr Trzaskowski says he will co-operate with the government but a victory for him would almost certainly start a war between the two branches of power.

Both men have distinct visions for the future of Poland.

What does Andrzej Duda believe?

President Duda, 48, is a lawyer by training. He won a surprising victory in 2015 representing the young, moderate face of the Law and Justice party, which had lost a string of elections under all powerful party leader and candidate, Jaroslaw Kaczynski.

He is a socially conservative Roman Catholic, who says he wants to defend the traditional family model.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The socially conservative Mr Duda has a lot of support in small towns and villages

On the one hand, he supports the government's popular and generous welfare scheme, symbolised by the 500+ programme, under which families receive 500 zloty (£100; €110; $125) per month for each child until the age of 18.

Many Polish families have been lifted out of poverty as a result of the government's policies, and, for the first time since the end of communism in 1989, feel there is a party that cares about their needs.

This is especially true in villages and small towns, where President Duda won an absolute majority of votes in the first round of the election two weeks ago.

On the other hand, he has vowed to protect Polish families from what he calls an imported ""LGBT ideology"" that is aggressively trying to sexualise Polish children.

In practice, sex education classes in Polish state schools do not exist.

Instead students have more wide-ranging ""family life education"" classes, which may include sex education, often led by priests or nuns.

President Duda is also a supporter of the government's legislative changes to take greater control over independent institutions, most prominently the public media and judiciary.

Poland's public broadcaster, Polish TV, is funded by the taxpayer and is bound by its charter to present balanced coverage of political events.

Instead, its main evening news bulletin praises the government and Mr Duda daily and attacks Mr Trzaskowski, accusing him of being in cahoots with Jewish and LGBT interest groups.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Mr Duda supports greater government control over the media

Mr Duda has also strongly backed most of the government's changes to the judiciary that the EU and multiple international organisations say have undermined its independence and the rule of law.

Relations with the EU have been strained as a result and Mr Duda once called it an ""imaginary community from which we don't gain much"".

Under the current budget, Poland is the biggest net recipient of EU funds.

What about Rafal Trzaskowski?

Mr Trzaskowski, also 48, is a deputy leader of Poland's centre-right Civic Platform party, which governed Poland between 2007-2015, mostly under Donald Tusk before he was elected to head the European Council.

His party has always performed best in large metropolitan cities.

Image copyright EPA Image caption Mr Trzaskowski is pro-EU and has support in Poland's major cities

In the first round, he won 30.46% of the vote to Mr Duda's 43.5%, scoring his biggest victory in the affluent Warsaw district of Wilanow.

In an interview with the BBC, Mr Trzaskowski acknowledged that some members of the government he was a minister in had at times been a ""bit patronising"" towards voters.

Although he's economically liberal, he said Law and Justice had correctly identified income inequality as a problem that needed to be addressed with programmes like 500+, a policy he says he supports.

He represents the more liberal wing of the party, and, as Warsaw mayor, has taken part in LGBTQ Equality marches and proposed introducing classes in the capital's schools to counteract bullying against minorities.

However, he said recently he opposed the adoption of children by same sex couples, which most Poles do according to surveys, after President Duda tabled an amendment to the country's constitution to expressly forbid it.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Polish democracy is 'under attack'

As president, Mr Trzaskowski's power would mostly be limited to vetoing legislation as any bills he presents himself could be rejected by the governing camp's majority in parliament.

He told the BBC that Poland was still democratic but its ""democracy is under attack"" as the government was politicising independent institutions, such as the judiciary, and trying to strip local government of its powers.

He said he would veto further attempts to politicise the courts and propose making the office of prosecutor general independent once again.

Under the current government the justice minister is also prosecutor general, giving him extraordinary power over the conduct of prosecutions.

As a former Europe minister, Mr Trzaskowski says he wants Poland to take a more active role in the EU negotiations.

He worries that once the financial benefit of membership is reduced in future, the current government's antipathy to some aspects of the European project could eventually lead to Poland leaving the EU.",Duda vs Trzaskowski: The fight for Poland's future,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-53339992,2020-07-10
Mike Maceacheran,"This story starts with an email that I will never forget.

On a late spring morning in mid-May, Prince Michael of Sealand, leader of a micronation called the Principality of Sealand, messaged me with five clear-cut words: “You can speak to me”.

It was a peculiarly short prologue to a barely believable story that would take me on a historical journey through the realms of self-proclaimed kings, territorial claims, historical anomalies and World War Britain. And, as unlikely as it sounds, pirate radio stations and cockle fishing, too.

Another fact about this exchange: it thrilled me. I’d never received an email from a prince before, and it was unlikely to ever happen again.

Of course, I’d come across the story of Sealand, a tiny principality off the English coast of Suffolk that claims to be the world’s smallest country, before. The micronation, in fact a solitary World War Two-era anti-aircraft platform, was first erected in 1942 as HM Fort Roughs, an armed sea fort outside of Britain's then territorial limit in the North Sea. From being occupied by up to 300 Royal Navy personnel at the height of the war to its final evacuation in 1956, the gun station was soon abandoned and left to fall into disrepair. That is, until 1966, when a former British Army major occupied it, giving birth to a new, tiny micronation.

I certainly didn’t think it’d be a story that’d carry on for 50-odd years

Today, it remains 12km offshore, visible up close only by boat. To look at, it is nothing special: a blasted-looking platform with a smattering of container-like buildings on top. To disembark requires braving whipping winds and moshing waves while being winched up by a crane.

But there was plenty more I didn’t know. Stories about dawn helicopter raids for one. Others about devious gangsters and an attempted coup by shady European businessmen. Even a revelation from a declassified UK government document describing the frontier as a “Cuba off the east coast of England”.

It all sounded like the plot to a B-movie, born from the pen of a Hollywood scriptwriter. Not from the determination of a working-class family from Essex who turned this outpost into a micronation. And yet here, in this lonely North Sea spot, dreams were born, freedom from authority was granted and British eccentricity — in all its pomp and pageant — ruled.

You may also be interested in:

• The tiny 'country' between England and Scotland

• Europe's strange border anomaly

• The 'nation' with a useless passport

Four days later, Prince Michael of Sealand answered my call. The micronation leader was armed with riveting tales, many of which appear in his memoir, Holding The Fort. And he was ready to divulge Sealand’s story, which largely remains unknown by the rest of the world.

“I was only 14 when I first came out during my school summer holidays to help my dad, and I thought it’d only be a six-week adventure,” he said, speaking from his main home, a bungalow on the Essex coast. “I certainly didn’t think it’d be a story that’d carry on for 50-odd years. It was a strange upbringing, as sometimes we stayed for months on end, waiting for the boat to bring supplies from the mainland. I’d look out at the horizon and all I could see from morning to night was the North Sea.”

Such nostalgia of a place shouldn’t dilute the complexities of Sealand’s contested geopolitical circumstances. No country formally recognises Sealand, even if Prince Michael says the micronation has never asked for recognition.

“We don’t expect any either,” he added, bluntly. “Remember, the platform was built illegally outside British territorial waters during a time of war – but everyone was too busy to care. The British should have destroyed it when they had the chance, but they never got ‘round to it. Now, decades later, Sealand is still here.”

By virtue of their size – just 0.004 sq km in Sealand’s case – micronations require us to reset our sense of scale. But what draws people to creating their own in the first place? For George Dunford, co-author of Micronations: The Lonely Planet Guide to Home-Made Nations, it’s a dissatisfaction with their current government and “wanting to do things their own way”.

“Sealand is a special case because it has got away with it for so long and ducked laws,” said Dunford. “In the United States, the family would have been seen as dissidents, but the UK was a more tolerant place back in the 1960s – and bureaucrats probably thought it more trouble than it was worth to tackle the problem. They had a few tries and there were takeover attempts, but it survived. It’s a real survivor of the micronations community.”

As a rule, most micronations trace their de facto recognition back to 1933 when the Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States was signed by international leaders, including then US President Franklin D Roosevelt. In it, the legislation sets out four main criteria for statehood.

“The Montevideo Convention is mostly commonly used to define a micronation, which calls for a population, territory, government and relations with other states,” Dunford explained. “It’s the last one that makes micronations most agitational because they often try to provoke other states into recognising them. Sealand eschews it by saying it’s a sovereign state with its own ruler.”

The British should have destroyed it when they had the chance, but they never got round to it

Every nation has a convoluted origin story and Sealand’s is more Kafkaesque than most. It begins in 1965 when Prince Michael’s father, Paddy Roy Bates, a former British Army major turned fisherman, began Radio Essex. This pirate radio station was located offshore on Knock John, another disused naval fort near HM Fort Roughs. Such was the popularity of the illegal offshore stations at the time, the UK government then rolled out the Marine Broadcasting Offences Act of 1967. It had one purpose: to shut them all down.

Seeing an opportunity, Bates moved his operation onto HM Fort Roughs — further out to sea and, and more importantly, further into contested international waters. Like Knock John, it was tenantless and in a state of disrepair – and, whether legal or not, Bates assumed control of the outpost on Christmas Eve 1966. Nine months later, on 2 September 1967, he declared it the Principality of Sealand – a romantic gesture on his wife Joan’s birthday. Shortly after, the entire family moved in.

At its peak, in the early 1970s, Sealand had 50 people living on the platform, including extended family and friends and maintenance personnel. At the same time, it became an unlikely symbol of anti-authority protests in the UK; but behind the scenes, the bohemian operation was run on a far more basic level.

“Nothing worked,” Prince Michael told me. “We started with candles then upgraded to hurricane lamps and pump-up generators. The good thing was it is as dry as a boat; if you didn’t know you were out at sea you could never tell. I spent years and years out there – but, you know, it was home.”

Ever since, the rogue state has embraced nationhood. It introduced its own coat of arms and constitution. There’s a flag, football team and anthem, while the currency bears the portrait of “Princess Joan” and around 500 passports have been issued. The motto of the micronation, over which Prince Michael and his three children (James, Liam and Charlotte) and second wife (Mei Shi, a former major in the Chinese People’s Liberation Army) continue the Sealand dynasty, reflects a love of unshackled independence. “E Mare, Libertas” it reads. Or, “From the sea, freedom”.

“My father never set out to start his own country,” explained Prince Michael, who is also owner of a cockle fishing business that exports seafood to Spain. “He was principally offended by the UK government wanting to close his pirate radio station. And ever since, we’ve fought the British government all the way – and won. Sealand still maintains its independence.”

By any measure, the most controversial episode in Sealand’s history took place in 1978. Buoyed by thoughts of an international takeover, a group of German and Dutch mercenaries stormed Sealand one August night, only to be captured at gunpoint by the Bates family and held hostage.

“It led to the German ambassador and an official delegation coming from the embassy in London by helicopter to hold negotiations for his release,” Prince Michael said nonchalantly, playing down the drama of the incident. “So, by negotiating, they in fact gave us de facto recognition.”

In the United States, the family would have been seen as dissidents

What’s not up for debate is that independence doesn’t come cheap. To fund Sealand’s operational costs – including two full-time security personnel who live on the micronation year-round – Sealand’s online store sells T-shirts, stamps and royal titles. A Lord, Lady, Baron or Baroness peerage costs £29.99.

The usual customs and immigration norms don’t apply either, of course. It’s only possible to visit with an official invitation from the prince, who visits two to three times a year, and beyond the shoestring staff, no-one currently lives here.

“Sealand has always teetered on being precarious, but the current prince runs the place on more of an even keel these days,” said Dunford. “That’s what I love about micronations. The way they parody the pomp of real nationalism is fabulous.” As a case in point, Sealand receives in excess of 100 emails a day, with requests from wannabe citizens from Delhi to Tokyo keen to pledge allegiance to the flag.

“Our story still fires people up,” Prince Michael concluded. “We don’t live in a society where people like being told what to do, and everybody loves the idea of liberty and freedom from government. The world needs inspiring territories like us – and there aren’t many places like this that exist.”

In Bates’ life, one thing has remained reassuringly constant: Sealand still stands tall, watching silently over the North Sea. For the rest of us, it is a curious place so near to the UK and yet so far – an elsewhere of this world so extraordinary and different that it almost feels impossible.

Lu-Hai Liang,"But in China, it’s a different picture. Deloitte’s 2018 China Mobile Consumer Survey showed that Chinese people checked their email 22% less than users globally. Instead WeChat is dominant; some 79.1% of smartphone owners are regular users of the app, while 84.5% of people who use messaging apps in China use WeChat. And that preference extends into the office: the 2017 WeChat user behaviour report compiled by Penguin Intelligence, a research arm of Tencent (which created WeChat), found that almost 88% of 20,000 people surveyed used WeChat in their daily work communication. Phones, SMS and fax were used by 59.5%. Email was a distant third on 22.6%.



Eva Hsu, who runs a digital branding business, is Taiwanese and spent some of her youth living in the US. She’s been working in Shanghai for six years. For her foreign clients, Hsu says she communicates via email and LinkedIn, but for her Chinese clients it’s a different story. “Chinese clients tend to use WeChat and send files on WeChat as the main way of communication,” she says.

Late adopters



With over a billion users in China, WeChat is a super app that is ubiquitous. But the reasons why Chinese people prefer communicating over a platform such as WeChat may have been formed years earlier. In 1999, newly-established Chinese technology company Tencent released a product called QQ, based on the popular desktop instant messaging programme ICQ, which was owned by AOL.



At the time, there were only 1.2 computers per 100 people in China, according to the World Bank. By contrast, there was one computer for every two people in the United States. But as the 2000s progressed internet cafes sprang up across China and were quickly embraced by young people. QQ became a key reason for the cafes’ popularity, as it provided entertainment with features such as games, music and an early Chinese social network where people could post micro-blogs. Compared to email, QQ offered more interaction, with the ability to create avatars, for example, and instant messaging.",Why email loses out to popular apps in China,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200707-why-email-loses-out-to-popular-apps-in-china,2020-07-07
Emily Mcauliffe,"Image copyright Alison George Image caption Mark Watkins makes award-winning rum in Australia

Rum distiller Mark Watkins is reflecting on his disastrous first attempt at making his own spirits when he was a teenager.

The then 16-year-old had set up a rudimentary distillery at the back of his parents' banana farm in the small town of Walkamin, in north-eastern Queensland, Australia.

His questionable safety standards nearly saw the family's crop go up in flames, and he almost poisoned his school friend.

""He's still alive, but he doesn't talk to me anymore,"" says Mr Watkins, now 39.

Nevertheless, this stumble out of the starting blocks left him unperturbed. He was on a mission to make top-quality spirits, with the ultimate goal of creating the best rum in the world. Two decades later, he's accomplished his mission.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Rum can be drunk neat, with a mixer, or as the base for numerous cocktails

Last year, the World Rum Awards named Mr Watkins' Iridium rum ""the world's best pot still rum, five years old and under"". It put his small business, Mt Uncle Distillery, on the global map.

Although the company is a tiny drop in the global spirits pool, Mt Uncle is one of a small but growing number of rum distilleries around the world taking the spirit in a new direction - low volume, premium production.

So, is rum now starting to follow the path set by gin over the past decade, which has seen a huge rise in the number of independent producers as demand has soared?

But first a reminder - what exactly is rum? It is a spirit made from distilling sugarcane juice, sugar cane syrup (concentrated juice), or sugarcane molasses, which is the thick, dark treacle you are left with after granulated sugar has been produced. It can be drunk neat, with water, a mixer or as a cocktail base.

A brief history of rum

Rum is synonymous with the Caribbean, where the first modern rums were distilled on sugarcane plantations in the 17th Century

The history of the spirit is intrinsically linked to slavery, as it was slaves working on the plantations who discovered that molasses, the dark treacle left over after sugar has been refined, could be fermented and then distilled into a spirit

Rum also became associated with the British Royal Navy, with sailors being given a daily ""rum ration"" from 1850 until the practice was ended in 1970. A type of dark rum called ""navy rum"" is still made and sold by a number of producers

Today the world's largest exporter of rum in value terms is the US ($159m in 2018), followed by Germany ($150m), Italy ($142m), Cuba and the Dominican Republic (both $105m) and Guatemala ($98m)

Assessed in its entirety, global rum production - which is dominated by mass market brands produced in huge volumes - has flat-lined in recent years.

Total worldwide sales by volume of standard or value-priced rum grew just 0.6% from 2014 to 2019, according to the latest figures from research group IWSR Drinks Market Analysis.

Yet at the same time, ""high-end rum"" bottles costing $28 (£22.50) or above grew by 8.3% over the same period, says the organisation.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Rum is made from sugarcane, here being harvested in Guadeloupe

""I think, in general, new generations of [rum drinkers] are drinking less, but they're drinking better,"" says Roberto Serralles, a sixth-generation rum-maker. His family own and run Puerto Rican business Destileria Serralles, which has been making rum since 1865.

""The rum category is heavily weighted at the lower end, so the higher premium end is growing, but with small volume, and that's why it gets lost.""

Many rum aficionados, like Mr Watkins, say that rum still has an inferior image, purveyed by cheap brands, and often, their subsequent hangovers.

""Lots of people got smashed on rum when they were 17, and haven't given it another chance,"" says the Australian. ""Lots of people are familiar with cheaper brands, and [for small distilleries] it can be a hard game to crack into, as there are so many big multinational companies involved.""

Image copyright Don Q Image caption Roberto Serralles's family has been making rum for 155 years

Rum consultant, and World Rum Awards chair of judges, Peter Holland agrees that the rum industry has some repositioning to do. ""A problem that we have in the rum world is that it's represented invariably by price, and that price is low,"" he says. ""When you race to the bottom you're not really driving up quality.""

Thus, Mr Holland's passion lies in re-educating the market about rum. He feels it is a spirit that has enormous potential, and a level of complexity - attained through different distillation and aging techniques - that is currently not well marketed or understood.

As Queensland is a big grower of sugar cane, Mt Uncle has a ready source of sugar syrup from which to make its rum. In fact, Mr Watkins' family farm in Walkamin, which is home to Mt Uncle Distillery, is right next to a sugar mill.

For rum producers in cooler countries where sugarcane cannot be grown, they typically rely on easily transportable and readily available molasses. This is the case at the UK's Two Drifters Rum.

Located outside the city of Exeter in the south west of England, the company is run by husband and wife team Russ and Gemma Wakeham.

They started out making beer in 2019, with a small distillery on the side ""for a bit of fun"" but have now switched to solely making rum.

""It was completely driven by the fact that we couldn't make enough of it,"" says Russ.

The company buys its molasses from UK sugar producers including Tate & Lyle. It now produces a range of rums, with the spiced version being the bestseller - though Mr Wakeham admits that purists would not see spiced rum as a true representation of the spirit.

Mr Holland says that if rum wants to cement its move upmarket, the industry should stop categorising the drink by its colour.

""Colour is not a flavour,"" he says. ""I think white, gold and dark are very disingenuous terms to categorise a very diverse market.

""You don't order gold whisky or dark cognac, so why should rum be tarred with that brush? If we can make the language around rum a bit more grown up, then I think we have a better chance of bringing people over [to the rum market].""

Mr Serralles says the industry also needs to better educate drinkers. ""Most people don't know what to do with rum.

""They've usually always thought of it as something you drink with Coke, or with an umbrella on vacation.""

With global rum sales totalling $16.5bn in 2019, according to the IWSR, it trails far behind vodka ($43.6bn) and whiskies ($74bn), but is still ahead of gin ($10.8bn).

So is rum really about to mirror gin's huge growth in sales, and see a significant rise in the number of small producers as it surges in popularity?

""That's the question on everyone's lips,"" says Mr Watkins. ""I think rum could be the next boom spirit. It's definitely due for it.""",Is rum about to become the new gin?,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-53320176,2020-07-10
Jonathan Josephs,"Image caption Emirates president Sir Tim Clark

The president of Emirates said the Middle Eastern airline is set to cut as many as 9,000 jobs because of the coronavirus pandemic.

It is the first time the world's biggest long-haul carrier has disclosed how many jobs will be lost.

Prior to the crisis, Emirates had 60,000 staff.

Sir Tim Clark said the airline had already cut a tenth of its staff but said: ""We will probably have to let go of a few more, probably up to 15%.""

The global airline industry has been severely impacted by coronavirus, with activity all but grinding to a halt.

In an interview with the BBC, Sir Tim said Emirates was ""not as badly off as others"".

But its current situation marks a steep turnaround in the fortunes of the airline, which he said before the pandemic was ""heading for one of our best years ever"".

The job cuts sweeping the wider aviation industry are fuelling concern amongst Emirates staff that things might get worse.

The BBC understands there is growing frustration at what they see as poor communications and transparency from the airline.

At least 700 of the airline's 4,500 pilots were given redundancy notices this week, which means at least 1,200 have been told their jobs are going since the coronavirus crisis started.

Image copyright Reuters

The cuts have been focussed on those who fly Airbus planes, rather than Boeing aircraft.

Emirates flies superjumbo Airbus A380s which hold around 500 passengers. Whereas the Boeing 777s it flies hold fewer passengers and are therefore easier to fill during this period of decreased airline travel.

00Thousands of cabin crew have also been told they are no longer needed.

Further cuts

The International Air Transport Association, which represents 290 airlines, is forecasting that the world's airlines will lose more than $84bn and one million jobs this year.

This week United Airlines, one of the big three in the US, warned its staff that it may have to cut 36,000 staff because of the huge fall in demand for air travel.

Helane Becker, managing director and senior research analyst at investment firm Cowen said given ""the continuing issues surrounding the pandemic"" she expects US airlines to cull up to 200,000 of their 750,000 staff this year.

US aviation unions are pushing the federal government to add to the $25bn bailout package it has provided so far.

As part of the conditions for receiving state help, airlines have to protect jobs until the end of September.

But IATA says there are wider benefits in doing so.

A spokesman said the scale of job cuts in the aviation sector ""shows the severe economic crisis facing the industry and all who depend on air connectivity"".

Adding that its perfectly understandable that governments have put restrictions in place to try and keep people safe from coronavirus ""but this should be done in the full knowledge of the economic and social consequences"".

Mary-Ann Russon,"Image copyright Emma Hopkinson-Spark Image caption Smile Bank customer Emma Hopkinson-Spark left the bank on Friday due to the ongoing probelms

Smile Bank customers have been unable to access their online banking accounts for five days in a row.

The online-only bank, owned by Co-Operative Bank, said it was working urgently to resolve the problem.

But the latest service outage proved to be the ""last straw"" for longtime customer Emma Hopkinson-Spark.

After 16 years, she left Smile Bank on Friday after she was unable to view a crucial re-mortgage payment.

""I'm really disappointed in Smile Bank,"" Ms Hopkinson-Spark, chief of staff at a tech consultancy business in Weston-super-Mare, told the BBC. ""The outages this week were the tipping point.""

Ms Hopkinson-Spark said she had not been able to access her online banking account for several days. Although she can still withdraw money from cash machines and pay for items using her debit card, she cannot send payments or view her payments.

""Yesterday my husband rang me in a flap saying he was trying to pay for groceries and didn't have money in his account,"" she said. ""He needed me to transfer money to his account and I couldn't.""

Her frustration came to a head when her mortgage firm said they had sent a payment of almost £100,000 to her current account, but she could not see it there or do anything with the funds.

She decided to close her current account, cash ISA and savings account with the bank and is transferring her funds to a different bank.

Smile Bank, which has around 100,000 customers, has apologised for problems with its online banking and mobile app, but it was unable to provide the BBC with a reason for the outage, or say when the problem would be fixed.

Image copyright Smile Bank Image caption Customers have complained that Smile Bank is not communicating with them about the outages

""We're sorry that our Smile customers have been unable to use our mobile app and online banking as they would usually in recent days,"" the company said in a statement.

""We are working hard to restore their access as soon as possible and we apologise for any inconvenience caused.

""Customers can use their cards and make transactions as normal and if they need support with their account they can call our customer service team.""

'We're getting really panicked'

Vicky Wevell, a self-employed editor in Nailsea, near Bristol who has been with the bank for 20 years, said Smile Bank's mobile app had gone downhill in recent years, with outages for hours at a time.

Like other Smile Bank customers who spoke to the BBC, she said a lack of communication during the recent issues had made her worried about the safety of her funds.

""I'm really angry actually and have been getting progressively angrier this week,"" she said. ""It's less to do with the outage and more to do with their communication.""

She said she was also on the verge of switching banks, because she could not see which invoices for work done had been paid by her clients.

""How are we supposed to do any business?"" she said. ""[We're] getting really panicked, is our money secure?""

Making enquiries

Jackie Smart, an office administrator in Aylesbury, said it took days for the bank to put a notice up about the outage on its website and communication remains difficult.

""I'm feeling frustrated and worried because I don't know what's happening. You can get through on the automated service to hear your balance when you ring through, but it's actually waiting to speak to somebody that takes a long time,"" she said.

Set up in 1999, Smile Bank was one of the earliest online-only banks. Its parent company, Co-Operative Bank, is owned by a number of hedge funds, which last year were reportedly exploring a sale of the business.

The BBC understands that the outage is caused by an issue that is only affecting Smile Bank's platforms, but not other brands owned by Co-Operative Bank.

Smile Bank customers have been advised to call the bank if they require assistance with their accounts on 03457 212212 during opening times, which are: Monday-Friday 08:00-18:00 BST, and on weekends between 09:00-17:00 BST.

More than 100 holiday companies have been told to speed up their refunds policy for coronavirus cancellations.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has received more than 17,500 complaints from people whose holidays have been hit by the virus.

In an open letter from the CMA, companies have been reminded of the 14-day refund rule for cancellations.

Travel firms say this has been an unprecedented crisis that put many of them on the brink of collapse.

Consumers' rights

By law, if a package holiday is cancelled by the provider, then a refund should be provided for the whole holiday within 14 days.

Many thousands of getaways were cancelled during lockdown, when the Foreign Office advised against all but essential travel outside of the UK.

The CMA said its investigations found that some businesses may not have been giving these legally-required refunds.

Other problems included:

Holidaymakers only being offered a voucher for future travel, rather than a full refund

Customers losing their deposits or being charged cancellation fees

Companies misleading customers about their rights

People finding it difficult to contact travel companies or to claim refunds

In the letter, CMA director Cecilia Parker Aranha said the regulator recognised the ""extraordinary pressures"" faced by the sector.

""Although we were sympathetic to the challenges faced in the early days of the pandemic, it is nonetheless important that businesses comply with consumer law,"" she added.

Image copyright Getty Images

A spokeswoman for Abta, which represents the package holiday sector, said the pressures were continuing and that many companies, with loyal customers, had mutually agreed to a rebooked holiday rather than a refund.

She said Abta had conducted its own investigations of members when customers had been misled.

However, she added that package holiday companies were themselves facing delays from airlines in refunding them the flight element of any holiday.

""Many airlines, in particular, have been and continue to be very slow in passing refunds back to package holiday businesses, which means that those package holiday businesses are unable to refund their customers as promptly as they would wish,"" she said.

""It is essential, therefore, that effective regulatory action is taken against the airlines that are not currently refunding with seven days, as required under relevant consumer protection legislation.""

Airlines are regulated by the Civil Aviation Authority which has been putting pressure on companies to comply.

If I go walk my dog, I have to change my clothes when I get back because they smell.

Every day in winter, 16-year-old Barsov opens the AirCare app on his phone and checks the pollution levels around him. “There are two sensors close to my house and it’s always really polluted in winter,” Barsov tells me. If he sees a green circle, the air around him is reasonably clean. If it’s yellow, there’s some pollution but it doesn’t break EU limits. If it’s red or darker, pollution is over the limit, and hazardous to health.

The app has become an essential tool to Barsov, and many others in the city, for understanding where the pollution is and exactly how bad it is. As a result, it has sparked growing awareness, and concern, about the city’s air.

“A lot of people use the app, my uncle has asthma and he’s always checking it,” says Barsov, who is a member of the local Fridays for Future chapter, a global youth movement for action on climate change. “There’s been a lot more awareness over the past few years, and I feel we’re building a movement.”

Stav Dimitropoulos,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The technology used in computer games is changing the way films are made, says Kim Libreri

Kim Libreri, an award-winning visual effects artist based in Northern California, has worked on movies including Artificial Intelligence and War of the Planet of the Apes.

For nine years he has been working with a piece of technology better known for computer games, in particular the smash-hit Fortnite.

The Unreal Engine, owned by Epic Games, provides the building blocks and tools that a computer game developer needs, but is increasingly an attractive technology for TV and film producers.

The latest version of technology, Unreal Engine 5, is coming out next year, and Epic has been heavily trailing its features.

It should allow visual effects artists like Mr Libreri to slot graphics and images straight into a scene, with little fuss.

""With traditional filmmaking, a director and cinematographer might shoot a scene on set -then down the line, hand footage and creative direction off to a team of virtual reality artists and designers, who enhance that material with visual effects and computer-generated imagery in a separate phase of production, says Mr Libreri, who is now chief technology officer at Epic Games.

Image copyright Epic Games Image caption Directors can play with lighting and other effects inside a games engine

With Unreal Engine collaboration between the director, cinematographer, production designer and virtual reality teams can occur simultaneously as an interactive process on set.

""Unreal Engine 5 promises to further free the artistic process by making it easier to take virtual worlds developed for feature film and television, and run them in the game engine in real time,"" says Mr Libreri.

Anthony Hunt, is the chief executive of Cinesite, a multinational digital entertainment group, whose visual effects film work includes blockbusters such as Avengers: Endgame, Independence Day: Resurgence, Iron Man 3 and more.

More Technology of Business

His company recently used Unreal Engine on a live stunt show for a theme park, which includes chase scenes, punishing fistfights, and death-defying leaps.

""It all happens right in front of you with live performers, interactive props and an immense LED screen - making it impossible to determine where the live-action ends and the screen begins,"" says Mr Hunt.

The film industry has long borrowed tech from the computer games industry.

Games production processes like mapping out scenes in 3D through photography, storyboards and animatics run on similar systems to those used to build games.

But the challenges of producing films and television under lockdown restrictions is likely to accelerate the use of games technology.

Image copyright PARAMOUNT PICTURES Image caption Dodger Stadium was recreated for Rocketman

For example game engines are particularly good for generating big crowd scenes.

""An extra has to be fed and clothed and housed on a film set. We can replicate huge crowd scenes with computer technology now and just have our main actors in the foreground,"" says Mr Hunt.

A good example of this a scene in Rocketman, the musical fantasy about Elton John's breakthrough years.

One scene was set in Dodger Stadium, but in reality actor Taron Egerton performed the scene at Shepperton Studios. The crowds used were 3D graphics designed to be parts of a larger scene.

Computer-generated scenery can be combined with LED walls - giant screens made up of individual displays.

""LED walls are becoming more popular in film and television production because they allow filmmakers to capture visual effects in camera, and manipulate digital objects in a scene in real time,"" says Mr Libreri.

""LED panels as those we've seen with Disney's The Mandalorian (a science fiction TV series and part of the Star Wars family) will be a huge benefit to on-set production once restrictions start to lift, as filmmakers can reduce travel by creating photorealistic digital backgrounds to mimic any location,"" he continues.

Image copyright Disney/Lucasfilms Image caption Disney's Mandalorian used a games engine and LED walls

""When the physical filming restrictions are lifted, directors will have a clear plan of what and how to shoot their film/TV series because they will have done so in the computer already,"" says Mr Hunt.

What will all this mean to the actors, crew and support staff who work in the industry?

""There is a possibility that production crew needs will alter somewhat. Some roles may change with the ongoing use of CGI, perhaps other roles will be created,"" Daniel Green, director of the Master of Entertainment Industry Management Program at Carnegie Mellon University says.

When production returns to normal, the industry will need to be unified and make changes to assure that safety is paramount says Dr Green.

Studio executives and producers will no longer be making decisions solely based on artistic vision and production costs.

""They will now be in close consultation with public health officials to make sure that crews, actors, and staff can have a work environment that is safe and secure,"" he says.

Mr Green also points out that CGI creates realistic worlds which are fun, but good story-telling is still the key.

""The use of CGI and virtual production as in The Lion King remake can augment what can be shown on the screen, but at the end of the day, audiences are still going to want to be entertained by a story that captivates them.""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption James Dean on the set of Giant

Travis Cloyd, chief technology officer of CMG Worldwide, a company that represents 1,700 celebrities, athletes, musicians, brands and historical figures, sees another use for games engines.

A great business opportunity lies in ""resurrecting"" historical figures and famous people of the past like James Dean or Rosa Parks via digital twins, according to Mr Cloyd.

""These famous people have a prebuilt awareness,"" he says. ""They will always resonate with the audiences and the expansion of new platforms amidst the pandemic will bring new opportunities to use them in a plethora of media,"" Mr Cloyd says.

Technology like the Unreal Engine is likely to be used in that process.

Movie making is of course a business, so the hope will be that new technology will save time and money.

""Fewer things will need to be worked out on set and in post-production, and there will be less need for travel and expensive location shoots,"" says Mr Libreri.

""Once people experience this new way of working,"" Mr Libreri continues, ""they will find that it is much more efficient and cost-effective"".

Andrea Marechal Watson,"The problem is particularly acute in the UK where escalating house prices have resulted in the rise of the boomerang generation – kids who come back to the family nest for economic reasons. In addition to the boomerangs – many of them graduates paying off student loans – we have the stickarounds, children living at home well into their 30s because it is the only chance of scraping together a deposit to buy a home of their own. And on top of this lot are separated or divorced families, as well as a rising tide of grannies and grandads. New research from investment broker Charles Stanley finds the desire to avoid escalating retirement or care-home costs is driving this trend.

There is however only so much space below stairs and under rooves that the typical home can make available to all these extra residents, so it comes as little surprise that a survey by Propertyheads.com found that interest in the ‘granny annexe’ has increased. According to the site: “After analysing the results of over 3,000 searches conducted during March and April 2020, some interesting patterns emerged which show how buyer behaviour has already started to change ahead of the easing of lockdown restrictions. The results revealed that searches for granny annexes were up by 16%, suggesting that the forced separation from older parents has made many realise that having them close by and ideally in a building attached to the same property is now a key factor in future property purchases.”

But what is really needed are not annexes but a fundamental rethink of housing and planning, and it is already happening across Europe and the US. In Germany, projects include the Mehrgenerationhaus (multi-generation house) programme, while Holland’s government has set a goal of creating 500,000 multi-generational homes by 2040. Initiatives in the UK include the Don’t Move Improve scheme and Superbia, a strategy to increase housing by using overlooked small sites such as gardens and rooftops in London’s suburban areas.

These are tense times for Huawei and the UK's telecoms providers.

The prime minister will shortly review use of the Chinese company's equipment, with MPs set to be informed of his decision on Tuesday.

It seems likely that Boris Johnson will set a deadline by which time the firm should stop being involved in the country's 5G network. But what's unclear is whether he'll also order it to be stripped out of other mobile and fixed-line broadband systems too.

The decision will not only have an impact on the rollout of high-speed data services but could also encourage other countries to rethink their own relationships with Huawei.

What are the options?

In January, the government ordered that Huawei's market share of 5G and fibre-to-the-premises (FTTP) broadband be capped at 35%, and that it also be removed from the most sensitive part of mobile networks, known as the core.

Since then ministers have said that ""over time"" they want high-risk vendors - including Huawei - to be excluded outright, but have not said by when.

Some of the UK's mobile networks have already spent large sums installing Huawei masts and other equipment to connect smartphones to their 5G networks.

Image copyright Huawei Image caption Huawei claims to have the most advanced 5G kit - but the US sanctions threaten its ability to make it

They have said they want about seven years to replace it with another option if they must, and at a push could do it in five.

But some Tory MPs say the deed must be done before 2024's general election.

The networks claim this would be difficult, not least because today's 5G base stations are often upgrades of existing 4G kit. So the swap to another supplier is a bigger job than it might seem as it involves replacing much of their 4G infrastructure too.

In regard to broadband, BT's Openreach division will bear the brunt of any decision.

It currently aims to meet the cap by using two other vendors to build new FTTP capacity rather than by replacing any existing Huawei equipment, which would involve extra cost and effort.

And then there's the nuclear option.

If Mr Johnson wants Huawei out of the telecoms network altogether, then 70,000 roadside cabinets used to provide existing broadband connections would also need to be refitted.

At that point, the sums and work involved start to become colossal.

Why is this happening?

Geopolitical tension between the US and China is the reason behind the review into the use of Huawei's technology.

Washington claims Huawei poses a national security risk and has unfairly benefited from government support. Whether these claims are true - and Huawei denies them - the Trump administration clearly sees the company as a totem for the spread of Chinese influence, and is trying to push back.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Huawei's success as one of China's biggest brands has also meant that its actions and finances face additional scrutiny

Its latest move is sanctions designed to prevent the firm from being able to get its own chips manufactured.

Neither Huawei nor the third-party fabricators it relies on would be allowed to use American electronic design automation (EDA) software - which is used to design, simulate and produce the firm's processors - or any other tool based on American intellectual property,

At present there is no quick way to get round this, leading one of the world's biggest chip producers - TSMC - to stop taking new orders from the Chinese company.

With enough time, Huawei might convince manufacturers to run ""de-Americanised"" production lines.

But in some cases there are no easy substitutes. In particular, it would lose the ability to make chips as densely packed with transistors as is currently the case, meaning they would not work as efficiently.

As a result, Huawei may have to let others design and make the chips at the heart of its products.

However, UK security chiefs are concerned that this would prevent them being able to vet it equipment as thoroughly.

And it is believed GCHQ's National Cyber Security Centre has told politicians the balance of risk has shifted as a consequence.

One option that had been considered was for the government to advise - but not order - networks to stop using Huawei's kit.

But dozens of Tory MPs have made clear they would rebel unless a tougher line is taken.

Bob Seely - a member of the Huawei Interest Group of Conservative MPs - told the BBC he believes the government will announce that no new 5G Huawei kit can be installed after 2021, and all such equipment must be removed by the end of 2025.

""Not everyone would be satisfied by that,"" he said, but added that it would be enough to prevent the government losing a parliamentary vote.

What can Huawei do?

For now, the firm seems to be hoping it can sway the prime minister's mind at the eleventh hour.

Huawei can make the case that it has built up stockpiles of its chips and the sanctions allow foundries outside the US to continue making more until mid-September.

Moreover, it could promise to set aside some of that supply specifically to fulfil UK orders, and thus guarantee that it would not need to ship kit using third-party components to the country for at least two or three years - by which point the US sanctions might be over.

Image copyright TSMC Image caption TSMC has stopped taking new orders from Huawei's HiSilcon chip division

That might satisfy immediate security concerns, but the decision is also a political one.

Huawei hopes any new restrictions are accompanied by a pledge to carry out a follow-up review, leaving the door open to a further U-turn.

But in the light of tensions with China over its treatment of Hong Kong, Boris Johnson might not be in any mind to offer such a concession.

Huawei could still try to mount a legal challenge.

When asked about this possibility, its UK chief Victor Zhang said now was ""not the right time to make the case"" .

What would be the consequences for the UK?

Ericsson already supplies many of the UK networks with 5G kit and has said it can take on extra demand at a competitive price.

""Commercially, will it cost more? I can guarantee you no,"" the firm's European chief Arun Bansal told the BBC.

Nokia is another existing supplier that could pick up the slack. And - in time - there's also talk of bringing Samsung and NEC on board too.

But Vodafone has warned that unless operators are given at least seven years to pull Huawei out, then the further rollout of 5G will be slower than planned.

Likewise, Openreach believes it would struggle to meet the prime minister's 2025 target of ""gigabit broadband for all"" if it has to replace existing Huawei broadband gear.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Openreach's work to hit a 2025 deadline is already under pressure because of the coronavirus pandemic

There would also be wider ramifications.

Huawei would presumably rethink promises it has made to invest in R&D in the country, including plans for a £1bn development near Cambridge.

Furthermore, China's ambassador to the UK has said it would damage Britain's reputation for being a business-friendly, open nation.

""When you get rid of Huawei, it sends it a very wrong message. You punish your image as a country that can conduct independent policy,"" said Liu Xiaoming.

On the flipside, a ban might encourage the Trump administration to give the UK a free trade deal that would aid its post-Brexit fortunes.",Huawei: Why the UK might hang up on 5G and broadband kit supplier,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-53341080,2020-07-10
Jonathan Amos,"Image copyright ONEWEB Image caption Artwork: Bharti and the UK government are each putting in $0.5bn (£400m)

The sale of the failed satellite company OneWeb to Bharti Global Ltd of India and the UK government has been approved by a US bankruptcy court.

The two parties' joint bid of $1bn (£800m) secures them the firm's assets.

It means OneWeb will soon be able to resume building a space network capable of delivering broadband internet connections to all parts of the globe.

Ministers hope the resurrected firm can also transmit navigation signals as an alternative to the EU's Galileo system.

Britain walked away from involvement in the European project when it ceased to be a Union member state in January.

Friday's hearing, held under the auspices of the US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, was a key procedural moment in OneWeb's efforts to restore itself to financial health after running out of funds in March this year.

The company issued a statement in which it said: ""The parties will work to complete the plan sale process, including filing our plan and disclosure statements with the court, conducting voting with our creditors, and seeking regulatory approval and completing customary closing conditions, and expect the process to be completed by the fourth quarter of 2020.""

Image copyright ONEWEB Image caption The OneWeb HQ in west London has a control room to monitor and command satellites

OneWeb, which has its HQ in west London and parallel operations in Virginia, US, still has considerable challenges in front of it.

The rescue plan presented to the New York court on Friday only provides about $640m to take the business forward - after various settlement costs are taking into consideration.

Prior to seeking bankruptcy protection, the company had launched 74 satellites for a designed constellation of 648.

Manufacturing the remaining spacecraft and getting them all into orbit on a string of rockets will require additional investment that's been estimated by independent analysts to be in the region of at least $2bn. New commercial partners will therefore be needed.

The UK government's interest in OneWeb became public knowledge at the end of June. The merits of getting involved have attracted both support and criticism, with some describing the intervention as bold and others decrying what they believe will turn out to be a lost investment.

So far, ministers have revealed little of their intentions for OneWeb, although Business Secretary Alok Sharma told MPs this week that using the company's constellation for satellite navigation was not its prime consideration.

The greater motivation to back OneWeb, he said, came from a desire to see improved access to broadband internet in remote areas, and, in strategic terms, to raise the ambitions of the UK in space.

""I think there's been debate around [a Global Navigation Satellite System], and that wasn't the rationale for this particular investment. But of course, we are exploring how OneWeb... may be able to contribute to Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) resilience in the future,"" he explained during questions from the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (Beis) Committee of the House of Commons.

Image copyright OneWeb Image caption Artwork: The government says its principal interest is broadband connectivity

Eyebrows have been raised about the prospect of using OneWeb for satellite navigation. The company's planned constellation was designed with a very different purpose in mind and adapting it to take on this further role will not be straightforward.

But there is growing interest in doing PNT at lower altitudes than is traditionally the case with satellite systems like Galileo and the Americans' GPS network, whose spacecraft fly at over 20,000km in altitude.

OneWeb's spacecraft operate at 1,200km and sat-nav signals transmitted from this height would potentially be stronger and more robust in the face of efforts to jam or otherwise interfere with them.

Xona Space Systems is a US start-up working to develop a low-Earth orbit PNT solution with a 300-strong small satellite constellation.

It recently received pre-seed funding from the British space-specialist venture-capital operation Seraphim.

The company's CTO Tyler Reid told BBC News this week that its patent pending technology was aiming to achieve centimetre-level accuracies - the sort performance that will be needed by self-driving cars.

""Autonomous systems are reliant on precise location. To do that job and to do it well you really need to know your position down to the level of the paint on the road,"" he said.

""The width of the paint on the road is 10cm and that's really the level of the interaction of these vehicles.""

It sounds too good to be true: free money to make your home cosy and cut your fuel bills.

But this is exactly what is planned for England's homeowners from September.

That's when the government aims for a triple whammy - creating thousands of jobs in home insulation while reducing carbon emissions from boilers and shaving energy bills.

Campaigners call this £2bn scheme a ""no brainer"" policy. So what will it mean for you?

Green homes grant

The Green Homes Grant - which was revealed in Chancellor Rishi Sunak's summer statement - will be available via a website in two months' time.

You will apply for a voucher of up to £5,000 worth of work, of which you will pay one third or less.

If your income is low, you will get £10,000 worth of work and you won't pay a thing.

A qualified retrofit coordinator will visit your home and assess how you can reduce your need for heating.

Then the work will be done. Your home should be warmer in winter and cooler in summer.

What improvements can you get?

We are awaiting details from the government, but it looks as though the scheme may cover:

Loft insulation

Wall insulation

Underfloor insulation

Double and triple glazing

Eco-friendly boilers, heat pumps, low-energy lighting and energy-efficient doors

The scheme will apparently involve a ""whole house approach"", whereby a retrofit co-ordinator will determine what measures will ensure the best value for money for you and the taxpayer in your home.

It could mean your refurbishment priority list starts off with loft insulation, then wall insulation, then underfloor insulation, for instance.

Experts debate whether double and triple glazing should have qualified for the scheme.

These windows often impress the neighbours, but some think it offers relatively poor value for money when it comes to saving energy.

Will home owners have to deal with lots of contractors?

Again, we need details. But it is clear many small firms are only certified by their trade organisation to carry out work within their field of expertise.

For instance, I rang a specialist in underfloor spray insulation, to ask if he could stop draughts letting in cold air from my timber floor. He said yes.

I also enquired if he could also install those fiddly insulating strips on doors and doors. He said no.

Will the retrofit co-ordinator handle all the trades people you will need? This is yet to be decided.

How complicated is insulation?

Well, simple draught-proofing may be tedious but it is effective and the choices on offer are limited. But other forms of insulation generate a blizzard of possibilities.

With solid walls, should you insulate inside - which shrinks your room size? Or should you do it outside - which usually makes your house look different?

For suspended wooden floors, should you get a robot to spray under the boards? Or lift the boards and fit foam blocks between the rafters? Or should you use natural insulation based on the cannabis plant, hemp?

Hopefully the retrofit co-ordinator will help you choose.

What could go wrong?

The last time the government tried a big energy saving scheme - the Green Deal - it exploded in their faces.

Unlike this new plan, nothing was free. Instead householders were offered loans with interest so high they would have saved money going to the bank manager.

Some of the small number of people who took up the scheme found dreadful faults. Insulation badly installed can create damp.

Unsurprisingly, the scheme was scrapped.

But that has led to another problem. An industry had grown up with a workforce to provide insulation but as installation numbers collapsed, that industry has shrunk.

Can it be resurrected by September?

One expert said it could take between six and 12 months to set up a watertight scheme yet the government wants all the £2bn fund spent by the end of March.

What guarantee will there be for home owners?

This is a crucial issue. The most successful warm homes schemes worldwide have been when experts visited your home after the work was done to check you're satisfied.

Joanne Wade from the energy conservation specialists ADE said: ""We're going to need much better quality control than the Green Deal had.

""If there's something wrong it'll have to be fixed or consumers will lose faith in the scheme and turn their backs on it.""

Is the scheme ambitious enough?

Some green groups say the £2bn figure is inadequate. But experts who've been campaigning on the issue for decades say it's probably about right, as it will be hard to get all the money spent in the time available anyway.

But they insist that the same amount of cash must be spent year on year and extra private investment has to be attracted too.

Without that, they say, the government won't sustain the jobs, won't meet its target for warm homes and won't meet its goals for cutting carbon emissions either.

Jane Wakefield,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Jack Dorsey says the idea is ""one tool"" to address inequality of income, race and gender

Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey has become the first investor in a radical plan to give people a basic income, regardless of job status.

He has donated $3m (£2.4m) to the scheme, which is being piloted by the mayors of 16 US cities.

He said it was ""one tool to close the wealth and income gap"".

The idea of governments paying a basic income to citizens has gained momentum in response to the threat to jobs from artificial intelligence.

The premise of universal basic income (UBI) is that every individual in a country will receive a cash payment at regular intervals, without any requirement to work or qualify for it. The payment would be given to every citizen, regardless of wealth or employment status.

The US scheme, dubbed Mayors for a Guaranteed Income, is a version of this which would offer a recurring payment, but only to ""some"" residents.

On its website, it is not made explicit who will receive payments but it talks of the need to address poverty, particularly in the light of the coronavirus pandemic.

""Covid-19 has only further exposed the economic fragility of most American households and has disproportionately impacted black and brown people,"" it says.

""Mayors will come together in this network to advocate for a guaranteed income - direct, reccuring cash payments - that lifts all of our communities, building a resilient, just America.""

There are no firm proposals for how money would be allocated, or for how long the scheme would last.

Mr Dorsey tweeted: ""This is one tool to close the wealth and income gap, level systemic race and gender inequalities and create economic security for families"".

The project was founded by Stockton mayor Michael Tubbs, who wants it to become a national programme that will extend beyond the current pandemic.

He has previously said that raising taxes of individuals such as Mr Dorsey could be one way to fund it.

The 29-year-old is attempting to reinvent the Californian city he grew up in and has been experimenting with the idea of a universal income since 2018, paying $500 a month to 125 residents.

Joblessness threat

Talk of a universal basic income has been around for decades but has become closely associated with the idea of artificial intelligence - the argument being that as robots take over more jobs in society, humans will need a guaranteed annual income supplied by government.

But Martin Luther King also suggested the idea in his 1967 book Where Do We Go From Here?

AI expert Calum Chace said that a universal basic income could be some way off.

""It is seen by many as a solution to the threat of joblessness as machines automate more and more of our jobs in the coming years and decades,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, it is wholly unaffordable if it offers anything more than abject poverty.

""But if, say, [in] a generation from now machines do take most of our jobs, we should all be able to live the lives of leisure that economists like Maynard Keynes promised long ago - if, that is, we can achieve the economy of abundance, where the cost of a very good standard of living falls close to zero.

So much for a summer lull in the coronavirus pandemic. Instead, the US has seen a resurgence of the disease in numerous states, particularly across the south and west.

The US nation as a whole has topped 60,000 recorded daily new cases this week.

Did it have to be this way, though?

Other industrialised nations, in Europe and Asia, pursued more rigorous mitigation plans, ramped up testing and contact tracing earlier, and eased restrictions in a slower and more co-ordinated fashion.

They have not, at least so far, seen a resurgence of the virus similar to the one the US is currently experiencing.

The US state of Arizona, for instance, is currently registering as many new cases of coronavirus as the entire European Union, which has a population 60 times greater.

It makes for a gloomy review of what's gone right and (mostly) wrong, as the US enters its fifth full month of a pandemic that has no end in sight.

WHAT'S GONE WRONG

States opened too quickly

A month ago, the coronavirus numbers in the US appeared, at the very least, stable. The spread of the disease had been slowed, as the daily tally of new cases plateaued.

That prompted a number of states - including Texas, California, Florida and Arizona - to move forward with plans to ease off public shelter-in-place and business closure orders.

Many of these states moved ahead despite not hitting the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended benchmarks for doing so, such as a 14-day drop in cases and less than 5% of tests coming back positive for the virus.

It turns out, the overall national numbers were misleading, as states that were hit hard early, such as New York and New Jersey, were experiencing declines, while numbers in other states were beginning to inch up.

They're not inching up anymore, they're surging - and the worst, as far as hospitalisations and fatalities, could be yet to come.

Now Texas, California and Arizona, among others, have re-imposed business closure orders and mandated mask-wearing, which has been determined to reduce the spread of the virus. It may be too little to avoid another public-health crisis, however.

""We opened way too early in Arizona,"" Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego, a Democrat, said in recent television interview. ""We were one of the last states to go to stay-at-home and one of the first to re-emerge.""

The 8,181 Covid-19 hospitalisations in Texas on Sunday were yet another record high. In Arizona, 14% of coronavirus tests are positive for the virus.

California, an early success story in limiting the spread of the virus, has seen a 90% increase in cases over the past two weeks, after the state in May allowed local authorities more discretion in businesses re-openings.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Why coronavirus cases are surging in Texas

The surge in cases is also again leading to delays and shortages in testing - an area that had appeared to be a strength for the US after a halting start.

Without adequate testing, it will be significantly more difficult to identify and isolate new cases and locations where the virus is spreading unchecked.

""We're right back where we were at the peak of the epidemic during the New York outbreak,"" former Food and Drug Administration commissioner Scott Gottlieb said during a television interview on Sunday.

At least for the moment, the rate of daily deaths has not reached New York levels - but that may only be a matter of time, as the current cases progress.

""It is already too late,"" says Luiza Petre, a New York City physician and professor of cardiology at the Mt Sinai School of Medicine. ""We're at a point of no return where it will be very, very difficult to restrain this pandemic.""

Mask-wearing became partisan

Compounding the decision by some states to prioritise reopening in spite of warnings from public-health officials, one of the best methods of limiting the spread of the virus - wearing a face covering - has become mired in partisan acrimony.

A June survey by Pew Research Center found that only 49% of conservative Republicans said they wore a mask most of the time in the past month, while that number is 83% among liberal Democrats.

Conservative opposition becomes even more entrenched at the prospect of government-enforced mask mandates.

""Kansans don't need Laura Kelly and the nanny state making decisions best left to individuals,"" Bill Clifford, a Republican congressional candidate in Kansas, said in response to a mask order from his state's Democratic governor. ""State mask mandates violate the principles of individual liberty and local control upon which America was founded.""

Donald Trump himself has contributed to the division, mocking a reporter who refused to remove his mask during a press conference as being ""politically correct"" and retweeting a Fox News journalist who suggested a photo of Joe Biden in a mask was damaging to the Democrat's image.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Few Trump supporters wore masks at his Tulsa rally

The president has steadfastly refused to wear a mask in public events - a position that has clearly registered with his supporters. At the president's campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in June, few in the crowd chose to use face-coverings, and most disregarded social-distancing suggestions.

Public-health officials aren't free from blame, either. Early on, they declared that face-coverings were only helpful for front-line medical personnel.

While the real motivation for such statements may have been to reserve limited supplies to those most in need, the end result was a message that was muddled and shifted as the pandemic progressed.

Public complacency

While some state governments have eased restrictions on public gatherings and allowed businesses to re-open, they have frequently accompanied such moves with recommendations that individuals make decisions based on medical advice and common sense.

Those recommendations have been, to put it mildly, not always heeded.

Summer holidays led to mask-less crowds in reopened bars and restaurants, public parks and beaches. And while masks were a fairly common sight during the mass anti-discrimination protests that swept the nation in the past month, social-distancing practices were essentially non-existent.

The numbers behind this new coronavirus surge indicates that many of the newly infected are younger Americans, who have been among the quickest to return to in-personal socialising. Some political leaders, including the president, have essentially encouraged this, asserting that the young and healthy have little to fear from the virus.

""Now we have tested over 40 million people,"" Trump tweeted on Saturday. ""But by so doing, we show cases, 99% of which are totally harmless.""

That flies in the face of public-health studies that have shown that a fifth of Covid-19 cases result in severe respiratory distress.

""We have data in the White House task force,"" US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn on Sunday, refusing to reject Trump's 99% figure as false. ""Those data show us that this is a serious problem. People need to take it seriously.""

But a president downplaying the severity of the disease can go a long way toward undermining words of warning from his subordinates.

Education approaching crisis

The coronavirus resurgence has also lit the fuse on a bomb that is set to explode in just a few months. September is when American children traditionally head back to classrooms across the nation, and it's becoming clear that nothing close to a normal educational experience is waiting for them.

School administrators are starting to unveil their plans for the coming academic year, and in many cases it's a blend of in-person and distance learning with the hope that it's enough to keep their institutions from becoming staging grounds for spreading the pandemic.

Already some teachers' unions are rebelling at the suggestion that educators - including elderly or those at greater health risk - return to classrooms with what they view as insufficient protection or preparation.

""Our educators are overwhelmingly not comfortable returning to schools,"" wrote the head of a Washington DC area teachers' union. ""They fear for their lives, the lives of students and the lives of their families.""

Meanwhile, parents facing the prospect of having to manage more de-facto home-schooling and figuring out how to care for and supervise their children while they, themselves, are being asked to return to their workplaces.

Trump, despite campaigning in 2016 against federal involvement in local education systems, is already pressuring schools to open back up on time. He's called for the CDC to revise its guidance to make it easier to reopen school buildings and threatened to cut off federal funds for those that don't comply.

Florida, a Republican-controlled state currently in the midst of a widespread coronavirus outbreak, already has ordered its schools to open for classes at the end of August.

The president's rhetoric, delivered via Twitter, seems destined to politicise yet another aspect of the coronavirus response, again putting local officials in the unenvious position of balancing community health concerns with demands to return to normal times that seem increasingly out of reach.

WHAT'S GONE RIGHT

New York recovery

Although the coronavirus situation in many US states in the south and west has become increasingly dire, what was once the epicentre of the outbreak - New York - has made remarkable improvements.

Daily deaths, which peaked on 8 April at 799, have dropped to single digits. Only 1.38% of the state's coronavirus testing last Friday returned positive results.

As other areas have re-imposed lockdown restrictions, New York has begun reopening many public facilities and private business such as salons, tattoo shops and youth sport leagues. Indoor restaurants, however, remain closed.

""What happened in New York should have been a cautionary tale for the other states to pay attention and learn to create a more centralised strategy,"" says Ms Petre, the New York City cardiologist. ""New York is a success story.""

As the state continues to ease its mitigation restrictions, there is the risk that the virus will return resurgent.

""We've been through hell and back, but this is not over,"" said New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. ""This can still rear its ugly head anywhere in this nation and in this state.""

Economy stabilised - for now

A funny thing happened on the way to the next Great Depression. The US economy, expected by many forecasters to be in a devastating tailspin, stabilised and began to improve.

May unemployment figures, predicted to top 20%, registered at 13.3% instead. Then, in June, they ticked down to 11.4% - an indication that the workplace haemorrhaging had been stopped much earlier than expected.

Meanwhile, key stock indices have bounced back from their late winter beating. By 2 July, the Dow Jones Industrial Index had recovered 66% of its losses from its February record high. The Standards & Poor's 500 Index, a broader measure of stocks, has made up 77% of its losses this year.

What Anthony wrote in April and May

Other economic indicators offer similar signs of an economic resurgence.

The strength of the recovery has largely been attributed to the push by states to quickly lift virus mitigation orders and federal action to provide economic support for businesses and individuals hit hardest by the virus.

The return of business closures in several states could mean the economic good news will be short-lived.

Meanwhile, most of the stimulus measures passed by Congress have either run their course or are set to expire soon, while there appears little prospect of further action.

""Since it is now clear that the effects of this crisis will be felt at least until the end of 2020, that relief package will not be enough,"" says Jill Gonzales, an analyst with the personal finance website Wallethub.

Science advancing

While the coronavirus afflicts a growing number of US states, the American medical community continues to grind away at treatments and, ultimately, a vaccine.

Remdesivir, an antiviral drug, has shown promise in limiting the severity of the disease in hospitalised patients (prompting the US government to strike a deal with the drug's manufacturer to prioritise American patients).

A new study indicates that the commonly available steroid dexamethasone cut the risk of death for coronavirus patients on ventilators by a third.

There are also ""encouraging signs"" from experts that the use of blood plasma from recovered Covid-19 patients could help those currently suffering from the disease, although clinical research is ongoing.

""Medicine has evolved at lightning speed,"" says Ms Petre. ""The government has teamed up with pharmaceutical companies and a lot has been done, which is good""

On the vaccine front, there are now several pharmaceutical companies reporting positive results from early tests on drugs to boost immunity to the coronavirus.

The president is promising a vaccine by the end of the year, if not earlier, although medical professionals caution that such a timeline is far from certain.

Anthony Fauci, the chief US immunologist, would only say scientists are ""aspirationally hopeful"" that a vaccine would be ready by 2021.

Given that a return to normal life in the US appears increasingly contingent on a safe and reliable vaccine, a lot is riding on these hopes.",Coronavirus: Things US has got wrong,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-53337483,2020-07-10
Katya Adler,"Image copyright EPA Image caption Unlike the recent videoconference, leaders plan to meet face-to-face - Covid-19 permitting

So the ""tiger in the tank"" (Prime Minister Boris Johnson's words) of EU-UK post-Brexit trade talks is all geared up to pounce.

Monday sees the start of a month of intensified negotiations between the two sides. This will include weekly meetings - at times in London, at others, in Brussels. And the first face-to-face talks since the Covid-19 pandemic hit Europe, infecting the EU and the UK's chief negotiators.

The idea of revving up the frequency of negotiating rounds was given a blessing at the highest political level a couple of weeks ago, when the prime minister held a summit via video link with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

Both sides have underlined their commitment to agreeing and ratifying a deal by the end of the year.

What can we expect after July's tiger pounce?

Well, the government wants to see the outline of an EU-UK trade deal by the end of the summer. This is in order to give UK businesses time to prepare themselves for a new working relationship with the EU, starting 1 January - after the transition period ends.

EU negotiators say they'll do their best.

Throughout this month, smaller groups of negotiators will focus on the main sticking points between the two sides- such as fishing and competition regulations, including environmental and - of key importance to the EU - state aid rules.

The hope is that face-to-face talks will facilitate the odd informal chat over coffee or a cooling-off walk around the block, allowing negotiators the breathing space to find solutions, rather than each side continuing to parrot already well-known red lines at one another via Zoom chat or similar.

But it's not going to be easy

Posturing and/or parroting is pretty straight-forward. Agreeing political compromises is anything but.

You could say, if they were not willing to make concessions, neither the EU, nor the UK would have signed up to releasing tigers into tanks.

Or you could cynically note that neither side would want to be seen to be the one responsible for a politically and economically costly no-deal scenario come the end of this year.

Brussels has indicated that it is willing to be flexible, as long as principles are protected, like protecting the single market. But what does that mean in practice?

EU leaders say they have full confidence in their chief negotiator, Michel Barnier. But at their summit earlier this month, they demanded he keep them well-informed every step of the way.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The UK and EU have so far failed to agree on fishing and competition rules

The EU's eight coastal nations are wary. They want to keep pretty much the same fishing rights in UK waters they enjoyed while the UK was a member state. Mr Barnier has described theirs as a ""maximalist position"". The other 19 EU members won't want trade talks with the UK to collapse over fishing.

EU divisions are not something to celebrate

The EU's united front may come under some strain as the pressure grows to compromise with the UK.

Pragmatic Germany assumes the EU's rotating six month presidency this week. Chancellor Angela Merkel is clear - she has repeatedly insisted that she's not in favour of pursuing a UK deal ""at any price"".

But no-deal would be costly to German businesses and a blot on her political legacy. She may find herself having to reason with France's Emmanuel Macron, who - so far - has taken the toughest line in Brexit negotiations.

That Franco-German ""drama"", if it ever unfolds (and if it does, it will likely be limited in size and play out behind closed doors) is one lined up for next season.

The Germans have a timetable, too - for their EU presidency. This summer, they say, is dedicated to trying to get all EU members behind a common recovery fund to help European economies hardest hit by Covid-19. The focus won't be on post-Brexit relations until the autumn, says Berlin.

Despite the rhetoric about racing for a summer deal, that timeline may be more comfortable for the prime minister. He might feel full freedom to manoeuvre, considering his 80-seat parliamentary majority. But compromises may be easier for him to make in the autumn, with the clock ticking down to a potential no-deal - which much of UK industry and many MPs would oppose.

One thing for London to remember: an EU divided over concessions would not be something to celebrate. Every EU country and the European parliament will need to give the nod to a future relations agreement. Or there will be no deal at all.",Brexit: Will return of face-to-face talks mean progress?,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-53215711,2020-07-10

Ireland stands on the brink of putting climate change at the heart of its government if Green Party members vote in favour of a new coalition.

The new administration plans to ban fracked gas imports from the US, make steep cuts in emissions and end new drilling for oil and gas.

Agreed in talks with two larger parties, the plan now needs the support of two thirds of Green members.

But there is opposition, with some saying it is not progressive enough.

The results of voting are expected on Friday evening.

Ireland's reputation as a clean and green country has been tarnished in recent years by the inability of successive governments to tackle carbon emissions.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A big increase in the national dairy herd has helped boost Ireland's emissions

Compared to the rest of the EU, Ireland is the fourth largest emitter per capita.

An agreed EU target to cut carbon by 20% by this year was missed by a country mile.

The main problems have been in transport and agriculture, with a growing national dairy herd increasing by more than a quarter in the past five years.

Voter concern over climate change saw a significant improvement in Green Party representation in parliamentary elections held in February this year.

With no one winning an overall majority, the Greens' 12 seats made them a key partner in coalition talks, with the two largest traditional parties, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.

Delayed by the Covid-19 crisis, negotiators eventually produced an agreed programme for government.

The issues of climate change and sustainability are at the heart of it.

The proposed cuts in emissions will be enshrined in a Climate Action law, which will define how five-year carbon budgets will be set.

This idea, which would see Ireland's emissions cut by 51% by 2030, is similar to existing legislation in the UK, and has been welcomed by scientists.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Younger greens have been the ones most likely to oppose the programme for government

""The achievement of the 7% annual cut in emissions would be a scientifically acceptable solution at least in the short- and medium-term for Ireland, given that we have been flatlining our emissions and failing to meet the targets we have signed up to,"" said John Sweeney, emeritus professor of geography at Maynooth University.

""It has a very strong influence if you embrace the carbon budget principle. And I think that's what will drive the achievement of reductions here so I am quite happy from a scientific point of view.""

As well as banning the importation of fracked gas from US shale production, the programme would stall any future oil and gas drilling in Irish waters.

The programme is likely to be approved by members of the two bigger parties - but the Greens' high bar of two thirds support makes the whole project uncertain.

Some experts believe that failure to support the deal would be a calamity, as the programme, they argue, would usher in the greenest government in the history of the state.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Green Party leader Eamon Ryan has a fight on his hands to convince members to back the coalition

""It's completely transformational,"" said John Gibbons, an Irish journalist and long time climate commentator.

""What this delivers is a quantum shift in Ireland's climate response. A ban on fracked gas is incredibly important, as is the ban on oil and gas exploration, this is saying to the multinational fossil fuel industry, Ireland is now off limits.""

Despite the potential gains, within the Green movement there is considerable opposition from members who feel that it doesn't address issues of social justice, housing and economic strategy.

""There's a new generation of activists that believe in climate justice and they don't feel that you can separate issues around housing, issues around finance, issues around taxation from environmental concerns,"" said Neasa Hourigan, who is a new Green party TD (Member of Parliament).

While she helped negotiate the programme for government, she is now urging members to reject it.

""Until you address everything in terms of the fabric of how we operate as a society, then really what you're doing is just compartmentalising something into one area and that's not going to effect real climate action,"" she told BBC News.

""It has to be system change instead of climate change.""

Image copyright PA Image caption Actor Mark Ruffalo is also well known as an anti-fracking campaigner

With opposition from young people and members of the party in Northern Ireland, Green leaders have turned to Hollywood, enlisting actor and environmentalist Mark Ruffalo to encourage members to back the deal.

With the result said to be down to a handful of votes, there are worries that opponents of the programme based in the jurisdiction of Northern Ireland may scupper a plan that won't directly impact them.

Some commentators are urging Green members to keep their eye on the bigger picture.

""In a climate emergency when your house is on fire, you deal with the emergency and then when that's stabilised we'll get onto all the other good stuff,"" said John Gibbons.

""This is the best chance, it's out of sight in terms of anything that's ever been on the table.""

Before coronavirus offices were ""a mix of noise, distraction and an endless search for a free meeting room,"" he says.

However, that ""doesn't give you a single clue what to do to keep a tenant, no idea what these people do in the building, what they like and dislike, any tools to keep them,"" he says.

With millions of people working from home since the coronavirus pandemic, office owners will have to work harder to tempt them back.

""I popped in last week for a few hours, and saw some Star Trek-style sensors you wave your hand over to exit, rather than pressing a button,"" says Elizabeth Hoefsmit, managing director of Hampshire-based McGinley Aviation, which uses serviced offices in a business park.

It might be infrared temperature checks in the lobby, contactless lifts, or new apps to spread workers out and keep shared surfaces clean, but there's no doubt the post-coronavirus office is getting a drastic technological refit.

More Technology of Business

It could all start as soon as you wake up in the morning. You may check your building app, says David Garten, vice president at RXR Realty which owns and manages 93 properties in the New York area.

The firm's new app creates a building health index each day, from information like air quality, the number of occupants, and how well social distancing is being observed.

If your building has a low rating that day, you might decide to work from home, or go to a smaller satellite office instead.

The app will also tell you the ideal time to arrive, to reduce congestion, and people riding public transport at peak times. ""So the ideal time for me to walk through our lobby is 10am,"" says Mr Garten.

If a concierge judges you high risk from the infrared screening, they might double-check your temperature with a handheld device. Then, you might need to have your meeting by video conference from a quarantine room, or take a car home or to hospital.

If you make it through the lobby, then perhaps you will operate the lift with buttons on your app. Once upstairs, it will tell you when your workstation was last cleaned, Mr Garten says.

When it gets to lunchtime, you'll order food by an app, says John Robson, asset director at Workspace, which has 69 office properties around London focusing mainly on small companies.

""Every transaction is cashless now, and your food will basically be grab and go,"" he says.

If you pop to the loo after lunch, you'll be increasingly looking at touchless taps, Mr Lawrence says.

New software is helping companies spread people out.

Gensler's tool ReRun imports floor plans, calculates safe bubbles around each worker, and then outputs different ways to place workers so their bubbles do not overlap.

""Recently we did an analysis on a two million square-foot building that took roughly 10 days to turn around. Otherwise it would've taken several weeks,"" says Mr Lawrence.

For the same reason, some companies are looking to teach artificial intelligence (AI) to video cameras.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Artificial intelligence can look for office ""pinch points""

AI algorithms can offer feedback about ""pinch points"" where people are too close together, while protecting individual privacy, says Dr Mahesh Saptharishi, Motorola Solutions' chief technology officer, based in Boston.

Instead of watching the actual video, they can ask the AI how well social distancing is being observed overall, and where problem points are. ""So employees don't feel someone's watching what they do,"" he says.

Meanwhile, your cleaner might well be employee of the month for many months to come.

An April study in The Lancet Microbe showed the virus can last on plastic and stainless steel (like door handles) for up to seven days, and glass (like screens) for four days.

Cleaning wipes can disrupt the layer of fat that surrounds and protects coronavirus. And bleach's active ingredient sodium hypochlorite destroys the crown of protein spikes that gives the virus its name, and the ribonucleic acid (RNA) which is its blueprint to reproduce. So does the ethanol in surgical spirits.

But it would be helpful to know which surfaces should be cleaned.

Contact tracing needs to keep track of the surfaces and facilities you and sick colleagues used, says Matt Calkins, head of US software development platform Appian, which has also made coronavirus workplace safety software.

If you know which of your rooms to target, you know where best to send your deep cleaning team, and maximise use of your bleach, ethanol and wipes, Mr Calkins says.

The virus can also be carried in the air, on water droplets or fine dust particles, say researchers. So what about air conditioning systems?

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Office owners will be working hard to make their buildings attractive

The UK government says the risk of air conditioning spreading coronavirus in the workplace is ""extremely low"".

Nevertheless, ""we're advising organisations to look at their air conditioning system,"" says Dr Mark Parrish, Northern European medical director from International SOS, which advises companies about medical risks.

Filters with extremely narrow openings - like high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) and the more powerful ultra-low particulate air (ULPA) ones - can remove coronavirus from circulating in the air, according to UK air filter manufacturer SPCB.

The problem is such ventilation systems will normally need stronger fans to push air through these narrower filters, it says.

Upgrading air conditioning could be one of many options used by office owners to keep their tenants happy.

Maciej Markowski of spaceOS says simple convenience might be the winning factor.

""It's ridiculous that you're in a building and it's easier to order food from across town than the restaurant downstairs. Or with three taps on your phone you can tell Amazon a package is broken, but there's no way to tell your building there's a huge spill in front of your office.""",'Horrible' offices look to tempt back workers,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-53056585,2020-07-10
Will Smale,"Image copyright Sara Lando Image caption Andrew has expanded Keywords' workforce from 50 to 7,500

The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world. This week we speak to Andrew Day, chief executive of computer games developer Keywords Studios.

Andrew Day knows from personal experience just how addictive some computer games can be.

""I have one of those horrible personalities, that if I open a game, I find, before I know where I am, that I have spent tens of hours on it,"" says the 56-year-old.

""Back in 2013... I went for a little break, I was lying beside a swimming pool with nothing to do. So I picked up my phone and started playing Candy Crush.

""That was in June. I had to give it up in my New Year's resolutions the following year, because I was just losing so much time on the game. So yes, I have to be a little bit careful.""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Andrew says he was a big fan of Candy Crush

Andrew is chief executive of Irish company Keywords Studios. Even if you are an avid gamer, you might not have heard of the Dublin-based firm.

However, the business has helped make many of the world's most popular games - from Fortnite, to Clash of Clans, League of Legends, and Assassin's Creed.

""The full list of games we have worked on is slightly infinite,"" says Andrew.

Keywords employs 7,500 people at 59 offices around the world, from Montreal to Tokyo, and in 2019 it had annual revenues of €326.5m ($369m; £295m).

The business remains under the radar because it doesn't release games under its own name. Instead it is employed by the world's largest gaming companies to help them make their products.

It does everything from produce whole games, to parts of them, or handling the transfer from one platform to another, such as making an Xbox game work on a PlayStation.

Or it will design and make all the visual aspects of a game, everything you see, such as the characters, the buildings and weapons. ""All of those are digital assets, and they get produced by artists, and we are the largest providers of video games art in the world,"" says Andrew.

Image copyright Keywords Studios Image caption Keywords has staff around the world, including at its office in Mexico City, pictured

In addition, Keywords offers a testing service for nearly completed games, to check that they work correctly. And it has an audio business whereby actors - famous or not so famous - provide a game's voices and dialogue, and it adds all the music and sound effects.

Further, the company is the world's largest provider of games translation services - converting games into 50-plus languages.

Then after a game has been released, Keywords has staff who offer customer support under a client's name. So if you phone a gaming company demanding help to get you to the next level, you may actually be put through to Keywords employees.

It is a big operation for Andrew to lead, and while coronavirus has temporarily clipped his wings, he typically spends ""half my time"" travelling around the world.

It is a far cry from Keywords' humble beginnings in 1998, when a friend of Andrew's, Giorgio Guastalla, set up a small firm in Dublin offering translation services to business software providers. It grew slowly until Andrew was asked to join and lead the company in 2009, by which time it was solely operating in the gaming sector.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Keywords has been helped by the growing popularity of computer games

""He had been asking me for a number of years, he thought I could really grow and make something of the business,"" says Andrew. ""At the time it was just 50 people in an office in Dublin.""

Andrew was born and raised in South Africa. He and his family moved to the UK when he was 16, settling close to London. After gaining a management degree from Bradford University, he then had a varied career in business.

He started working for cigarette firm Rothmans, before moving into mergers and acquisitions in a number of industries, and then finally specialising in the technology sphere.

Andrew's plan for Keywords was big expansion, helped by using his knowledge of organising takeovers to buy firms, which would allow the business to expand the services it could offer gaming companies. His joining the business also happily coincided with the huge growth in popularity of computer games over the last decade.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Andrew hopes that Keywords will become a €1bn business

To accelerate its growth and acquisitions, in 2013 Andrew floated Keywords on the London Stock Exchange's AIM market, which raised some £30m.

""It has been a rare example of spotting an opportunity, having that vision, then creating a business plan and following it religiously,"" says Andrew.

Technology sector analyst Patrick O'Donnell of Irish stockbrokerage Goodbody, says, ""Andrew Day has been critical for Keywords.

""Keywords has completed over 40 acquisitions under Andrew's leadership, and is now clients to 23 of the top 25 global video gaming publishers, and all top 10 mobile game developers,"" he says.

More The Boss features:

These companies all use Keywords because it is cheaper and more convenient for them to give it work to do it rather than employ vastly more staff in-house. ""We get projects to do,"" says Andrew. ""So if the gaming firms did this work in-house, at the end of a certain project they could have staff just sitting around.""

Andrew says that Keywords has no plans to ever release its own games, or as he puts it, ""bite the hands that feed it"". Instead he thinks the firm will grow to see annual sales of €1bn, such is the growing demand for its services, from a gaming industry with total revenues of more than $159bn (£127bn) per year.

He is, however, still wary of playing the games himself. ""I find it hard to put a game down. I want to complete it, to move to the next level. Or if I'm playing the same level over and over again I want to do it faster, or jump higher, or catch more coins. It appeals to my personality rather sadly.""",The gaming boss who gets addicted to the games,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-53248321,2020-07-10

A popular Hispanic-owned food company is facing calls for a boycott, after its chief executive praised US President Donald Trump.

While at the White House, Goya Foods CEO Robert Unanue said Mr Trump's leadership was a blessing.

Goya Foods - sold in the US and many Latin countries - is the largest Hispanic-owned food company in the US.

But now many of its loyal customers and some high-profile Democrats are calling for the firm's products to be shunned.

How did this start?

On Thursday, Robert Unanue, the CEO of Goya Foods, attended an event at the White House where President Trump signed the Hispanic Prosperity Initiative, which was described as an effort to improve access to educational and economic opportunities.

Mr Unanue praised the president at the event, saying: ""We're all truly blessed at the same time to have a leader like President Trump, who is a builder.""

Critics said his comments were tone deaf to the community Goya Foods largely serves.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Robert Unanue (left) has defended his comments and called the boycott calls ""suppression of speech""

During his first election campaign, Mr Trump depicted most Mexican immigrants as criminals. He has also pursued controversial anti-immigration policies, seeking to end a policy that protects hundreds of thousands of undocumented youths from deportation, and trying to build a southern border wall.

Many users have since said they will no longer use the products, known as staples of authentic Latin cuisine.

Boycotters have shared alternative brands and recipes online, with the hashtags #Goyaway and #BoycottGoya trending on social media.

Why is this a big deal?

Some customers say they have grown up with a sense of cultural attachment to the brand, but now feel let down by the CEO's comments.

""Goya is such a staple amongst people of colour,"" longtime supporter Autasia Ramos told the BBC, adding that it was popular with both American and immigrant households.

Ms Ramos said she had relied on the company for affordable products that are normally hard to find, but are key ingredients in Hispanic cuisines.

Yet, she added, she now felt ""disheartened"" by the company, and planned to stop buying its products.

""I hope people choose not to support so the CEO really feels the effect of abandoning the community that supports his company.""

Image copyright Goya Foods Image caption Goya Foods is the largest Hispanic-owned food company in the US

Celebrities such as Chrissy Teigen and Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez also say they have decided to boycott the company.

Ms Ocasio-Cortez, a New York lawmaker, tweeted that she would now learn how to make her own Adobo, a popular marinade in Hispanic cuisine, rather than buying it from Goya Foods.

Former Democratic presidential candidate Julián Castro said Americans should ""think twice before buying their products"" given that their CEO had praised ""a president who villainises and maliciously attacks Latinos for political gain"".

How has the company responded?

Mr Unanue has defended himself, and pointed out he has also worked with former US First Lady Michelle Obama on initiatives before.

""It's suppression of speech,"" he said. ""I'm not apologising for saying - and especially when you're called by the president of the United States - you're gonna say, 'no, I'm sorry I'm busy no thank you?'""

""I didn't say that to the Obamas and I didn't say that to President Trump.""

Supporters of the company have pointed out that earlier this year, Goya donated over 300,000lb (136,077kg) of food, or about 270,000 meals, to food banks and organisations to help with coronavirus relief.

At Thursday's event, Mr Unanue announced he would also donate one million cans of Goya chickpeas and 1m lb of food products to food banks to help families hurt by the pandemic.

The president's son, Donald Trump Jr, condemned the backlash, tweeting ""the leftist mob wants to cancel one of the largest Hispanic owned companies in America because they recognise that the president has shown great leadership? (Not very woke)"".

Why the Latino vote is so important

By Luis Fajardo, BBC Mundo, Miami

Given the history of controversial statements by Donald Trump about Latinos, starting with his description of Mexican immigrants as ""rapists"", many will have been surprised by the praise he received from Goya Foods head Robert Unanue.

In fact, Mr Unanue's endorsement of Mr Trump, and the subsequent condemnation of the businessman's stance by many prominent Latinos, only underline the fact that the Hispanic community in the United States is politically far from monolithic.

Although a clear majority of Latinos in the US tend to vote Democrat, 28% of their ballots went for Mr Trump in 2016, according to the Pew Research Center.

Particularly in Florida, many Cuban and Venezuelan-Americans like Mr Trump's strong words against the leftist governments in power in Havana and Caracas, which they blame for forcing their families into exile.

With elections in battlefield states often defined by razor-thin margins, even a small defection of Latinos to the Republican camp could prove very valuable to the president.",Goya Foods: Hispanic brand faces boycott for praising Trump,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-53371392,2020-07-10
Katy Watson,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Despite political divisions and an economic crisis Argentina has kept cases comparatively low

South America is the new epicentre of the global coronavirus pandemic, but the region's leaders have responded to the crisis very differently.

A great deal has been said about poverty in this part of the world, like the favelas in Brazil where social distancing is hard to achieve and where basic sanitation is not always a given.

There is also the fact that there are so many millions of unregistered workers who rely on earning money every day to put food on the table for their families.

The impossible choice that many people have told me they face is to risk starving or risk getting Covid-19.

There are, undoubtedly, massive challenges in this, one of the most unequal parts of the world. But, say many experts, politics is just as important as poverty.

""I always defended - as many of us in public health did - the importance of having strong, structured health systems,"" says Deisy Ventura, professor of Global Health Ethics at the University of Sao Paulo.

""But if there's one thing I have learned from the pandemic it's the importance of politics - for good and bad.""

Unity in Argentina

Professor Ventura singles out Argentina. Leading a country already deep in economic crisis, President Alberto Fernandez, who has been in power for less than a year, locked down swiftly when the virus hit.

The country has registered just over 90,000 cases and 1,720 people have died.

""It's an extremely divided country, it's been through a very intense political crisis but those adversaries were able to sit around the table and come to an agreement over the necessities of quarantine measures,"" says Professor Ventura.

""They have press conferences with various politicians from different political stripes and they announce things together - so the population understand what needs to be done.""

Uruguay and Paraguay have also been singled out as examples. They have fewer than 100 deaths between them, even though they both share borders with badly hit Brazil.

But they are the exceptions.

'Pandemonium' in Brazil?

""Unfortunately in some Latin American countries - Brazil especially - the issue of measures has become partisan and that is absurd,"" says Professor Ventura.

Its President, Jair Bolsonaro, is a man who has made light of the virus from the very start.

He's called it the sniffles and seldom paid tribute to the nearly 70,000 people who have died. He has disagreed with his own health ministry over the importance of social distancing, he has argued with state governors who introduced quarantine measures and he has pushed to re-open the economy at the earliest opportunity.

Now he has the virus himself, he's taking the opportunity to promote the unproven anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine as a valid treatment.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Brazil's president played down the pandemic before contracting coronavirus

This confused political messaging doesn't help.

""Brazil is the only country dealing with a pandemonium and a pandemic at the same time,"" says Miguel Nicolelis, a neuroscientist who is helping north-eastern states tackle Covid-19.

""Nowhere that you can look in the world you can see a political upheaval at the same time you are trying to fight the coronavirus. The response of the federal government has been the worst you could imagine.""

Communication is key during an emergency, says Professor Ventura.

""People learn very quickly when they are exposed to a risk. They need to understand the risk, communication needs to be efficient and they need to trust authorities.""

Image copyright AFP Image caption Brazil has seen the most Covid-19 deaths in the region

But that lack of trust is echoed across the region.

A 'missed opportunity' for Chile?

Mati Libuy Rios is a doctor in Maipu, one of the worst-hit parts of Chile's capital Santiago. A relatively rich country in South America, Chile has seen a sharp rise in cases and deaths in recent weeks. More than 300,000 registered infections and nearly 7,000 confirmed deaths.

Mati has been working flat out in recent months - on one recent shift, he had to tell 10 families that their loved ones were dying.

""It's really hard - I am 30 years old, this will probably be the most challenging experience of my life as a physician. Nobody prepares you for this situation.""

There is tension in Chile over lockdown - and the pandemic hit just months after widespread protests last year over social and economic inequalities.

Mati thinks the government failed to step up to the task of dealing with the pandemic early on.

""We have massive health inequalities, people need to work to get food every day, it's as simple as that,"" he says.

""The government needed to give people all the material conditions to stay at home and at the same time increase testing, isolate contagious people and track all the possible contacts. It's the simplest way to control it and they missed the opportunity.""

But nothing compares to the numbers in Brazil - a country where many feel the pandemic is nothing but political.

""Every country that took this lightly - that initially made a joke about it - paid a huge price,"" says Miguel Nicolelis.

""When politicians challenge biology, biology wins by a huge margin. Sorry and sad to say as a Brazilian but it's the reality. We didn't prepare, take it seriously and we now see exponential curves exploding.

Disease detectives are trying desperately to beat the clock and find those who have been exposed to the virus. Can they move fast enough to stop the pandemic?

As a public-health director in Savannah, Georgia, Cristina Pasa Gibson spent her time in an office filled with calorie counters and yoga mats and the scent of jasmine tea. Then she started working on contact tracing, a no-holds-barred effort to stop the pandemic, and her office and her life were turned upside down. ""I felt like I was in a Vegas casino,"" she says. ""I didn't know what time it was, what day it was, who I was.""

She and her colleagues in Savannah and her counterparts in other cities across the country have been working frantically to trace the path of the infection and to find those who may have been exposed to the virus. They talk to patients, asking for names of individuals they have spent time with, and chase down those individuals and to tell them to remain isolated so they do not infect others.

The pressure on investigators and contact tracers has been intense. ""I basically lived in my office,"" says Gibson, describing the early days. ""It was Groundhog Day over and over.""

Today their role is even more important. The US now has the highest number of cases and deaths in the world.

Red State, Blue State

Gibson is grappling with the pandemic, and she and her colleagues are trying to use contact tracing as a way to contain the virus. Her counterparts in New Haven, Connecticut, a city that lies almost 900 miles to the north, are also working feverishly to track the disease. Yale University student Tyler Shelby, 26, the son of a Kansas police detective and a fan of the fictional detective Sherlock Holmes (played by Benedict Cumberbatch in a BBC version), helped to organise an investigative squad and coordinates dozens of volunteers.

Cristina Pasa Gibson of Savannah and Tyler Shelby of New Haven are struggling with life-or-death matters in a country where people are deeply divided in their views of the pandemic and how the government should manage the health crisis.

The number of cases has shot up in Georgia, Florida, Texas and other states where governors tried to reinforce Trump's message about the nation's economic comeback. Meanwhile the number of cases in Connecticut, New York and other northern states, places initially hit hard by the virus, has gone down.

The contact-tracing initiatives in New Haven and Savannah are far from perfect. But they have been recognised by experts in the field as programmes that were started early and run with vigour. Taken together, these two programmes offer a snapshot of the high-stakes drama of contact tracing and show how the system is being put in place in both the northern and the southern parts of the country.

Uncovering secret lives

Gibson spoke recently on the phone in her Savannah office with someone who had tested positive: ""He asked me: 'Am I going to die?' That's a terrible question to be faced with because so much is unknown. I could not give that person a definite answer."" Talking to people on the phone when they are scared and anxious is hard. In addition, the people who work in contact tracing have to find out key information from those who have gotten sick.

Image caption Cristina Pasa Gibson, shown at her parents' house in Gainesville, Virginia, beats drumsticks in a workout class to reduce pandemic stress

Investigators and contact tracers try to find out whom the patients spoke to during a two-day period before they became ill and for the period of time beyond that - until they isolated themselves from others. That means recalling anyone they saw for more than 15 minutes and who stood or sat within six feet of them. Did you see a movie, take an Uber or go to church? If so - did you stop for donuts? an investigator may ask, according to a government report on contact-tracing programmes.

The challenges are immense: ""You're asking people to think back,"" says Yale student Tyler Shelby. This raises the possibility for potentially awkward conversations: ""You don't necessarily need to specify who they slept with. It's really just anybody that meets that criteria"", or the guidelines that define close contact as anyone within six feet of you.

The conversations with a patient on the phone can be tough, with long silences. ""Definitely people can have hesitation,"" Shelby says.

""My first call - I was really nervous,"" says Yale student Paulina Luna Martinez, who is 27. She soon found it easy to speak with the people, though, and spends about a half-hour with each: ""They talk about their lives."" She and the other volunteers send back the lists of contacts they have compiled, and a separate group of people tracks down the individuals on these lists, men and women who have been exposed to the virus.

One of the most important aspects of contact tracing is helping those who are struggling. People who test positive need to stay separated from others, but they may need help. Those who have been exposed to the virus but remain healthy may not have enough money to see them through two weeks of isolation.

As Columbia University's Patrick Kachur, explains, offering help to those who are sick and trying to protect others from the virus is one of the most important aspects of contact tracing. ""People think: 'This has to work because this is a key to getting back our lives,"" he says. ""But it's more than just counting cases and closing investigations. It's putting people in touch with the services they need.""

Image copyright Courtesy of family Image caption ""My first call - I was really nervous."" says Paulina Luna Martinez, shown above on the left, with housemate Elsie Gonzalez in New Haven

In New Haven and Savannah, the investigators and contact tracers help people contact officials with social-service agencies if they need a place to stay during quarantine or would like someone to deliver groceries. In Nevada, says Adriane Casalotti, a spokeswoman for the National Association of County and City Health Officials, they feed their horses.

Running against the clock

Contact tracing has a long history - the system was used to stop the spread of syphilis in the US in the 1930s. More recently, tracers ferreted out cases of Ebola in West Africa and other countries and helped beat back the disease. Yet contact tracing has never been used on a virus as ferocious as Covid-19, on such a broad scale, and these factors have helped to expose shortcomings in the tracing system.

In England, the inefficiencies of the NHS Test and Trace, as the contact tracing programme is known, have been exposed by the BBC and other media.

Analysts at the Center for Health Security say that the cost of the contact tracing, if done properly across the nation, would be steep: $3.6b USD. Yet only some of the resources are available. According to NPR, about 37,000 tracers have so far been assigned to the task

New Haven and Savannah are both about the same size. New Haven has a population of about 130,000, and Savannah has a population of 145,000. But Cristina Pasa Gibson and Tyler Shelby and others who live in these two cities have experienced the pandemic in different ways.

Image copyright Courtesy of Mark Abraham Image caption DataHaven's Mark Abraham, right, with his son in New Haven during a stay-at-home order, maps areas where the virus has struck

New Haven, a city once known for its manufacturing industry and now for its university, Yale, is close to the New York epicentre. For many New Yorkers, New Haven is the end of the line, the place where they step off the train. In April, New Haven officials were reporting 20-35 new cases each week per 10,000 people, according to DataHaven, a nonprofit organisation, a spike that was caused partly by people from New York. By late June, more than 1,070 people had died of the disease in New Haven and the surrounding county.

Savannah is a port city far from the coronavirus hotspots. In April, while Cristina Pasa Gibson and her colleagues were organising their team, they had fewer cases to manage. Officials in Savannah and the surrounding Chatham County reported only one or two new cases each week per 10,000 people, according to DataHaven. By late June, 37 people in Chatham County had died.

The number of cases in New Haven started to drop in the springtime. Slowly, though, cases in Savannah and Chatham County began to climb. The explanation for the disparity in infection rates between New Haven and Savannah are varied and complex. Geography plays a role, but so do decisions made by political leaders.

The Republican governor of Georgia and the leaders of other states in the southern part of the country rushed to restart their economies. The Democratic governor of Connecticut and leaders of other northern states waited.

New Haven embodies the northern model - investigators and tracers were quickly deployed in large numbers (more than 150 were put in rotation, and they have since merged with a statewide group of several hundred). Savannah reflects the southern model of contact tracing and review of cases: their 49-member team is leaner.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Activists in Texas protest against contact tracing programmes

Albert Ko, a professor of epidemiology at Yale School of Public Health who serves on a state board, the Reopen Connecticut Advisory Group, says the New Haven team is doing an above-average job. Experts have also praised the efforts in Savannah.

In both cities, though, investigators are struggling to contact people fast enough. They are floundering in other ways too. The Savannah team members often find themselves without a Spanish speaker and rely on a Spanish-language phone line. In New Haven, they only managed to conduct interviews with 64% of the individuals they tried to contact, according to an epidemiologist with the New Haven health department.

Investigators and tracers should be able to contact 90% of patients within a day of hearing that they have the virus, according to the industry standard.

Still, says Patrick Kachur, a Columbia University professor who used to work for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a programme like the one in New Haven has value. ""It's two-thirds of the way to 90%,"" Kachur says. ""Even if it can't be done perfectly, it's still worth doing.""

Looking for clues

Last winter Tyler Shelby, who is studying for both a Yale medical degree and a public-health doctorate, was working at a cubicle decorated with potted vines and getting ready to go to Uganda on a Fulbright scholarship. Then he started seeing news about Covid-19 on Reddit. ""I thought: I'm needed right here,"" he says. He began working with his colleagues on a contact-tracing programme. Soon the number of cases shot up.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Public-health experts say 180,000 more people are needed for contact tracing, and US national guard members are being trained

Shelby and others on his team dug in and became specialists in US-based ""shoe-leather epidemiology"", as a Vermont health official, Daniel Daltry, puts it. Their heroes are amateur sleuths on true-crime podcasts and legendary figures such as Watson, the sidekick to the fictional detective Sherlock Holmes. Watson could always ""go with the flow"", says Shelby: ""He puts up with Holmes, but he's observant himself.""

The disease detectives are a diverse lot: working with Shelby, Yale medical student Paulina Luna Martinez began calling patients from her group house in New Haven. Maritza Bond, the city's public-health director, studied a heat map of her old neighbourhood, Fair Haven, an area filled with Puerto Rican families that became a Covid hot spot, and epidemiologist Brian Weeks tracked data (""I like to make sense of things,"" he says).

Savannah epidemiologist Meredith Avery started working in a small-town pharmacy at 16, and Cristina Pasa Gibson used to take care of laboratory monkeys. The successes or failures of the disease detectives in the two cities hold lessons for those around the world.

During her morning commute from Statesboro, a town that is about an hour's drive from Savannah, Avery listens to Crime Junkie. She has a keen interest in investigations, both criminal and epidemiological, and says that she felt uneasy in the early days of the pandemic and a bit excited too. ""You learn about these things in school,"" says 30-year-old Avery. ""And you think it's never going to happen here.""

Contact tracers in Singapore used CCTV footage to track down people who were exposed to the virus. South Korean authorities constructed ""virtual nets"" around individuals to protect others from the virus, according to the Hill.

But most people in the US baulk at contact-tracing apps, according to a Washington Post-University of Maryland poll, because of privacy concerns.

Thurmond Neill Tillman, a pastor at First African Baptist Church in Savannah, says he understands the need for contact tracing: three people in his congregation have become ill with the virus. But he is concerned about the system's invasive nature. ""I can see how it would be very troubling,"" he says. ""I probably would have hated it as a teenager.""

Empathy lessons

Detectives are good listeners. They try to win the trust of people, and the ability to put yourself in someone else's shoes is helpful. Cristina Pasa Gibson, 50, says she learned about cultural differences as a five-year-old while visiting her cousin in Manila. They came across an illustration of an egg basket in a colouring book, and her cousin painted one of the eggs dark, making it look like an egg soaked in slaked lime, a snack in the Philippines. ""I said: 'There's no such thing as a purple egg,' and I hit her,"" Gibson says. ""I was such a spoiled brat. That began my introspective journey.""

Outside Manila, Gibson saw families living in poverty, with ramshackle huts as homes, and decided in college to work in public health. The experience she had as a child have helped her in her work fighting the pandemic: she understands that not everyone sees the world in the same way, and they are fighting the virus in different ways too.

Disease detectives are now settling into their roles. Yet the future of the nation and the trajectory of the disease remains unclear. The president is planning to hold rallies this summer, and activists are continuing to protest against police brutality. These mass gatherings pose problems for investigators and contact tracers, who struggle to get in touch with people who have joined the gatherings and may be infected.

The people who are working on the contact-tracing programmes are honest about their limitations. ""From the beginning one of our mantras was: 'We'll do as much as we can for as long as we can,'"" says Yale student Tyler Shelby: ""Everything was unclear and nobody knew what was around the corner. We just accepted that uncertainty. We figured that we're not going to be able to resolve everything, but we're going to do what we can.""

In Savannah, Cristina Pasa Gibson has been calling people to tell them about their Covid-19 test results, a departure from the traditional purview of contact tracing but part of the larger fight against the pandemic. She jokes with her colleagues about setting up metal bells in the office so they can ding them whenever someone on the phone calls out: ""Thank you, Jesus.""

The person on the phone has escaped the virus, marking a victory for them and for the disease detectives too, and she wants to mark the occasion.",Coronavirus: Disease detectives track an invisible culprit,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-53244843,2020-07-10
Noele Illien,"A year ago in Switzerland, a Federal Supreme Court ruling about whether companies should help pay remote workers’ rent passed largely unnoticed.

In its decision on 23 April 2019, the nation’s highest court ruled that if an employee is required to work from home, the company must pay a share of the rent. In the case, the part-time employee didn’t have to rent a bigger apartment or incur other additional costs by working remotely, but was entitled to a monthly rent reimbursement of CHF150 ($157, £127) because the company was able to save on office rent.

“The employer has to compensate for the business use of your apartment, if you don’t have a suitable workplace,” explains Martin Müller, a partner and head of employment at Pestalozzi law firm in Switzerland. He compares it to companies reimbursing employees who use their personal car for business purposes. “The employee pays the car insurance, etc., but the law says the employer has to take over a share.”

Although the decision mostly flew under the radar, it’s found renewed relevance in light of Covid-19. With much of Switzerland’s labour force working from home during the pandemic, the ruling has sparked considerable debate. Does it mean that every employee now working from their kitchen table due to Covid-19 should expect to receive a subsidy?

‘Proportional to salary’

Not exactly, says Müller. The ruling does not automatically entitle everyone who works from home to compensation, he explains. A deciding factor is whether an employee has to work remotely or chooses to do so; if you could also work from the office then your rent would not be reimbursed.",The Swiss court ruling on home workers’ rent,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200707-the-swiss-court-ruling-on-home-workers-rent,2020-07-07
Analysis Jill Disis,"Hong Kong (CNN Business) Nations and companies around the world are being sucked into a running battle over the future of technology between the United States and China, forcing them to choose sides in a conflict that is fracturing global supply chains and pushing businesses out of lucrative markets.

The latest casualty is TikTok, a video app that is popular with teenagers and which has hundreds of millions of devoted fans across markets such as India and the United States. The app is owned by a Chinese company, but run by an American CEO

The first major hit came last month, when TikTok was blocked in India after a heated border clash with China left at least 20 Indian soldiers dead. Then, on Monday, US authorities said they would look at banning the app because they consider it a possible threat to national security. That news broke as the company said it would leave Hong Kong because of concerns over a sweeping national security law China imposed on the city.

""It is becoming harder to be a truly global tech platform,"" said Dipayan Ghosh, the co-director of the Digital Platforms and Democracy Project at the Harvard Kennedy School.

The fight right now between the world's two largest economies cuts to the heart of that issue. The United States and China are competing over artificial intelligence, super-fast 5G mobile networks and other technology. Although the countries have long-running economic ties that enable some collaboration, recent tensions over national security have pushed their governments and businesses to reconsider those partnerships.

The conflict is bleeding over into the relationships those countries have with other global powers, too. The United Kingdom, for example, is re-examining its decision to grant Chinese tech company Huawei the ability to help build the country's 5G network. That review comes after the United States, which has repeatedly targeted Huawei, imposed sanctions on the company that could prevent other firms from supplying it with the chipsets it needs to build its next-generation technology.

""My impression is that the tech companies are only now waking up to the fact that life in the future is going to be a lot less globalized,"" said Michael Witt, a senior affiliate professor of strategy and international business at INSEAD, the international business school. ""They are really on the horns of a dilemma.""

A bitter rivalry

IBM IBM Microsoft MSFT The United States and China have for decades held opposing views on how to wield technology. Whileandwere driving American innovation in the 1980s, China was laying down the foundation for its Great Firewall — a massive censorship mechanism that shuts out content widely available elsewhere on the internet. In the years since then, China has created a closed and controlled internet that has found fans among other authoritarian countries: Russia, for example, has moved to restructure and rein in its once freewheeling internet with the assistance of Chinese tech

The United States has responded by seeking to limit China's advance.

The Trump administration has accused China of stealing US technology, an issue central to the damaging trade war that has colored the relationship between the two since 2018. Chinese officials have repeatedly denied such allegations and argued that any tech secrets handed over were part of deals that had been mutually agreed upon. The United States has also imposed sanctions on prominent Chinese tech firms and taken steps to limit Beijing's access to America's vast capital markets

As Washington escalates its fight against Beijing, international technological cooperation looks increasingly likely to disappear.

""Beijing has concluded that decoupling is inevitable,"" wrote Ian Bremmer and Cliff Kupchan, the president and chairman of Eurasia Group, in a report published earlier this year that noted how Chinese President Xi Jinping is calling for the country to break its technological dependence on the United States.

""China will expand efforts to reshape international technology, trade, and financial architecture to better promote its interests in an increasingly bifurcated world,"" they wrote.

Huawei is a prime example of global tech tensions. Washington has for more than a year been pressuring its allies to keep the Chinese company's equipment out of their 5G networks.

The 'virtual Berlin Wall'

As the relationship between the world's two largest economies deteriorates, several analysts warned that the fallout will have major implications for every global power, along with the tech companies that operate across their borders.

The Eurasia Group analysts wrote that the ""new virtual Berlin Wall"" will push world economies to choose sides. They said traditional US allies such as Taiwan and South Korea, for example, may tilt toward China because they supply cutting-edge semiconductors that Chinese firms rely on to compete with global rivals.

""Both the US and China have demonstrated they're willing to weaponize global trade and supply chains,"" the analysts added.

Global tensions are also causing countries to view tech firms as ""national sectors, and not global actors,"" said Samm Sacks, a senior fellow at Yale Law School's Paul Tsai China Center who studies cybersecurity and US-China relations.

""It's the idea that a tech company is going into a market on the other side of the world, and now is being asked to carry the flag of the country,"" she added. ""This is a sea change from even a decade ago.""

Huawei has perhaps become the most prominent example of that shift.

Washington has for more than a year been pressuring its allies to keep the Chinese company's telecommunications equipment out of their 5G networks. That campaign may be producing some results in Europe: UK authorities said last week that US sanctions on the company will likely hurt Huawei's viability as a 5G network provider there, while Reuters reported Thursday that Italy's largest telecom firm is excluding the company from a bid for 5G equipment.

The advancement of technology in other parts of the world also suggests that there are ""evolving, multiple playbooks"" beyond the rivalry between the United States and China, according to Kislaya Prasad, a research professor at the University of Maryland's Robert H. Smith School of Business.

Retreat or decentralize

For the tech companies stuck trying to navigate this world, there are no easy options.

Witt, the INSEAD professor, said firms must choose between giving up on part of the world, or decentralizing their operations to such a point that the company is essentially two or more different entities.

TikTok seems to be trying the second approach. While the app is owned by Beijing-based ByteDance, it has taken great pains to distance itself from its parent company. In May, it hired former Disney executive Kevin Mayer as its CEO, and it has repeatedly said that its data centers are located entirely outside of China where that data is not subject to Chinese law.

The company might be trying to make an even more dramatic break. The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday , citing a source familiar with the matter, that ByteDance is considering establishing a headquarters for the video app outside of China or a new management board to distance the service from the country. A TikTok spokesperson confirmed to CNN Business that its parent company is weighing changes to its corporate structure.

""The close connection to the Chinese government is what has shut Huawei out of so many markets,"" said Ghosh, of the Harvard Kennedy School. (Huawei maintains that it is a private firm owned by its employees.)

""I think TikTok sees that and wants to distinguish itself from Huawei,"" he added.

But that might not be enough. US lawmakers have repeatedly piled on TikTok in recent weeks. And while the company says it doesn't pose any threats to national security, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo mentioned those concerns this week when he floated the idea of banning the app

""The problem is, I think, for them it's too late,"" Witt said. ""That light of public attention, that is already brightly shining on them. I think that's not going to end well for them.""

Julia Hollingsworth,"(CNN) In two months, 19-year-old Tianyu Fang is due to start his first semester at one of the most prestigious schools in America: Stanford University in California. Now, the Chinese national isn't sure if he'll make it.

Fang is one of the million or so international students who could be made to leave the United States if their universities switch to online-only learning, under a rule announced by Washington on Monday . Those who don't leave voluntarily face deportation.

Some universities have announced they will deliver all courses online due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has infected more than 2.9 million people and killed more than 130,000 in the US alone . Other universities are still planning to run classes on campus, but with the US outbreak still not under control, there's a risk that those institutions could go remote, too.

More than half of international students in the US come from Asia. In the 2018-2019 academic year, 370,000 students were from China, 202,000 from India, and 52,000 from South Korea.

For Fang, who has studied in the US since middle school but returned to Beijing earlier this year, Monday's announcement exacerbates an already complicated situation. To get around the US ban on travelers who have been in China in the past two weeks, he planned to fly from China to Cambodia. After 14 days, he would hopefully fly to the US.

Now, things are even harder. Currently, Stanford plans to stagger which students are on campus each semester to maintain social distancing. First year students will be on campus in the fall and summer terms -- meaning Fang will be studying remotely in one semester and will have to leave the US for that period.

Even that will be challenging. There are few flights between the US and China, where international arrivals have to quarantine for two weeks.

Now, Fang is weighing up whether he wants to pay about $60,000 a year to study remotely from China. If he does, he won't have all the unplanned interactions and conversations that usually come with a school experience.

Living with uncertainty

For now, 29-year-old Chinese national Chen Na isn't affected by Monday's changes.

At New York University (NYU), where Chen is halfway through a two-year master's degree, her courses will be a combination of online and offline when fall semester starts.

But there's a chance that NYU could go back to online-only classes, as it did in March.

""I can't stop thinking about it,"" she said. ""I just feel kind of powerless and vulnerable. I will try my best to stay here legally.""

If courses go online-only, transferring to another university won't be an option -- few other schools offer the Interactive Telecommunications Program Chen is studying.

Instead, she would have to try to go back to China, which would be expensive.

When Chen first heard the rule change, she felt desensitized as there have been a number of other policies that make things more difficult for international students.

In May, for instance, New York Times and Reuters reported that the US was planning to cancel the visas of thousands of Chinese graduate students and researchers with ties to universities affiliated with the People's Liberation Army. In April, Republican Senator Tom Cotton suggested Chinese students at US universities shouldn't be allowed to study science and technology. The Trump administration has also made a litany of changes to the US immigration system , citing the coronavirus pandemic, which have resulted in barring swaths of immigrants from coming to the country.

""We don't have much power here, and then sometimes we become the sacrifice for all these political games,"" Chen said. ""I'm really aware of my foreign status here, I know I'm a foreigner. I don't necessarily see an increasing hostility from other people, but I do feel like policy-wise, it's crushing us.""

The difficulty in getting home

It may be harder for some students to get home than others.

Theresa Cardinal Brown, director of immigration and cross-border policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center, says some student might not be able to home might at all.

""The bigger issue is some of these countries have travel restrictions on and they can't go home, so what do they do then?"" she added. ""It's a conundrum for a lot of students.""

India, the US' second-biggest source of international students, has closed its borders to commercial flights, although it is still running repatriation flights

Maitri Parsana, who has just finished her third year of biological sciences at the University of Buffalo in New York state, doesn't know how she would get back to India if she was forced to leave.

Maitri Parsana in the United States, where she has studied at the University of Buffalo for three years.

Her university has said it will offer hybrid courses, but the 22-year-old fromo Gujarat state, still doesn't know whether her specific classes will be online or offline.

Parsana says there are no flights to India, but she hopes her government would arrange flights to get stranded students back home.

""I am definitely scared, I really don't know what to do. I was already stressed about my school and now i have to stress about one more thing,"" she said, adding that the US appears to be focusing on international students rather than addressing real problems, such as the pandemic.

""We just feel like we're being pushed away from this country for no reason.""

Business impacts

It's not just students who may be hurt by Monday's decision. It could impact the US economy, too.

In 2018, students from China, India and South Korea alone contributed more than $25 billion to the economy, according to non-profit Institute of International Education.

If students are forced to leave the country, they may not be willing to continue paying tuition fees to study remotely from a different time zone.

Nicholas Henderson, the co-founder and director of Essai Education, a Delhi based test-prep and counseling institute for Indian students wanting to study in the US, said that the regulations may prompt colleges to change their policies to hybrid models, for instance, to help people stay.

""I think what Covid has shown is that universities are willing to work with the students,"" he said.

But even so, there's the risk that the US' policies may discourage future students from choosing to study in the US.

When Parsana first came to the US, she planned to try to settle there. Now, she says she doesn't want to live in the US, and would encourage students looking to study abroad to consider another country, like Australia or Canada.

""I don't know what (the US government is) trying to do because their economy is going to go to ashes if they do this,"" Parsana said. ""If they keep on doing these kinds of rules, not a lot of people are going to come here for their education.""

Career impacts

If international students are sent home early, it's not just their education that will be impacted. Students could end up missing out on job opportunities -- often one of the reasons they might have chosen to study in the US in the first place.

In the US, international students qualify for a scheme that allows them to work in the country after they graduate.

A 24-year-old South Korean university student says he feels ""disappointed"" that, due to Monday's policy change, he may miss out on that scheme. CNN agreed not to use his real name because of his concerns for privacy.

He only has one semester of his degree to go, and when he signed up for his courses, they were all offline. Now, they have changed to online courses, and it seems like he will either have to go home or transfer to another university for his final semester.

""I have no idea what's going on,"" he said. ""I just renewed my house contract.""

If he goes home, he won't qualify for the temporary employment scheme -- and if he wants to work in the US, he'll likely need to find a company to sponsor his visa.

""I'm so frustrated,"" he said. ""I just want to get some opportunities at least to compete.""

Chen is faced with a similar situation. Before the pandemic, she planned to stay in the US and find a job after graduating in 2021. But now, Chen is weighing up whether the US is the best place to be, after all.

""I wonder if it's really worth it to go through all of this ... instead of finding a country that values me more,"" she said.",One million foreign students risk being frozen out of US colleges.

Analysis Laura He,"Hong Kong (CNN Business) Last month's deadly border battle between India and China has already begun to affect business and technology. But the world's two most populous countries have a lot to lose should the dispute escalate into a full-on trade war.

New Delhi has indicated that it is willing to exert economic pressure on its neighbor. Trade organizations in the country reported last week that Chinese shipments were suddenly being held up at Indian checkpoints, while authorities in one state paused hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Chinese business deals. And earlier this week India took the dramatic step of banning dozens of mobile apps, including well-known Chinese ones like ByteDance's TikTok,WeChat, and social media network

The backlash has reached the highest political levels: Weibo said this week that it had removed Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's account at the Indian government's request.

Beijing's response so far has been cautious. Chinese officials said Tuesday that they were ""strongly concerned"" about the app ban, for example, but they did not threaten any kind of retaliation. And on Friday, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stressed that the two countries should work together, adding that barriers to cooperation ""will harm India's interests."" Some Chinese state media have called for ""cooler"" heads to prevail.

""As of now, China is only assessing the situation,"" said Geethanjali Nataraj, an economics professor at the Indian Institute of Public Administration (IIPA). A ""trade war is not going to benefit either of the countries,"" she added.

China's tough line

China has plenty of leverage, if it chooses to retaliate for India's app ban.

It has long been a critical trade partner for India. From April 2019 to March 2020, India bought $65 billion worth of goods from China, accounting for nearly 14% of its total imports, according to Indian government data. Meanwhile, China bought $16.6 billion worth of goods from India. China was India's second largest trading partner for that period behind the United States, though that value of trade does not include Hong Kong.

India accounts for a much smaller share of China's total trade. Exports to India comprised only 3% of China's total in 2019, according to Chinese government statistics. And India was only China's 12th biggest trade partner last year.

But analysts who spoke to CNN Business stressed that any kind of warfare, economic or otherwise, with an Asian neighbor would be costly for Beijing. The world's second largest economy is already managing pressures on several fronts, including a Western backlash over a new, controversial security law for Hong Kong and its handling of the coronavirus pandemic. China is also managing its own economic struggles, including a historic first-quarter contraction and rising unemployment.

""China is holding a tough line on the territorial dispute with India, but it doesn't want to see a confrontation,"" according to Deng Yuwen, a researcher at the US-based think tank China Strategic Analysis Center, who detailed his thoughts in a video posted online last month.

Nataraj of the IIPA pointed out that China also likely doesn't want to jeopardize its trading relationship with India, either, given the fact that the country still sends tens of billions of dollars of goods to India each year.

""Chinese companies are already facing trade restrictions from [the United States] and other countries, and they are faced with over capacity,"" she said. ""Therefore, it is not easy for China to ignore a big market like India.""

Even so, there are political considerations at play for Beijing. Deng said that China can't be too ""soft"" on territorial disputes, or else it could risk angering the public.

""The Chinese public doesn't think China should give in to India,"" Deng added. ""In the people's perspective, China and India are like two boxers of different weight classes. It shouldn't be hard for the heavyweight to defeat the lightweight."" (India does, however, have significant experience with ground combat and air forces, and recent studies suggest the country maintains an edge in high-altitude mountainous environments, such as the one where the 2020 face-off is taking place.)

India's dilemma

India, meanwhile, is likely to ""lose more"" from engaging in a trade war with China, according to Nataraj.

Like many other countries, Asia's third-largest economy has been hit hard by the pandemic and the lockdown measures it imposed to prevent the virus from spreading. Industrial production shrank dramatically this spring, while the services industry collapsed. Business activity was still struggling through June , according to data about the services sector released Friday.

Nataraj said that many industries in India — including electronics, pharmaceuticals and IT hardware — are heavily dependent on imports, particularly from China.

Shipping and delivery companies have confirmed that the dispute is already causing disruption. DHL Express India told CNN Business on Friday that it is ""temporarily suspending pick up of import shipments from mainland China, Hong Kong and Macao due to recent delays in customs clearance of shipments into India."" And FedEx said that it is ""currently facing backlogs beyond our control, leading to congestion at our facilities.""

""Though there is nothing wrong in [being] vocal for local [business], the immediate short term anti-China momentum would affect the supply chain of Indian production networks,"" Nataraj said, adding that arbitrary import restrictions or consumer boycotts will be largely ""self-defeating.""

Potential retaliation

Even if both countries have reason to not engage in a trade war, analysts pointed out that raw emotions could push them toward escalation.

""There is a clear understanding in India that China could retaliate and that India is more dependent on Chinese products than the other way round, but the mood in India is one of acute resentment and anger,"" according to Kanti Bajpai, a professor at the National University of Singapore who studies Indian foreign policy and India-China relations. At least 20 Indian soldiers died during June's clash with Chinese troops in the Himalayas, according to the Indian army

""If the confrontation persists, Delhi may take economic actions on trade as well,"" Bajpai added.

In retaliation, Beijing could ""slow walk"" some of the market access it has promised India in areas such as pharmaceuticals and agriculture, according to Rick Rossow, the Wadhwani Chair in US-India Policy Studies at the Washington-based Center for Strategies and International Studies.

China could also pull back on new investments it was looking to make in India, he said.

Investment from China has poured into Indian startups and manufacturing but it was already becoming a point of contention. In April, the Indian government announced that foreign direct investment from countries that share a land border with India would be subject to more scrutiny.

""The economic consequences of these moves are likely to be modest initially, but the bigger impact could come if India decides to break away from China and secure stronger strategic ties with countries such as the United States, Japan, Australia and France,"" Rossow added.

Rhea Mogul,"(CNN) ""Imagine a world within a world."" That is how Hormuz Bana describes the centuries-old community where he lives in Mumbai -- and which is in danger of vanishing.

Located below the Eastern Express Highway, this storied enclave is everything that most of Mumbai is not: idyllic, languid, and devoid of the city's signature traffic.

""Living here has given me a sense of belonging,"" says the 30-year-old marketing executive.

Bana lives in Dadar Parsi Colony, one of 25 colonies in Mumbai that officials designed solely for Parsis, an ethnoreligious group of Persian descendants in India who follow the Zoroastrian religion.

The Zoroastrians, whose doctrines influenced the principles of Judaism and Christianity, fled from Persia -- modern-day Iran -- to India in the 7th century to avoid political and religious persecution. Over centuries, a thriving community of bankers, industrialists, traders and engineers grew along India's west coast.

A Parsi temple in Mumbai on March 12, 2012.

But their numbers are dwindling. According to Indian Census data , there were more than 100,000 Parsis in the country in 1941. By 2011, there were fewer than 60,000. And by 2050, experts predict numbers will drop to about 40,000.

As numbers dwindle and the community fights to sustain itself, progressives want to widen the remit for new members. But they face strong resistance from more orthodox Parsis, who believe any dilution of their faith is sacrilegious.

Inside the enclave

Dadar Parsi Colony was established in the mid-1890s after the bubonic plague tore through Bombay, as Mumbai was then known, claiming thousands of lives.

At the time, the city was home to about 800,000 people, and the illness quickly spread through crowded slums. To ease congestion, the city's British colonial leaders expanded Bombay's limits to Dadar, then a low-lying marshland.

Visionary engineer Mancherji Edulji Joshi persuaded British authorities to set aside plots for lower middle-class Parsis, and drew up a blueprint of a model neighborhood, detailed to the type of flowers and trees to be planted on the streets. Joshi was given a 999-year lease for 103 plots.

Khorshed Villa, one of the oldest buildings in Dadar Parsi Colony.

In Dadar, the colony's leafy streets were laid out in a grid formation, lined by low-rise Victorian apartment blocks.

""He had a rule that no building should be more than two stories high,"" says Joshi's granddaughter, Zarine Engineer. ""Before a single house was constructed, he planted the streets with trees, each street with a different kind.""

Jam-e-Jamshed Road -- named after the prominent Parsi newspaper -- still has rows of ashoka trees. Firdausi Road, named after the Persian poet Firdawsi, is dappled with mahogany.

There is a library, a function hall, sports grounds, a seminary, a school, and a temple. The buildings are named after their proprietors: Dina House, Readymoney House and Marker House. It was not uncommon for Parsis' surnames to reflect their line of work.

The Readymoneys, for example, made their fortune by trading opium, which was a ready source of money. Another family, the Sodawaterbottleopenerwalas -- ""wala"" meaning ""of a place of trade"" -- most likely made a business of opening soda water bottles. It remains one of the best-known Parsi surnames and there's even an Indian chain of restaurants named after them.

Largest colony

Of all the Parsi colonies in Mumbai, Dadar Parsi Colony remains the largest. It is home to about 15,000 Parsis, roughly 12% of the community's global population.

Every morning, sometimes as early as 4:30 a.m., the colony's fitness enthusiasts power walk up and down the streets. Many of the older residents surface slightly later, perched on their verandas to pry on what's happening beneath them.

Soon, the fishmongers and vegetable sellers make their way to each apartment, selling their daily produce. The garbage collectors dutifully come to collect the garbage, and the launder does the same for clothes. There's an ironing man to collect and drop off ironed clothes, and the knife sharpener visits to sharpen knives.

But over the years, there have been attempts to thwart the community's traditional way of life. Engineer has, time and time again, fought off threats of encroachment on the colony by municipal corporations.

Ninety-year-old twins Mithoo and Mani Contractor, Joshi's cousins, have lived in the colony all their lives.

Joshi's granddaughter, Zarine Engineer, 75, another Dadar Parsi Colony local, sits on the same board of trustees that her grandfather did, the Parsi Central Association (PCA).

The PCA looks after the well being of the colony's residents -- although 99 years later, the PCA's methods have changed. Now, it has a WhatsApp group, in which members voice their complaints -- perhaps a broken street lamp or a pothole -- and Engineer will arrange for it to be fixed.

""When I was a young girl, I would sit beside (Joshi) as he patiently listened to the qualms of the residents,"" says Engineer. ""Some would complain of monkeys entering their house through windows, or a fallen tree, and today I am doing the same.""

The apartments are cheap -- and empty

Today, Mumbai's extreme wealth disparity has earned it the moniker of the world's ""most expensive slum.""

More than half of its residents live in slums with no running water, often just feet from some of the city's most expensive high-rises. The average rent for a two-bedroom apartment in the wider Dadar district costs an average Rs. 145,000 ($1,920) a month.

But rents inside all 25 of Mumbai's Parsi colonies have barely increased in decades. Long-time tenants continue to pay about Rs. 300 ($4) per month, and most are no longer perceived as lower-middle class.

Parsis are one of the most successful and wealthy minority groups in the world. They make up less than 1% of India's entire population, but four Parsis sit on the country's list of top 20 billionaires.

Apartments like the ones in the Parsi colonies -- spacious, well maintained and low in cost -- are hard to come by in Mumbai. Their interiors are a blend of British and Chinese influences, from Victorian motifs carved into oak bed frames to porcelain vases obtained through trade with mainland China.

Rents have remained low because of the Rent Control Act from 1947, which regulates the housing market in Mumbai and limits increase for residents who have been living in the same apartment prior to 1947, said Viraf Mehta, a trustee of the Bombay Parsi Punchayet (BPP).

The BPP owns most of the apartments in the Parsi colonies, including about 3,000 which fall under the act, as the same families have lived in those apartments for generations.

Mehta says the BPP rarely increases rents for newer residents ""out of benevolence.""

Colony apartments are highly sought after for their unique features and low price. Yet about a quarter of flats in the colonies remain empty, according to Mehta. Many of the occupants have settled overseas, but continue to pay the rent to ensure they don't lose the flat.

""The turnover rate is extremely low,"" says Mehta. ""We have close to 1,000 people on waiting lists wanting a flat in one of the colonies, but there are no vacant houses.""

Everyone on the waiting list is a Parsi.

Not open

Joshi couldn't afford to build a wall around the colony -- and, as a result, Dadar remains the only Parsi enclave without one. But the lack of a physical wall doesn't mean there aren't barriers to entry for those wishing to join the community.

After the BPP sold three plots to a developer some years ago , in 2009, that developer want to sell apartments on the plot to the highest bidder -- even if they were not Parsi.

The PCA eventually won a six-year battle against the developers, and a court granted a permanent injunction restraining the builder from selling flats inside the colony to anyone who was not a Zoroastrian.

Five years later, the Street Vendors' Act -- a nationwide bill aimed at improving the lives of street vendors -- would have paved the way for street stalls in Dardar colony. Led by Engineer, hundreds of people marched in protest to preserve the colony's heritage.

The plan was withdrawn and the colony's roads remain off limits.

Bana, an ordained Zoroastrian priest, lives in an apartment block built by his great-grandfather. His father grew up there, and his grandmother before that.

""To a layman, it would be very difficult to identify where the colony begins and ends,"" he says. ""But to us, we know each nook and cranny like the back of our hands.""

Declining population

Since the 1940s, the number of Parsis in India has plunged.

According to a study by demographer Ava Khullar, there are several reasons for to this phenomenon. Low fertility is one -- about a third of Parsis don't marry, and the average Parsi woman of child-bearing age has one child, compared to a national average of 2.5 children.

The exclusion of children born to women who marry non-Parsi men in the population figures is also a key reason.

The rule became legally binding following the Petit v Jijabhai case in 1908 . Suzanne Briere, a French woman and wife of the Parsi industrialist Ratanji Dadabhoy Tata, wished for her body to be left in Bombay's dokhmas, or Towers of Silence, to be exposed to vultures, per traditional Zoroastrian death rites.

After her marriage, she converted to Zoroastrianism by undergoing an initiation ritual performed by a priest. During the ceremony, individuals wear a sudreh (a sacred muslin tunic) and kusti (sacred thread) for the first time, while reciting prayers, completing their initiation into the faith.

Whether this conversion was permitted was up for dispute, as orthodox Parsis believed being born into the community was a prerequisite for initiation.

A child undertakes the Zoroastrian initiation ceremony in Mumbai in 1999.

Briere took her case to the Bombay High Court, where Justices Dinshaw Davar and Frank Beamon concluded that the Parsi community consists of Parsis who are born of both Zoroastrian parents who profess the Zoroastrian religion; Iranis from Persia professing the Zoroastrian religion; and the children of Parsi fathers by ""alien"" (non-Parsi) mothers who have been duly and properly admitted into the religion. The legal definition excludes the children of Parsi mothers by ""alien"" (non-Parsi) fathers.

Years later, the same rules are largely followed. Reformists argue it is sexist and bigoted, while others believe that it is the way things should be. ""I think it is our duty to ensure that we keep our race going,"" says Bana, who married a fellow Zoroastrian.

""I have no opinion on interfaith marriages. But personally, I think these are some things we can do to give back to a community when it has given us so much.""

Locked out of the colony

The BPP follows the same 1908 judgment made by Justices Davar and Beamon. If one spouse is non-Parsi, they are not deemed eligible for colony life.

""As far as the BPP is concerned, this is the law of the land,"" says Mehta. ""Whatever my personal beliefs are, I have a duty to uphold the trust deed which is bound by this.""

In 2019, Sanaya Dalal, a Parsi woman married to a half-Parsi man and resident of Dadar Parsi Colony, challenged these rules after her five-year-old son wasn't granted membership to the colony's gym for being ""a non-Parsi.""

""So I'm supposed to explain to my son that he'll have to bow out gracefully, leaving behind his friends and the playground that he loves so much,"" she wrote in an opinion piece

Dalal's case caused controversy within the community, with conservative members supporting the rule and progressive members deeming them anachronistic. After some debate, her son remains without membership, and is not allowed to enter the clubhouse unless signed in by a member.

Farzeen Khan, a 29-year-old Parsi woman who grew up in Khareghat Colony, sides with Dalal. ""The solution (to the falling numbers) is to be more inclusive,"" she says.

""We are one of the smallest but wealthiest communities in the country. I think it's time to open our doors and see how we can be more inclusive, rather than cling onto our exclusive identity from yesteryear,"" says Khan.

Despite their disagreements, Bana, the Zoroastrian priest, says Parsis will find a way to continue their legacy.

""We aren't a community that focuses on the negative,"" says Bana. ""I'm certain we will overcome any hurdle that comes our way, be it interfaith marriages, or extinction.""",One of India's richest minority groups enjoys some of Mumbai's best rents.

Sherisse Pham,"Fresh US sanctions have cut off the Chinese tech company's access to vital American technology to a greater extent than ever before. Countries and mobile network operators around the world are now questioning whether Huawei will be able to deliver on its 5G promises . And rising anti-China sentiment in India and elsewhere is not helping matters.

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared last month that ""the tide is turning against Huawei as citizens around the world are waking up to the danger of the Chinese Communist Party's surveillance state.""

Those remarks were ""a bit pre-emptive,"" said Carisa Nietsche, a researcher at the Center for a New American Security, a Washington think tank.

Pompeo lauded countries such as the Czech Republic, Poland and Estonia for ""only allowing trusted vendors in their 5G networks."" But Nietsche noted that many of those countries made up their minds last year, when they signaled they wouldn't work with Huawei . And European countries with much bigger economies, such as the United Kingdom, France and Germany, have yet to announce a total ban on Huawei.

But there is ""the beginning of a sea change in Europe,"" Nietsche said.

European countries and mobile carriers are now worried that Huawei won't be able to provide 5G infrastructure as promised given the ""massive hit to their business"" from the new US export controls, she said.

Huawei's 5G business in 'grave danger'

Huawei has been here before. Last year, the US government barred American firms from selling tech and supplies to the Shenzhen-based company without first obtaining a license to do so. Huawei stockpiled inventory and found alternative suppliers, and as a result, continued doing brisk business despite the US ban. The company's overseas smartphone sales took a hit , though, because it was forced to release new models that weren't able to access to popular Google apps.

Even after reporting a strong finish to 2019, however, Huawei warned that 2020 would be ""difficult.""

That would prove to be all too true.

Huawei's Shenzhen headquarters. Its 5G business is in danger, as the company battles a prolonged American campaign against its business.

than last year's ban. It applies to any global firms using American equipment to make semiconductors. The new rule restricts companies like TSMC, a Taiwan-based firm, from exporting computer chipsets and other key components to Huawei. The latest US sanction announced in May cuts much deeperthan last year's ban. It applies to any global firms using American equipment to make semiconductors. The new rule restricts companies like TSMC, a Taiwan-based firm, from exporting computer chipsets and other key components to Huawei.

Without those chipsets, Huawei can't build 5G base stations and other equipment, according to analysts at brokerage firm Jefferies.

""Based on the current direct export rule that the US put on, I really think that Huawei's 5G equipment business is in grave danger,"" Jefferies analyst Edison Lee said on a recent call with investors.

""If the law doesn't change, and if the US-China tension does not de-escalate, then I think there's a big risk that Huawei will stop being able to provide 5G equipment"" from early next year, he added.

Asked for comment for this story, Huawei spokeswoman Evita Cao said ""we continue to receive support from our customers,"" without going into further detail.

The company said in May that it ""categorically opposes"" the latest US sanction, calling the new rule ""discriminatory.""

""It will have a serious impact on a wide number of global industries"" and damage ""collaboration within the global semiconductor industry,"" Huawei said in a statement. ""We expect that our business will inevitably be affected,"" it added.

That may already be happening in the United Kingdom.

On Saturday, the UK-based Telegraph newspaper reported that Prime Minister Boris Johnson is poised to begin phasing out Huawei 5G tech in Britain ""as soon as this year,"" walking back a decision that granted Huawei a limited role in building that network.

Earlier last week, Oliver Dowden, the country's digital and media secretary, said that the US sanctions will ""likely have an impact on the viability of Huawei as a provider for the 5G network.""

""I am not a Sinophobe, I won't be drawn into Sinophobia,"" Johnson said on Tuesday. But ""I do want to see our critical national infrastructure properly protected from hostile state vendors, so we need to strike that balance.""

Huawei said earlier this year that it has secured 91 commercial 5G contracts, more than half (47) are in Europe, 27 are in Asia and 17 are elsewhere in the world.

China tensions

The United States has long viewed Huawei warily , suspicious of how closely the company is tied to the Chinese Communist Party. The company maintains that it is a private firm owned by thousands of its employees.

Critics also say Beijing could force Huawei to spy on other nations. Huawei says that has never happened and if it did, the company would refuse such orders.

Yet even as it claims independence from Beijing, Huawei has been caught up in sparring between China and the United States, and to an increasing degree, the European Union and countries such as India that are growing more wary of China.

The coronavirus pandemic has only strained relations further. Some countries, such as the United States , have blamed China for the outbreak, and others have been put off by what they see as Beijing's aggressive response to criticism.

There was a moment during the pandemic ""where China was able to assert itself on the global stage as a leader, and I think they fumbled that,"" especially in Europe, after China sent masks and respirators of dubious quality to countries experiencing outbreaks, said Nietsche.

There are now ""excellent signals"" coming from Germany and the United Kingdom ""that they will move to exclude or at least will take Huawei out of the core [5G] network,"" said Nietsche. Germany, for instance, is scrutinizing Huawei's data flows to see if the company is breaching European laws, she said.

India, meanwhile, had been going back and forth over whether to include Huawei equipment in the country's 5G network, said Chaitanya Giri, an analyst with Indian foreign policy think tank Gateway House. Huawei received the green light to participate in 5G trials late last year.

But tensions between New Delhi and Beijing have risen dramatically in recent weeks after at least 20 Indian soldiers were killed in border clashes with Chinese troops stationed in the Himalayas. China has also been singled out in India for blame over the coronavirus pandemic, according to Giri.

Some Indians have been calling for a boycott of Chinese goods. And in a move widely seen as retaliation against China, the Indian government last week banned TikTok and several other Chinese apps , saying they pose a ""threat to sovereignty and integrity.""

Huawei may now get caught up in the escalating tensions, according to Giri. Public sentiment has now ""consolidated, that we are not going to use any of the Chinese equipment,"" he said.

What Europe and India share, according to Giri, is a growing sense of unease following years of substantial investment by China.

""Big democracies right now are singing in a chorus,"" he said. ""They understand what's at stake.""",How much trouble is Huawei in?,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/04/tech/huawei-5g-india-europe-intl-hnk/index.html,2020-07-04

(CNN) While the United States has been wrecked by domestic crises for most of 2020, the rest of the world hasn't stopped turning. Instead, many global threats -- like North Korea -- have grown in breadth and depth while the administration has scrambled to belatedly battle the Covid-19 pandemic and to deal with domestic divisions and the outcry over police brutality and systemic racism. Concurrently, while President Donald Trump has been waging a war on his perceived political enemies, tensions between China and India , two nuclear armed powers, have escalated with fatal consequences.

These twin conflicts in Asia present serious challenges for US national security at a time when the President seems mostly focused on attacking his former national security advisor , John Bolton, and saying whatever he thinks will score him campaign support. That approach forebodes a continued lack of any semblance of a coherent, informed strategy when it comes to dealing with security issues in Asia.

For years, Trump has treated North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Un, like a key foreign policy surrogate. He has inaccurately pointed to his relationship with Kim and small concessions North Korea made, like releasing prisoner remains , as a sign that he's made progress on North Korean denuclearization. Now, Trump's preferred foreign policy surrogate may be his biggest liability.

While Kim has continued to develop his illegal nuclear program and other conventional capabilities at a quick pace, despite summiting with Trump and becoming his preferred pen pal, North Korea has recently upped the ante on direct threats to the US and our allies.

Verbal insults are flying out of Pyongyang, including from Kim Jong Un's sister, Kim Yo-jong, who accused the President of South Korea, Moon Jae-in, of ""pro-US flunkeyism."" This is a far cry from the inter-Korean warmth displayed at Moon's previous summits with Kim Jong Un. Escalation on the Korean peninsula, where the US has thousands of troops stationed with their families, is a reality now. And, if Trump's past is prologue, there's no certainty that he'll side with our ally, South Korea, if Kim continues his dangerous behavior on the peninsula.

It was clear that denuclearization was nothing more than a pipe dream long ago -- and Kim has more recently publicly vowed to increase North Korea's nuclear ""deterrent."" Kim's not denuclearizing and may be backtracking on demilitarizing. The risk of direct, physical confrontation on the Korean peninsula is more of a reality as is a direct North Korean attack on US democracy.

While North Korea's destabilizing actions have only increased in the last few months -- they are clearly aware that Trump is desperate to cling to Kim as he heads into the election, and they may be trying to pressure him into giving Kim concessions to maintain some semblance of ""success"" with North Korea.

They know Trump prioritizes his political agenda over policy priorities, and they may be trying to provoke him into giving them what they want -- sanctions relief -- in exchange for cooling it during his campaign.

While Trump's administration figures out how to respond to the chaos created by Kim -- not to mention ongoing bilateral tensions with China -- there has also been a direct physical altercation between India and China. At least 20 Indian soldiers were killed on Monday in the Galwan Valley -- an area controlled by China but claimed by both countries. India and China went to war over this strip of land in 1962 after which a tenuous status quo has existed.

This isn't the first time those tensions have escalated, but the casualties earlier this week mark the bloodiest episode in Sino-Indian relations in decades as both countries have accused each other of not respecting the line of actual control (LAC) which serves as a de facto border. Both sides have reportedly militarily reinforced their positions in the area despite attempts to de-escalate tensions. While the strip of land in question is small and relatively inhospitable, it does hold strategic importance to both countries.

Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, has proven himself willing to stand up to China's regional ambitions. He's been clear that he won't let India be bullied by China . Furthermore, both leaders have politics at play -- backing down from a nationalist agenda item could come with costs for them at home. While Indian and Chinese officials met Thursday to discuss escalation, there are calls in India for retribution against China

And, while officials on both sides battle it out verbally, something's got to give because, as we have seen, the use of force is totally on the table. An off ramp is urgently needed because both countries are probably looking for a way out. Not only are they still battling Covid-19 and facing economic uncertainties, but they need an off ramp that allows them to save face domestically. Doing that will require careful diplomatic calibration in terms of concessions for any loss of life and a coordinated de-escalation of military assets in the area.

While the State Department tries to deal with Chinese aggression on multiple fronts, they also have to contend with the fact that Trump will say or do whatever he thinks is most politically expedient. Trump even undercut Pompeo on trade issues with China by tweeting on Thursday and he's been all over the map on other China-related issues like Hong Kong, the Uighurs and more.

These twin crises in Asia mean that during these final months of Trump's term, his track record on foreign policy is resoundingly clear. The President has exposed the US to more risks from North Korea, not less, while also turning the country into the weakest link when it comes to trying to resolve global conflicts. We have Trump to thank for all of that, and it's no wonder that leaders like Kim Jong Un and Xi Jinping think they can act with impunity.","While Trump wages a political war, dangerous conflicts unfold in Asia",https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/20/opinions/trump-china-india-asia-korea-vinograd/index.html,2020-06-20

(CNN) Last month saw several face-offs between the Indian Army and China's People's Liberation Army along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), their long-disputed shared border, high in the Himalayas.

While the entanglement in North Sikkim was resolved locally, within the framework of mutually agreed-upon protocols, the ones in Eastern Ladakh have lingered, giving rise to speculation about China's intentions.

The last major stand-off between the Asian giants was at Doklam in 2017, and lasted for 73 days. It was followed by informal meetings between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping, first at Wuhan in April 2018 and then at Mamallapuram in Tamil Nadu in October 2019. During those interactions , both leaders reiterated the importance of peace in border areas for greater strategic gains. They also issued guidance to their respective militaries to exercise restraint and strengthen mutual understanding and trust.

At strategic and operational levels, both militaries have exercised restraint. However, at the tactical level, face-offs occur due to differing perceptions of where the actual border is as the LAC is not delineated on the ground. While face-offs get resolved locally, those related to the building of infrastructure, such as roads and defence fortifications, invariably take longer and require a combination of military and diplomatic initiatives.

The bilateral agreements signed between 1993 and 2013 have helped prevent the use of force beyond the occasional fistfights. Not a bullet has been fired by either side since 1975, and that is unlikely to change now.

Facing myriad internal and external challenges during the coronavirus pandemic, China can ill-afford any risky adventurism in the Himalayas. A conflict with India, its main regional strategic competitor, will not only compound its problems but will seriously impede its stated journey towards becoming a global superpower by 2050. Some of the challenges that Xi Jinping faces today include China's contracting economy, its reignited trade war with the US, the departure of some manufacturing and the slowdown of its ambitious Belt and Road Initiative. Hong Kong protests, Taiwan's intransigence, and the global demand to probe its role in the coronavirus pandemic have also added to its woes.

Moreover, barring Pakistan, which is its all-weather strategic partner in the region, Beijing's assertive behavior coupled with its alleged pandemic-related role has generated anti-China sentiment in Asian countries it assiduously befriended as part of its containment strategy against India. India would do well to leverage this to its advantage.

Mutual deterrence

China is aware of the current combat potential of the Indian military, and has seen it evolve into an accountable, responsive and potent element of national power since the 1962 Sino-Indian conflict, over the still-disputed Himalayan border. Both militaries have been training together for many years to develop interoperability to undertake humanitarian assistance, disaster relief and counterterrorism operations. An understanding of each other's military prowess helps create mutual deterrence as each side realizes the grim consequences of a conflict. India, under the present political leadership, has demonstrated its inclination to use force when provoked. The volatile and complex proxy war arena of Jammu and Kashmir has further helped the Indian army to battle-harden its soldiers.

The possibility of Beijing using the face-offs for strategic messaging to India cannot be ruled out. New Delhi has not only joined the international chorus for a probe into the origin and spread of coronavirus pandemic but has also blocked the automatic route for approving foreign direct investments from China. The strengthening strategic partnership between India and the US is another irritant for Beijing. China is known to employ inducement and intimidation means to deal with the external challenges and in the internal domain, whipping up nationalist fervor to eclipse various governance-related failures and inadequacies. The ongoing LAC rows serve both purposes. Unlike the earlier face-offs, this time around, the Chinese mainstream and social media have been extremely active in propagating patriotic narratives.

The reconciliatory statements issued by the Chinese embassy in New Delhi and the Foreign Affairs Office in Beijing point towards China's desire to defuse the border tensions. However, there has been no forward movement on the ground. With India determined to develop the border infrastructure on its territory, as is its right, an early resolution of the entanglements could be difficult. This is a bilateral issue with no scope for any third-party intervention: both India and China have turned down the US proposal for mediation.

Although a conflict in the near future is a remote possibility, India must continue in earnest to develop its military capability to deter aggression and, should that fail, fight to win wars for the country. Relying on any external power to fight India's wars is certainly not a good idea. As an emerging great power, India must carry its own big stick.

But for greater economic and geostrategic gains, a peaceful resolution is the answer. There is enough room in the world for the two Asian giants to grow simultaneously.",Beijing's military adventurism in the Himalayas is risky,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/04/india/india-china-border-oped/index.html,2020-06-04
Analysis Nick Paton Walsh,"(CNN) It is the world's most scrutinized shed. Exactly what happened to an outer building at an Iranian nuclear facility means both everything and nothing, as Tehran grapples with protecting its regional clout during the twin ravages of the coronavirus and US sanctions.

The Natanz nuclear plant lost a building when fire tore through it at 2:06 a.m. local time Thursday. Satellite images beefed up the photos from ground level that slowly led Iranian officials to switch from calling the damage at the facility ""limited"" to ""significant.""

The plant has a florid history: It was the target of Israel's Stuxnet cyber attack in 2010, an attack experts believe was carried out by Israel and the United States, and a focus of the uranium enrichment activity Iran has recently restarted at a higher level since the JCPOA (or nuclear deal) finally collapsed last year. This makes its even partial damage hard to simply dismiss as a broken generator in the summer heat.

The fire came in the middle of a series of unexplained incidents at other facilities. A huge blast hit near the town of Parchin and its military complex last month. Another explosion hit the Zargan power plant in Ahvaz over the weekend and hours later, a chlorine gas leak made dozens ill in southeast Iran. There is such a thing as coincidence, and sanctions mean maintenance issues can be more frequent. But the pattern just added to the speculation around Natanz.

Iran's on-the-record response -- which admitted nothing bar claiming to know the ""main cause"" -- perhaps was the most telling, that it would detail the cause when it suited. You might assess that a government dealing with economic difficulties, a persistent pandemic and crippling sanctions, would have preferred to sweep this incident under the carpet, were it just incompetence or an accident. Instead, it has chosen to amplify and prolong the suspicions.

Ipek Yezdani,"(CNN) Staff who worked at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul around the time of Jamal Khashoggi 's murder told a court Friday that they were told to stay away from the residence on the day the dissident journalist went missing in 2018.

A cleaning lady, two drivers, and a technical worker were all denied access or told not to show up to work on October 2, they said on the first day of the trial at a Turkish court.

Consulate technical worker Zeki Demir said he was initially told that there would be renovations at Consul General Mohammed al-Otaibi's home but was then asked to come in at 2 p.m.

""There were five or six people there. They stopped me from coming through the three entrances. They asked me to light up the tandoor (oven). There was an atmosphere of panic,"" he said.

""I lit up the tandoor and they spoke with each other. I joked saying that if you fall in the tandoor then you will become kebabs. Then I left.""

The Consul General's driver, Hakan Guven told the court that he took al-Otaibi and his family to the airport on October 8. Guven said al-Otaibi told him that he would return.

Their statements were included in the indictment, which lays out in detail the events leading up to the afternoon of October 2, when Khashoggi walked into the Saudi consulate in a busy business district in Istanbul to pick up papers that would have allowed him to marry his fiancée Hatice Cengiz. He never emerged.

Lawyers for the 20 Saudi defendants, assigned by Turkey's Bar Association for a fair trial, said they were unable to reach their clients.

The suspects named in the indictment include Ahmed al-Assiri, a former deputy head of Saudi Arabia's general intelligence, and Saud al-Qahtani, a former adviser to the Saudi Crown Prince. Both men are accused of ""instigating premeditated torturous murder with monstrous intent."" The remaining 18 defendants are being charged with ""premeditated torturous murder with monstrous intent.""

Cengiz, United Nations special rapporteur Agnes Callamard, representatives of International press Institute (IPI), European Federation of Journalist (EFJ) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) were all present at the trial on Friday.

Cengiz, who is hoping the case will offer new clues to the whereabouts of Khashoggi's remains, told journalists outside the court that the whole process was ""exhausting both spiritually and psychologically"" for her.

""It is a moral responsibility on our shoulders to pursue this murder,"" she said.

Hatice Cengiz hopes the case will offer new clues to the whereabouts of Jamal Khashoggi's remains.

She added that they will continue to seek justice both in Turkey and anywhere in the world.

Callamard, the UN special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary killings, said: ""We are sending a very strong message to dictators around the world that they cannot get away with killing a journalist.""

Saudi Arabia held a trial in December and found eight people guilty of charges relating to Khashoggi's death, but the proceedings were opaque and the defendants' identities were not revealed. Callamard said that hearing from the witnesses in this formal space would give ""far more legitimacy and strength to their statement.""

""We're moving into a space of justice. The Saudi process was anything but justice, it was a travesty of justice in my opinion and it was closed, secret trial. Here we have a space where the victims are heard in a way that they have never been heard before,"" she told media outside the court.

""It is important for truth telling because more information is coming up and more information will come up,"" she added.

Despite her findings that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman knew about the murder, he was not mentioned by name at the hearing, Callamard added.

""He was mentioned in a tangential fashion,"" she said.

She said she was unsure whether this was because of his diplomatic immunity or whether it was because the prosecution did not have enough evidence.

Ankara has repeatedly called for the suspects to be extradited and tried in Turkey where the crime took place. Riyadh has not complied with the request.

The Turkish indictment outlines a conspiracy among the defendants. It includes CCTV footage of the movement of the suspects — 15 of whom flew into Turkey from Saudi Arabia ahead of the killing — as well as eyewitness testimony from Turkish workers in the consulate who were given time off on the day of the murder.

The trial has brought fresh hope for Cengiz, who says she will not stop pursuing justice for her slain fiancée.

""I will continue to pursue all legal avenues to hold Jamal's killers accountable and I will not rest until we get Justice for Jamal,"" she said in a written statement to CNN. ""Jamal's killers and those who ordered his murder have evaded justice thus far. I hope this criminal case in Turkey brings to light the whereabouts of Jamal's body, the evidence against the killers and the evidence of those behind the gruesome murder.""

The Saudi government has presented shifting stories about Khashoggi's fate in the months following his death. Initially Saudi officials denied any knowledge of the journalist's whereabouts, then shifted to arguing that a group of rogue operators carried out the murder without the involvement of Bin Salman . Turkish officials have said Riyadh has not been cooperative in their investigation.

US officials, however, have said such a mission -- including the 15-man hit squad sent from Riyadh -- could not have been carried out without the authorization of Bin Salman, and the CIA concluded that the Crown Prince had ordered the killing. Saudi authorities have vehemently denied the allegations.

In December 2019, 11 unnamed suspects were put on trial in Saudi Arabi. Eight people were found guilty of charges related to Khashoggi's death, five of whom were sentenced to death. They were later pardoned by one of Khashoggi's sons, sparing them from the death penalty in accordance with Saudi legal custom.

Al-Qahtani and al-Assiri were cleared by Saudi authorities. Both men, part of the Crown Prince's inner circle , were relieved of their duties in the immediate aftermath of Khashoggi's killing.

In a report last year, Callamard concluded that Saudi Arabia was responsible under international law for the ""deliberate, premeditated execution"" of Khashoggi, and called for an investigation into the role of the Crown Prince, saying there was ""credible evidence meriting further investigation.""

Palantir said this week that it confidentially filed paperwork with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to go public. As with any publicly-traded company, Palantir would need to disclose more of its financial history and open itself to investor scrutiny. And as with any tech company of its size — with a roughly $20 billion valuation — its initial public offering would likely be a high-profile event.

""If they do go down the IPO path, it would be a seminal moment in technology, very similar to the likes of Uber and Lyft that were private for many years then went public,"" said Daniel Ives, an analyst with Wedbush who tracks tech companies.

Named after the seeing stones in J.R.R. Tolkien's fantasy novel ""The Lord of the Rings,"" Palantir is based in Palo Alto, California. The company has two products that customers use to organize and glean insights from mounds of data: Gotham, which was initially developed for government clients, and Foundry. Any data contained in SEC filings yet to be released publicly would almost certainly reveal more.

With Palantir's IPO, there's more at stake than investor returns. Some hope an IPO would lead to greater transparency, like Jacinta Gonzalez, senior campaign organizer of organizing group Mijente, which has long been critical of Palantir for its work with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and its ties to the Trump administration. But she's also worried that a successful IPO will show more companies that policing is good for business.

Palantir spokeswoman Lisa Gordon declined to comment for this story, citing the quiet period Palantir entered as it began the IPO process.

A history of bold claims—and controversial work

Cofounded in 2003 by Peter Thiel, a member of the so-called ""PayPal mafia"" and a longtime Facebook board member known for supporting Trump's 2016 campaign, Palantir's stated mission is to ""make the West, especially America, the strongest in the world."" The company touts its ability to manage and secure data at a massive scale.

Yet it has historically been quiet about the precise ways in which its services are used, which has earned the company a shadowy reputation. What's clear is that maintaining a relationship with the government has been key to the company for much of its history.

In its early years, Palantir struggled to get investors and clients, before raising money from the CIA's investment arm, In-Q-Tel, as well as from Thiel and his VC firm Founders Fund. Since then, the company has taken on work with the US government that others in Silicon Valley might not have been comfortable with.

Peter Thiel, co-founder of Palantir Technologies Inc., speaks during a news conference in Tokyo, Japan, on Monday, Nov. 18, 2019.

In 2017, CNN reported that Palantir had helped the Los Angeles Police Department analyze data , ranging from license plates photos to rap sheets, traffic tickets, listings of foreclosed properties and more. While this can make it easier for police to do things like track down criminals, it also indicates how technology such as Palantir's offers law enforcement unprecedented surveillance capabilities.

More recently, Karp said in an interview with CNBC at Davos in January that Palantir has been assisting with finding undocumented immigrants for deportation — something that had long been rumored but unconfirmed.

""We take what amounts to strong but often controversial positions,"" Karp said at the time.

And in May, Karp acknowledged in an interview with Axios on HBO that Palantir's technology ""is used on occasion to kill people."" He made clear that it can be used for targeting of all kinds, including people. ""If you're looking for a terrorist in the world now you're probably using our government product and you're probably doing the operation that actually takes out the person in another product we built,"" he said, most likely referring to Gotham and Foundry, respectively.

At a time when companies such as Amazon and Microsoft said they have halted the sale of some contested technology — namely facial-recognition systems — to US police departments, Palantir is ""sort of the opposite,"" said Evan Greer, deputy director at digital rights nonprofit Fight for the Future.

""I think companies like Palantir are allowing governments and institutions to weaponize our data and use it in ways that oppress people rather than lift them up,"" Greer said.

The contrarian may cash in again

Just as Palantir is among the most controversial companies in Silicon Valley, so is its most famous cofounder.

He was also discovered to be bankrolling the lawsuit of Terry Bollea, popularly known as the wrestler Hulk Hogan, against Gawker Media that forced the publisher into bankruptcy. Yet he has also donated to the Committee to Protect Journalists.

""It's precisely because I respect journalists that I do not believe they are endangered by fighting back against Gawker,"" he said in a 2016 interview , as part of his explanation for why he didn't think the two activities contradicted each other.

A libertarian, he served as a surrogate for Donald Trump's 2016 campaign, going against many powerful tech CEOs and criticizing Silicon Valley in the process.

Thiel, who has invested at least $40 million in Palantir, has defended the company's role despite his previously articulated anti-government approach. ""The government was collecting a lot of data [in the war on terrorism], more than they could analyze,"" he told Fortune in March 2016. ""If we could help them make sense of data, they could end indiscriminate surveillance.""

Unlike PayPal, which was inspired by the idea of creating a currency ""free from all government control and dilution,"" Palantir is helping empower government agencies: it scored $1.5 billion in new contracts with the US government in 2019 alone.

But Palantir may have at least one thing in common with PayPal: it will likely make Thiel a lot of money.",A secretive and controversial startup may go public. Here's what you should know about it,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/10/tech/palantir-ipo-explainer/index.html,2020-07-10
Chris Isidore,"New York (CNN Business) Ford CEO Jim Hackett rejected employees' calls to get out of the police car business, saying the automaker can support the Black Lives Matter movement while selling the majority of America's police cars.

Ford F Hackett, in a recent memo to staff, acknowledged that someemployees are urging the company to stop making police cars because of a series of high-profile killings of Black Americans by police. A public petition on Change.org has also gathered about 12,000 signatures over the last month, urging Ford to refuse sales and service of cars to police departments ""using violent tactics.""

The police car that George Floyd was lying next to when he was killed was a Ford. The Ford Interceptor is widely acknowledged as the nation's best-selling police vehicle vehicle, although Ford has not broken out the number of vehicles it has sold. There are no firm figures on its market share, but industry experts believe it to be in the 60% range.

Hackett said the automaker opposes police misconduct.

""It should be clear both [Chairman] Bill Ford and I believe deeply that there is no room for the systemic repression and racism that have been exhibited by law enforcement encounters gone wrong,"" Hackett said in the memo late last month, which became public this week. ""We've said clearly that Black Lives Matter. We do believe strongly that more transparency and accountability is required in police operations.""

Analysis Laura He,"The benchmarkIndex stormed into a bull market to start the week as Chinese state media called on local investors to pour money into markets, assuring them that the economy is recovering from the coronavirus pandemic and the country is headed for a period of great prosperity. By Friday, the index had closed out its best week in five years. Trading volume exploded, with daily turnover soaring nearly 80% compared to last week.

International onlookers are noticing the surge. Goldman Sachs this week predicted the CSI 300 — an index of big cap stocks in Shanghai and Shenzhen — would rise another 15% within the next few months, which the analysts attributed to a ""robust economic reopening"" and ""positive government rhetoric towards the equity market,"" among other factors.

China's stock markets are not open in the way other major international exchanges are. Virtually all investors in mainland stock markets are individual traders, according to recent survey data from the China Securities Depository and Clearing Corporation.

But the rally is significant for what it says about how eager the country is to project an image of a healthy stock market to the rest of the world, particularly as it comes under an increasing level of international scrutiny over its handling of the coronavirus outbreak and the implementation of a sweeping national security law in Hong Kong.

""The rally projects Beijing's preferred image of a thriving, successful society,"" said Brock Silvers, chief investment officer for Hong Kong-based Adamas Asset Management.

There are risks to jumping too high, too fast, though — something of which China seems keenly aware.

""A rising stock market will ease companies' fundraising difficulties, boost the real economy and accelerate work resumption,"" wrote the state-owned Economic Daily in a commentary piece published Friday. ""But a bull market doesn't mean we should let the market get out of control.""

Stocks cooled somewhat on Friday: The Shanghai Composite, for example, lost nearly 2%, though that wasn't enough to kill its historic gain. State media reports attributed the retreat to news that the country's social security reserve fund would unload hundreds of millions of shares in a major state insurer, the People's Insurance Company of China — a warning sign that Beijing might think the market surge is happening too quickly.

Analysts also warn that the bull run could risk losing steam. Though China's economy is recovering, it remains weak , said Silvers. He added that the economic implications of the security law in Hong Kong are also not yet known, and pointed out that tensions between the United States and China might cause more economic woes.

""To the extent that the image isn't supported by underlying economic fundamentals, it may prove to be something of a mirage,"" Silvers said. ""Today's equity bulls may pay the price.""

A risky strategy

""The decoupling between stock prices and economic fundamentals is not a 'China phenomenon' per se, but a global one,"" said Jing Sima, a China investment strategist at BCA Research. ""In fact, Chinese stocks have not diverged from domestic economic fundamentals as much as their global peers.""

And just as US President Donald Trump frequently links the success of his presidency and the economy to how well the stock market is doing, former top officials in China have joined the country's state media in arguing that a bull market is needed to offset economic headwinds.

""The central leading body of the [Chinese Communist Party] has never attached as much importance to the capital market as it does now,"" said Xiao Gang, the former chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, during a financial conference on Tuesday.

Xiao — who presided over the commission during the China's stock market turbulence of 2015 — called on the country to transform its economy and compete with the West on technology and financial development.

But ""using the stock market as a tool to shore up the economy is a risky strategy,"" wrote Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist for Capital Economics, in a Thursday research note.

He said there are some economic benefits to a market rally, such as making it easier for firms that are publicly listed to raise cash when their balance sheets are under strain. A flurry of trading activity would also directly boost GDP, he added.

But Evans-Pritchard said a state endorsement of rising prices would encourage investors to view the market as a ""one-way bet.""

""Once a major rally takes hold, it can become self-feeding as retail investors pile in,"" he said.

Echoes of 2015

The biggest concern is whether the boom in China's stock market could be followed by a major bust, like what happened in 2015. That summer, the Shanghai Composite collapsed 30% in three weeks after gaining 150% in a year. The volatility — which experts attributed to slowing economic growth and risky trading practices , compounded by a bullish state media — continued for months, triggering a global rout.

""Despite belated official efforts to tame the rally in 2015, prices kept rising and departing further from economic fundamentals until they collapsed under their own weight,"" Evans-Pritchard wrote.

There are some similarities between now and then. The rise in 2014-2015 was characterized by new traders flooding into the market, wrote Oliver Jones, senior markets economist at Capital Economics, in a Thursday research note. He noted that trading volumes have increased in China recently, too.

Chinese state media is also once again acting as a cheerleader for the market surge. Jones noted that the Shanghai Composite and Shenzhen Composite indexes surged Monday ""despite no major news on the economy or the spread of coronavirus, after an editorial in state media sanctioned the 'healthy' rally.""

But there are reasons to believe that things will be different this time around. Evans-Pritchard said it's encouraging that the pickup in margin trading — using borrowed funds to make investments — is more modest than it was then. He added that tighter restrictions on secretive borrowing and lending practices should have also reduced risks.

""But stricter access to leverage won't necessarily avert a bubble,"" he said, adding that ""officials will need to act quickly to take some steam out of the rally and prevent expectations becoming too one-sided.""","Chinese stocks are on an incredible run.

Jordan Valinsky,"New York (CNN Business) Walmart is reportedly close to launching its own membership program that closely resembles Amazon Prime.

The retailer plans to unveil Walmart+ in July, a $98 per year service that includes same-day delivery, fuel discounts and other perks, according to Recode. Introduction of the service was pushed back from the spring because of the pandemic and it's unclear if it will initially launch nationally.

Walmart WMT declined to comment.

If Walmart+ enjoys just a fraction of success of Amazon Prime, Walmart should be pleased. Amazon recently said it has 150 million subscribers paying $119 annually. Prime includes expedited shipping, streaming entertainment, same-day grocery delivery and early access to deals.

Jackie Wattles,"New York (CNN Business) As the Covid-19 pandemic continues to spread throughout the United States, travelers are still not federally required to wear a mask on a passenger jet. But Delta CEO Ed Bastian said the government should make it a mandate.

He's not optimistic, however, that a national mask requirement will happen.

The airline industry has not issued a strong collective message asking the government to take that step, Bastian told CNN's Poppy Harlow for Boss FIles

""We've had those discussions with the White House,"" he said.

""I feel strongly about it,"" Bastian added. ""But I'm not sure some of my peers and other airlines feel the same way. So as a practical matter, I'm not sure it's gonna happen.""

The White House would not comment on the matter.

The vast majority — ""99.9%,"" Bastian said — of Delta fliers are following the rules. But for the passengers that don't comply, enforcing the rule is tricky

The rules were fairly lax in the early days of the pandemic, when few people were flying. Last month, US airlines moved to ban passengers from booking future travel if they did not wear masks, and all three major carriers said they have already done so for an undisclosed number of customers.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that everyone ""should wear a cloth face cover when they have to go out in public"" to reduce transmission and slow the spread of the coronavirus, which is highly contagious.

But President Donald Trump has consistently refused to wear a mask in public, even as the pandemic has worsened in the United States. (The White House has said that everyone who comes in contact with the President is tested for coronavirus regularly.) Some cities and states have begun implementing their own mask policies, but that and other pandemic-related health orders have faced strong backlash in conservative parts of the country.

""I think I can speak for corporate America: We're all frustrated with the politicization of safeguarding the health and well-being of our employees, as well as our customers,"" Bastian said.

He added that most Delta customers have been respectful when asked to wear a face covering. ""We ask our customers to wear the mask, not only to safeguard themselves, but just as importantly safeguard others,"" Bastian said.

Delta's Covid-19 policies have been among the industry's strongest. Delta has said it will keep all middle seats empty on its planes at least through the end of September, parting ways with American Airlines and United, which have said that move does not keep passengers safer.

Bastion said Delta consulted with medical experts at the Mayo Clinic and Emory University in its decision making.

""I think it's a really important safety feature,"" he said. ""Distance matters.""

Airlines have been anxious to fill seats as the steep drop-off in air travel has left thousands of planes grounded. Bastian said he agreed with Warren Buffet's recent comments that airlines had too many planes in their fleets.

US carriers are bleeding millions of dollars a day, and, despite receiving billions in federal bailout money, the industry may lose thousands of jobs this fall. United warned 36,000 of its frontline workers they could be furloughed this fall.

Bastian said Delta is currently losing about $30 million a day, down from $100 million per day a few weeks ago. He added that Delta is facing potential layoffs, ""but not nearly the level that United communicated.""

But layoffs aren't inevitable, he said, because Delta knows there will be political fallout if the company accepts more money from the government and then lays off thousands more.

""That would be something that that airline would have to explain,"" Bastian said, ""both to the government as well as to its employees and community.""",Exclusive: Delta CEO says federal government should issue a mask mandate,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/10/business/delta-ceo-masks-airplane-ed-bastian/index.html,2020-07-10
Matt Egan,"New York (CNN Business) Americans' credit card debt is shrinking rapidly during the coronavirus recession. That's a sharp contrast with the last two economic downturns.

The amount of consumer revolving credit, which is mostly credit cards, plunged by another $24 billion in May, the Federal Reserve said Wednesday. This costly form of debt is down more than $100 billion since hitting a record high in February and is now below $1 trillion for the first time in nearly three years.

The dwindling pile of credit card debt is yet more evidence of how drastically consumer behavior is changing during the pandemic and this period of financial insecurity.

In many ways, it makes perfect sense that Americans are swiping the plastic less. The health crisis, forced the widespread shutdown of restaurants, bars and professional sports. That was especially true during the March-May period captured by the Fed data.

""Consumers had no choice but to spend less on their credit cards,"" Danielle DiMartino Booth, CEO and chief strategist at Quill Intelligence, wrote in a note to clients Thursday.

Not surprisingly, spending at restaurants imploded during the spring when health restrictions made eating out impossible in many parts of the nation.

The seven-day average of spending (including on credit cards) at big chain restaurants was down by as much as 40% in April from the year before, according to Bank of America. That metric has since recovered in June to normal levels, Bank of America said.

Mass unemployment, wave of bankruptcies

At the same time, Americans are wisely paying down outstanding credit card balances and avoiding racking up new debt during this economically tumultuous period.

""Americans are behaving in an eminently rational fashion,"" said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM International.

The unemployment rate surged to 14.7% in April. It has since dipped to 11.1% due to blockbuster job gains , though that unemployment rate is still higher than at any point during the Great Recession.

Given that backdrop, it's little surprise that Americans are pulling back on debt. The March-May period marked the first time in a decade that overall consumer credit declined for three months in a row, according to Oxford Economics.

However, some types of debt are showing signs of life. Specifically, the amount of nonrevolving credit, which is mostly student debt and auto loans, actually rose by $6 billion in May.

Signals consumers are hunkering down

Credit card debt typically carries punishing interest rates -- even for borrowers with the strongest credit scores. The fact that this type of pricey debt is shrinking is encouraging given the economic uncertainty.

However, this trend, along with the surging saving rate, also reflects a broader hunkering down among Americans that is problematic for an economy that is two-thirds driven by consumer spending.

""That's bad news for the economy,"" Brusuelas said. ""You want a confident consumer to expense her income. We're just not seeing that right now.""

Shrinking credit card debt also highlights the unprecedented support being provided by Uncle Sam right now.

More so than during the onset of the past two recessions, Congress and the White House have taken bold steps to provide emergency relief to households and businesses via the CARES Act.

Specifically, stimulus checks of up to $1,200 per household were sent out in the spring. And the federal government is providing $600 of extra weekly unemployment benefits for people who lost their jobs during the pandemic.

Stimulus cliff

Taken together, those emergency moves have lessened the reliance on swiping the plastic.

""The need for credit cards as a smoothing mechanism has been greatly diminished,"" according to Booth, the Quill Intelligence CEO. ""The credit cycle that would have begun to emerge has been frozen by the CARES Act.""

But the problem is the $600 of enhanced unemployment benefits expires at the end of July. And there is a heated debate among economists and politicians about whether extending them at the current level -- or at all -- will discourage Americans to look for new jobs.

What is clear, however, is that letting this benefit lapse will force some unemployed Americans, particularly those in lower-income households, to rely on expensive credit card debt to make ends meet.

That means the recent plunge in credit card debt may prove to be short-lived -- but potentially for the wrong reasons.",Americans are rapidly shrinking their credit card debt during the pandemic,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/09/investing/credit-card-debt-recession/index.html,2020-07-09
Parija Kavilanz,"The new work-from-home reality has rapidly recalibrated the fashion code for professional wear, and that spells trouble for the retailers who sell formal office clothing.

On Wednesday, Brooks Brothers, the 202-year-old menswear retailer that has dressed 40 US presidents and is synonymous with the classic Wall Street banker look, filed for bankruptcy as demand for suits plummeted amid the pandemic.

Meanwhile, Ascena Retail Group, which owns Ann Taylor and Lane Bryant apparel chains, told Bloomberg it's weighing all options to stay afloat after its business was hit hard by a pullback in clothing purchases, including officewear. Ascena is reportedly planning to shut at least 1,200 stores . It has 2,800 locations in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico.

The turbulence has ensnared Men's Wearhouse , too. With more than 10 million men who've lost their jobs and millions more working from home in recent months, buying a suit is hardly a priority . Tailored Brands, which owns Men's Wearhouse, could be another retailer in the space mulling bankruptcy

Ascena did not immediately respond to request for comment, and Tailored Brands declined to comment.

With more work calls and team meetings now taking place from the comfort of home, office wear has become decidedly more relaxed. It's a shift that's been occurring for years, as employers in more buttoned up industries like financial services competed for talent with tech companies and upstarts that had their own, more laid-back work cultures.

'Nail in the coffin'

The pandemic may have ended formality forever.

""Brooks Brothers' bankruptcy filing is really quite incredible,"" said Jessica Cadmus, a New York-based stylist whose clients mostly work in the finance industry.

Cadmus worked at Brooks Brothers earlier in her career, helping to set up a client concierge service for the company's flagship store on New York's Madison Avenue. ""The reality is that workwear trends have been shifting for a while now and sadly the pandemic was the final nail in the coffin.""

Even prior to the national shutdown, Cadmus said her clients were gravitating to a more relaxed work look. ""There was an enormous shift taking place towards business casual,"" she said.

Jessica Cadmus, a stylist whose clients mostly work in the finance sector, said the pandemic has accelerated a drop in demand for formal workwear like tailored suits.

Goldman Sachs announced that its employees Last year,Goldman Sachs announced that its employees could start dressing down for the office . The Wall Street firm has historically favored collared shirts and suits.

""Then when Covid-19 hit and people were forced to work from home, there was an absolute halt in buying formal workwear,"" said Cadmus. ""The emphasis from my clients now is on polished loungewear, where the fit is not as tailored and comfort is key.""

Her male clients, she said, are looking for new shirts but not trousers. ""They are not asking about sports coats, suits, or shoes. It's just shirts,"" she said. Women want statement necklaces, earrings and broaches instead of suits and dresses for a more put together look for video calls.

Some people aren't even changing out of their pajamas . In June, 47% of consumers told market research firm NPD they are wearing the same clothes throughout most of their day while at home during the pandemic, and nearly a quarter said they liked wearing activewear, sleepwear, or loungewear most of the day.

""People clearly do not want to change into multiple outfits throughout the day, especially under these circumstances,"" Maria Rugolo, NPD's apparel industry analyst, said. ""It is about blending and maximizing one's wardrobe. They still want to look presentable for work, but also want to feel comfortable.""

Personal stylist Nicola Harrison working with a client.

Stylist Nicola Harrison, whose clients include professionals in finance and other industries, acknowledges that workwear is now less dressy.

""But I've also been pushing against it,"" she said. ""For men, suits and sports coats provide a polished, professional look. And let's be honest, they are very forgiving and hide a multitude of sins.""

For her, casual is acceptable at work to a degree. ""Dark jeans, button-down shirt, a sports coat. You just shouldn't go too far in the other direction because you are working from home."" Her ""don'ts?"" Ill-fitting polo shirts or clothes from your college days.

Oliver Darcy,"The top writer for Fox News host Tucker Carlson has for years been using a pseudonym to post bigoted remarks on an online forum that is a hotbed for racist, sexist, and other offensive content, CNN Business learned this week.

Just this week, the writer, Blake Neff, responded to a thread started by another user in 2018 with the subject line, ""Would u let a JET BLACK congo n****er do lasik eye surgery on u for 50% off?"" Neff wrote, ""I wouldn't get LASIK from an Asian for free, so no."" (The subject line was not censored on the forum.) On June 5, Neff wrote, ""Black doods staying inside playing Call of Duty is probably one of the biggest factors keeping crime down."" On June 24, Neff commented, ""Honestly given how tired black people always claim to be, maybe the real crisis is their lack of sleep."" On June 26, Neff wrote that the only people who care about changing the name of the NFL's Washington Redskins are ""white libs and their university-'educated' pets.""

And over the course of five years, Neff has maintained a lengthy thread in which he has derided a woman and posted information about her dating life that has invited other users to mock her and invade her privacy. There has at times also been overlap between some material he posted or saw on the forum and Carlson's show.

CNN Business contacted Neff for comment Thursday night. After he or someone acting on his behalf passed that email to Fox News spokespeople, a network spokesperson on Friday morning told CNN Business that Neff had resigned. A Fox News spokesperson said Carlson could not be reached for comment. Neff did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

Neff worked at Fox News for nearly four years and was Carlson's top writer. Previously, he was a reporter at The Daily Caller, a conservative news outlet that Carlson co-founded. In a recent article in the Dartmouth Alumni Magazine , Neff said, ""Anything [Carlson is] reading off the teleprompter, the first draft was written by me."" He also acknowledged the show's influence, telling the magazine, ""We're very aware that we do have that power to sway the conversation, so we try to use it responsibly.""

When asked in a 2018 appearance on Fox's ""The Five"" about the writing process for his show, Carlson said he spends hours working on scripts, but referred to Neff by name, saying he was a ""wonderful writer"" and acknowledging his assistance. And Carlson credited Neff in the acknowledgments of his book, ""Ship of Fools,"" for providing research. In the acknowledgments, Carlson said that Neff and two others who helped with the book ""work on and greatly improve our nightly show on Fox.""

During the years that Neff wrote for him at Fox, Carlson has hosted one of the most influential shows on cable news. In the last quarter, Carlson had not only the highest-rated program in cable news, but the highest-rated show in the history of cable news . Carlson also counts President Trump among his most loyal viewers. On multiple occasions, the President has tweeted out videos of Carlson's program. Which is to say, the scripts that Neff likely helped write and shape were being shared by the President of the United States.

While working at Fox News, and while a reporter at The Daily Caller, Neff was a frequent poster on AutoAdmit. Also known as XOXOhth, it is a relatively unmoderated message board like 4chan aimed at lawyers and law school students in which racism and sexism run rampant. The board's vulgar content was previously the subject of much criticism, and two Yale students sued anonymous posters on the site in 2007 alleging they had defamed them and made threatening remarks. The Hartford Courant reported in 2009 that the lawsuit was quietly settled after some of the posters were identified.

Neff, who posts on the board under the username CharlesXII, is widely revered on the forum, with many posters knowing the person behind the account works on Carlson's show. He has spent years posting about history, offering his political opinions, and detailing aspects of his personal life.

After learning of Neff's posts on the board through an email from an anonymous tipster, CNN Business was able to positively identify CharlesXII as Neff by reviewing messages he has posted throughout the years on the forum and matching them up with publicly available information about him.

Among the details which make clear that CharlesXII and Neff are the same person: CharlesXII indicated on the board that he had gone to Dartmouth; Neff is an alumnus. CharlesXII said he had been working for nearly four years in his current journalism job in Washington DC; Neff has been working for Carlson at Fox in Washington since February 2017, according to his LinkedIn profile, which appears to have been removed after his resignation from Fox News. CharlesXII said on the board that he got his start in journalism after he turned down law school and instead took a fellowship; Neff told the Dartmouth Alumni Magazine that he took a fellowship with the Collegiate Network.

CharlesXII also wrote a parody version of the song ""We Didn't Start The Fire"" and posted about it on the board, including a screen shot of an email he received from Carlson praising a lyric in the song. Neff sang the parody song at a Daily Caller Christmas party a few years ago, according to a person familiar with the event.

The Daily Caller declined to comment.

And in a 2017 Washington Post Date Lab article featuring Neff, he dropped a number of Easter eggs for the board, including referencing an ""alcohol is poison"" meme that he has repeatedly posted about and carrying a book on Catherine the Great to a date. His username on the forum, CharlesXII, is a reference to Charles XII of Sweden, a king known for his military victories and who abstained from sex and alcohol. Neff, a history buff interested in wars and military battles, has repeatedly disclosed on the forum that he rarely drinks and The Post story said he rarely dates.

Even more clearly identifying, however, were photos that CharlesXII posted to the forum in 2018 to the forum after visiting a museum in Egypt. In three of the photos, a reflection of Neff is visible snapping the pictures in the artifacts' glass enclosures.

While at Fox News, Carlson has been accused by critics of making racist and inflammatory comments on air. His show has long appealed to extremists who agree with his hardline views on immigration, his emphasis on the preservation of Western culture, and his commentary on topics of race.

Carlson has at several points in his Fox News career found himself in hot water when commenting on such topics. In August 2019, for instance, Carlson became engulfed in controversy when he said the very real problem of white supremacy in America was a ""hoax."" Most recently, Carlson saw more advertisers — including Disney and T-Mobile — flee his program in June after he said the Black Lives Matter movement was ""not about black lives"" and warned viewers to ""remember that when they come for you."" (A Fox News spokesperson later said Carlson was referring to Democratic leaders, not Black Lives Matter protesters, when he made the comments.)

Carlson himself has in the past pushed back against allegations of racism. He told The Atlantic in December 2019 that such accusations are ""so far from the truth"" that it has ""no effect at all other than to evoke in me contempt for the people saying it"" because he thinks ""it's that dishonest.""

Bigotry and vitriol

In 2015, Neff started a thread on AutoAdmit mocking a woman, with whom he was friends on Facebook and whom he described as an ""Azn megashrew,"" sharing posts she had written about her dating life. He has continued to post to the thread and mock the woman, whom CNN Business is not identifying, as recently as late last month. In his first post in 2015 starting the years-long thread, he explained that ""through circumstances"" he couldn't ""quite recall,"" he became Facebook friends with the woman and thought her posts about dating were amusing.

""So, I thought I'd post them,"" Neff wrote. ""I won't put up a pic but it's probably relevant to say that she's a slightly overweight Azn woman who is in her mid-30s and definitely looks it.""

Through the years, the thread has generated nearly 1,000 comments — many of which used vulgar racist, sexist, and dehumanizing language to mock the woman. Neff also said he did not want other posters to harass her, but did not stop them from identifying her and posting links to her account. He also posted some photos from her account that did not show her face and continued posting about her dating life for years after the other posters had identified her.

Reached for comment, the woman told CNN Business, ""When I was recently made aware of Blake's posts about me on racist websites, I was overcome with disappointment which eventually mixed with bewilderment that he spent years dedicated to creating a false narrative based on my satirical writing about my life. The nature of online media is that your identity, while nominally under your control, is vulnerable to being misused. Any public figure can attest to this problem.""

In March 2020, Neff started another lengthy thread mocking a separate woman with whom he was connected on social media. The woman had posted about freezing her eggs, and Neff apparently found that worth deriding in the AutoAdmit forum. He began posting about her in March of this year, in a thread he titled ""Disaster: WuFlu outbreak endangers aging shrew's quest to freeze eggs."" Neff posted to the thread, which racked up dozens of comments as users ridicule the woman, as recently as June 28.

I was overcome with disappointment which eventually mixed with bewilderment that he spent years dedicated to creating a false narrative based on my satirical writing about my life. Anonymous

On the forum, Neff has also expressed bigoted views. In 2014, he joked about ""foodie faggots."" And in the same year, he started a thread titled, ""Urban business idea: He Didn't Do Muffin!"" He joked one item could be, ""Sandra Bland's Sugar-free Shortbreads!"" In August 2019, a user started a thread titled, ""We should just buy Canada and kick the Canadians out."" Neff commented, ""Okay but what do we do with the millions of Chinese people.""

More recently, in February 2020, Neff called Mormonism ""an inherently cucky religion."" On June 5, a user on the forum commented in a thread, ""Didn't Michael Brown rob a store and attack a police officer? And wasn't [George Floyd] a piece of shit with a long criminal record? Jfc libs."" Another person commented, ""It doesn't matter to these people."" Neff then replied, ""It does. The violent criminals are even MORE heroic."" On June 16, a user started a separate thread about a video showing a Black man assaulting an elderly white woman in New York. Neff commented on the thread, ""And to think, if this guy got killed in some freak incident while being arrested, we'd have to endure at least three funerals in his honor.""

On the Fourth of July, Neff started a thread in which he jokingly ""rated"" members of the community using images from a 1990s video game from the makers of ""Oregon Trail"" that was pulled from the market due to its racist depictions of slaves. In the game, users play as slaves trying to break free and escape north. Neff assigned users on the forum images from the game, many of which depicted Black slaves using racist stereotypes. For instance, Neff assigned one user an image of a slave catcher, to which the user replied ""[thank you] massa Charles for dis.""

On May 27, Neff wrote that Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley, and Rashida Tlaib — known collectively as ""The Squad"" — want to ""MAKE YOUR COUNTRY A DUMPING GROUND FOR PEOPLE FROM THIRD WORLD SHITHOLES."" Responding to a thread on June 27 about whether ""whites fear what's going to happen to them in 10-20 yrs,"" Neff wrote that he has ""no plans to stay"" in the country ""that long."" In December 2019, he said that ""once Democrats have the majorities to go full F**K WHITEY, things are going to get really wacky really quickly."" He argued at the time that there is a ""large minority of whites who are fully supportive of a F**k Whitey agenda"" and that ""there's a suicidal impulse to Western peoples that honestly feels almost biological in origin.""

When not making his own bigoted comments, Neff has shown a willingness to respond to others who were, without expressing any hesitation, much less disgust, about what they've said. For instance, in 2016 he replied to a thread with the title, ""Mary Poppins getting raped by a pack of wild ni***rs at the park; kids watching."" That same year, he commented on a thread titled, ""DIKES get wrong CUM at CUMBANK. N****R pops out."" Just last month, Neff replied to a comment on the thread that said, ""And the n**s are always honor students or some bullshit."" (The language on both posts was not censored on the forum.)

Last month, Neff mocked a user who said they were leaving the board over concerns about the rampant racism on it. In a now-deleted comment, the user implored others to ""consider the current environment,"" writing, ""The country is undergoing a great awakening to racist injustices throughout society. Maybe you should take this opportunity to consider whether continuing to post here is morally defensible at all, even if you aren't posting deranged shit? I don't think it is defensible, which is why I am leaving.""

On June 16, Neff responded by quoting the user's words and adding, ""LMAO if you think this shit will save you when the mob comes for you. Good riddance."" The language notably echoed Carlson's comment, eight days before, when he had said ""remember that when they come for you.""

In February 2018, a user on AutoAdmit posted, ""At some point in the future, all ur xo posts (w/IRL name) will be public record."" One person commented, ""I stand by every poast."" Neff upvoted that comment.

Easter eggs

When he had just started working at Fox News, Neff was apparently less cautious and more willing to risk exposing his identity for a chance to show off to his fellow posters.

One night in February 2017 -- which, according to his LinkedIn, would have been Neff's second month with Carlson at Fox News — Carlson tripped over his words as he introduced a guest. The phrase Carlson was trying to say was, even for the host's florid style, a little out of place: ""Sweet treats of scholarship.""

Within minutes, Neff was posting to AutoAdmit about Carlson's use of the phrase, which other posters gleefully noted was a reference to something said on the forum.

Neff's caution since then may have resulted in fewer Easter eggs being slipped into Carlson's scripts. But there has still been at least some overlap between the forum and the show, including in recent weeks.

Sometimes, material Neff encountered on the forum found its way on to Carlson's show. For instance, on June 25, Neff responded to a post that quoted a news story about coronavirus-related interest in Montana real estate. He wrote on the forum, ""Interest in real estate in Bozeman, Missoula, and the Flathead Valley has been on the rise for years."" That night, in his monologue, Carlson said, ""You're starting to consider maybe moving to Bozeman, and why wouldn't you?""

In some cases, language Neff used on the forum ended up on the show. The night of June 15, in commenting on a football coach who was the subject of controversy over a sweatshirt he'd worn, Neff wrote on the forum, ""[I]t is your f***ing right as an American to wear whatever T-shirt you want, and hold whatever political views you want. Christ."" The next night on his show, Carlson said, ""And they can wear whatever shirts they want. You thought that was true. You thought that was your right as an American.""

Other times, Neff may have used knowledge he had gained in his job at Fox News to post to the board. On the afternoon of July 1, Neff started a thread titled, ""Two GOP senators propose replacing Columbus Day w/Juneteenth."" In the thread, he wrote, ""Coming out this afternoon if it isn't out already."" That afternoon, it was public; that night, the proposal was discussed on Carlson's show.

Michelle Toh,"Hong Kong (CNN Business) Rising tension between India and China is leading to hiccups in international trade, the suspension of business deals and calls for a boycott of Chinese goods and citizens.

This week, trade organizations said that Chinese shipments were suddenly being held up at Indian checkpoints, highlighting growing strains in a vital trading relationship after the countries clashed in a deadly border battle more than a week ago.

The India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA) — which representsand Foxconn, among other companies — complained to India's Ministry of Finance on Tuesday that all electronic imports from China were being scrutinized at ports in India ""without prior warning.""

""There was refusal to clear followed by delays, and now, talk about 100% examination,"" ICEA chairman Pankaj Mohindroo wrote in a letter to the ministry. ""The logistics of seamless movement is in total disarray.""

The timing is especially stressful because businesses have already been suffering from production snags and other disruptions due to the coronavirus pandemic , noted Mohindroo. He estimated that the sector ""has only recovered to less than 40% of normalcy.""

""In the normal dispensation, goods are cleared automatically without examination,"" Mohindroo wrote. ""We have just begun to limp back to normal after a massive set of losses for three months — and now this.""

The Ministry of Finance declined to comment to CNN Business about the letter.

Other trade organizations are worried too. The Chennai Customs Brokers Association, based in southeastern India, said Tuesday that authorities have been instructing freight handlers across the country ""to hold all consignments which have originated from China.""

Shipments are now expected to be placed ""under hold and subject to a reexamination before release,"" a representative for the group wrote in a notice to members. While there has been no official notice about the new practice, the association warned businesses that there could be delays clearing cargo at ports, airports and customs stations across the country.

Prior to last week's border skirmish, growing anti-China sentiment in India had already led to calls for a boycott of Chinese products and services, while new rules on foreign investment were expected to constrain China's ability to cash in on India's internet boom.

Then the fight at the border happened. Twenty Indian troops died in the violent exchange, sending China and India into a tense diplomatic and military standoff.

The economic stakes are high. India imports more goods from China than any other country. And India and China have enabled each other's rise as technology powerhouses.

In another sign of fraying ties, local authorities in India announced this week that they were hitting pause on more than $600 million in deals with Chinese companies, including one with automaker Great Wall Motors.

A minister for the state of Maharashtra said that officials were waiting for India's central government to assess the current business climate and announce a clear policy about how to move forward on deals with Chinese firms.

Anti-Chinese boycotts

On Thursday, some hotels in New Delhi announced that they would turn away all Chinese guests because of the international spat. The move may be largely symbolic, given that the Covid-19 pandemic has severely restricted travel between countries.

""We have ... decided not to give any room to any Chinese national at a time when China is repeatedly in attacking mode on our brave Indian forces,"" Mahendra Gupta, general secretary of the Delhi Hotel and Restaurant Owners Association, wrote in a letter to another trade organization.

The group has also vowed to stop using ""any Chinese products"" at its businesses, and threatened to contact ""hotel associations of other states to make similar decisions.""

It's not the only organization that has stepped up its rhetoric against China.

The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), an organization that represents millions of small brick-and-mortar stores, is also urging Indians to boycott Chinese goods.

Police detaining an Indian trader who was burning Chinese products during a protest in New Delhi on Monday.

Last week, the group released a list of more than 3,000 Chinese-made products it wants consumers to abandon. The goal of the campaign, it said in a statement, is ""to reduce India's dependence on China for these goods.""

The organization has also called on dozens of business leaders around the country to join the campaign, including Mukesh Ambani , the country's richest man. Ambani's conglomerate, Reliance, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.

CAIT activists are pressing online shopping companies in India to start showing the ""country of origin"" of products sold on their portals, calling it ""a crucial element"" in their campaign.

Priyali Sur,"New Delhi (CNN Business) When India launched its coronavirus tracing app Aarogya Setu in April , it came with a mandatory download order for public sector workers.

That order soon spread to private sector workers and then to people living in designated Covid-19 containment zones —includingRajeev Ghosh, a 50-year old chemist who resides in Noida, a city east of the capital New Delhi.

Back in May, he risked a six-month prison sentence or $15 fine for refusing to download the app. Ghosh didn't care: He had bigger concerns about the future use of his data.

""I am not sure how the government will use my data. If they want, they can do surveillance on me forever through location-tracking on the app,"" said Ghosh.

Ghosh is not alone in his concerns. In Noida, privacy activists mounted a legal challenge to the mandatory download order, and by the end of May it was lifted. They argued that it breached personal liberties protected by a landmark Supreme Court ruling about the right to privacy in 2017

The Indian government maintains that most personal and location data of users is ultimately deleted, but critics say India's lack of data protection laws exposes millions of people to potential privacy breaches. They also fear that personal information could be sold by the government to private companies, or even used for surveillance beyond Covid-19 concerns.

Millions of users

The Aarogya Setu app was developed by the National Informatics Centre, an ICT and e-governance body under the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, in collaboration with voluntary technical experts from private industry and academia.

June, it had been downloaded over By the beginning ofJune, it had been downloaded over 120 million times

Unlike many other countries' contact tracing apps, Aarogya Setu uses Bluetooth and GPS location data to monitor the app users' movement and proximity to other people.

Users are asked to input their name, phone number, age, gender, profession and the countries they have visited in the past 30 days, as well as prior health conditions and a self-assessment about any Covid-19-related symptoms.

A unique digital ID (DiD) is generated for each user, which is used for all future app-related transactions. Through GPS, the app records each users' location every 15 minutes.

When two registered users come within Bluetooth range of each other, their apps automatically exchange DiDs and record the time and location. If one of the users tests positive for Covid-19, the information is uploaded from their phone onto the Indian government's server and used for contact tracing.

As of June 1st, Aarogya Setu had identified 200,000 at-risk people and 3,500 Covid-19 hotspots, according to lead developer Lalitesh Katragadda, the founder of Indihood, a private firm that builds crowdsourcing population-scale platforms, and one of the private industry volunteers who worked with government agencies on the app.

""We have a 24% efficacy rate, that is, 24% of all the people estimated to have Covid-19 because of the app have tested positive,"" said Katragadda. This means that only about 1 in 4 people advised by the app to get a test actually tests positive.

Subhashis Bannerjee, professor of computer science and engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi, said the combination of Bluetooth and GPS location would likely return a higher rate of false positives and false negatives. For example, GPS is often unavailable or unreliable indoors, and Bluetooth overestimates the risks in large open spaces, across walls and floors, which radio waves can penetrate but the virus cannot.

""There seems to be a leap of faith from GPS colocation and Bluetooth radio proximity to estimating a risk score for infection transmission,"" he wrote in a report for the Internet Freedom Foundation (IFF), a non-governmental organization that advocates for digital rights, which has mounted a legal challenge against the mandatory download order in Kerala High Court.

Government safeguards

The Indian government states that enough privacy and protection parameters have been built in to ensure permanent deletion of the app's data.

""All contact tracing and location data on the phone is deleted on a rolling 30-day cycle. The same data on the server is deleted 45 days from the upload unless you test positive. In which case all contact tracing and location information is deleted after 60 days after being declared cured,"" said Abhishek Singh, CEO of MyGov at India's IT ministry.

However, the Aarogya Setu Data Access and Knowledge Sharing Protocol states that de-identified (anonymous) data can be shared with any government ministry or institution, as long as it's for the purpose of tackling Covid-19. Any data received should be permanently deleted after 180 days, the protocol says. But privacy campaigners say there's no way of knowing if that's happened.

""There is no way to check and verify whether the complete destruction of data has taken place and if any third parties with whom the data is shared has also destroyed it,"" said Apar Gupta, a lawyer and executive director of the IFF.

In response to calls for more transparency, the Indian government opened up the app's source code on May 27 and announced a bug bounty program to incentivize software experts to find security vulnerabilities in the app, to rectify lapses, if any.

of ""This is a step in the right direction but to know the full picture of who has access to the data, we need the server code also,"" said Robert Baptiste, an ethical hacker who goes by the aliasof Elliot Alderson and exposed security flaws in the app soon after its launch. An open server code would enable experts to see what citizen data is stored in the government server and how the data is shared.

On June 1, Singh of MyGov, said the government planned to release the server code in a few weeks.

However, Katragadda said that even with the server code, access to information on data sharing would be restricted.

""It will never be possible to see exactly with whom the data is shared because for that we will have to open source the entire government,"" he said.

No data protection laws

One of the main concerns that activists have is that India does not have a data protection law, though a bill is currently being reviewed by a joint select committee and could be passed later this year.

The Personal Data Protection Bill imposes limits on how residents' personal data is used, processed and stored. If passed, the bill would also establish a new regulatory body — the Data Protection Authority (DPA) — to monitor compliance. Critics say the bill is flawed for a number of reasons, including that it allows the government to exempt its departments from the legislation on the basis of national security.

But right now, there are few safeguards for data in India.

""No legislative framework means no official level of accountability. So, if any data mishap happens, there will be no penalty, there will be no safeguards,"" said Gupta.

There's also a financial incentive for the government to share information. The National Economic Survey of India 2018-19 openly states that the Indian government will monetize citizens' data and sell it to private companies to generate revenue.

""India has made a strategy to sell citizen data and is thus making it a commodity by claiming ownership over Indians' personal data, which is against Indians' fundamental right to privacy,"" said Kodali, the public interest technologist.

Last year, the Modi government sold citizens' vehicular registration and driving license data to 87 private companies for 65 crore rupees (approximately $8.7 million) without citizens' consent. This caused a backlash with the opposition party questioning the motives of the government and the price of the sale in parliament.

Despite the government's assurances that all Aarogya Setu data will be deleted, Katragadda told CNN Business that some information from the app will be automatically transferred to the National Health Stack (NHS). The NHS is a cloud-based health registry, currently under development, that will include citizens' medical history, insurance coverage and claims.

""Any residual data from the Aarogya Setu app will automatically move into the National Health Stack within the consent architecture, as soon as the health stack comes into effect,"" said Katragadda.

Residual data means any data that's still on the govt server at the time the NHS becomes active. That includes location, health and personal data that has been downloaded to the server but hasn't yet been deleted in the timeframes laid out by the government, Katragadda said.

No date has been set for the release of the NHS, but Gupta of IFF worries, again, that there's no legal framework to protect the data.

""Even though it is repeatedly stated that consent will be the basis of the information sharing, it's important to note that in both the Aarogya Setu app and NHS, consent is baked into the architecture which is a technical framework rather than a clear source of legal authority.""

Ticket to move

Like other countries that have introduced a contact tracing app, India says the technology is vital to stop the virus from spreading. As of June 22, the country had confirmed more than 410,000 cases and 13,254 deaths.

Air passengers are encouraged to download the app before flights, rail passengers need it for train travel, and some workers have been told they need it to do their jobs.

But digital rights activists say the app carries more risks than it's worth, especially in a country where fewer than 35% of people have the cellphones able to support it.

Citizens and activists also fear function creep of the app, meaning that information obtained through the app could be linked to other services.

""In the past we have seen that technology interventions by this government such as the Aadhar program, which was initially built to ensure that everyone has a digital identity, became a pervasive system, said Gupta.

""Initially built for the purposes of accessing government benefits and subsidies, it was soon mandated for opening bank accounts, availing mobile numbers and going about your business.""

Gupta is referring to Aadhaar, a biometric database introduced in 2009 , initially as a voluntary program to prevent benefit fraud. Now, it contains the fingerprints and iris scans of more than one billion Indians. Users receive a 12-digit identity number that is used to access welfare payments and other government-controlled services.

However, in 2018 a journalist discovered a security breach which disclosed citizens' personal details. The government introduced new security measures, but the scandal eroded trust in its ability to keep data safe.

Before easing off its compulsory download order, India was the only democratic country that made it mandatory for millions of citizens to download the app. The only other countries to impose a similar order were Turkey and China. Campaigners say that alone is cause for concern.

""When it comes to technology and public use, the world's largest democracy is drawing from China's playbook — using national security or a public health crisis to build a digital model of data-gathering, oversight and surveillance,"" said Vidushi Marda, a lawyer working on emerging technology and human rights.

China's Covid-19 app , initially designed for contact-tracing during the pandemic, is now being stitched into a social credit system in some places, where the app is used to track an individual's exercise, alcohol and smoking intake, and sleep hours.

""I would say these kinds of complex technical architectures are not happening in a collective fashion in India, but there is a danger they will be built in through platforms like the National Health Stack,"" said Gupta.",Many Indian citizens believe their government is trying to steal and sell their data.

Peter Valdes-Dapena,"(CNN) Bentley unveiled a sleeker, more muscular version of its Bentayga SUV Tuesday. The changes to the Bentayga are mainly cosmetic but, along with more major changes to Bentley 's product line-up, they mark the completion of a makeover for the brand as it attempts to navigate a rapidly changing marketplace for luxury cars.

With a top speed of 190 miles an hour, the Bentley Bentayga is billed as the world's fastest SUV. It also accounts for nearly half of Bentley's roughly 11,000 global unit sales annually making it the fastest-selling model in the company's history. This latest version is expected to cost about $170,000.

Last week, Bentley marked another important turning point: The last Bentley Mulsanne left the company's assembly line in Crewe, England. At over 18 feet long and with prices starting at over $300,000, the Mulsanne was the company's largest and most expensive automobile. Its demise was a result of shifting market tastes, Bentley CEO Adrian Hallmark said in an interview with CNN Business.

""It's absolutely symbolic of the degree of change that we and our competitors will be going through over the next one to 10 years,"" Hallmark said. ""And this is a perfect example of a segment that just disappeared.""

Bentley sold only about 550 Mulsannes last year, he said. The company made nearly triple that number 20 years ago of its predecessor, the Arnage. Given that, the idea of investing nearly $1 billion in the development of a successor seemed a poor investment.

""There's a lot of cars sold at that price or more, but the number of people wanting a big 'statement sedan' has reduced massively,"" Hallmark said. ""And it's a generational thing. There's not so many younger buyers looking for that kind of product.""

Meanwhile, he said, the market for somewhat smaller vehicles, relatively speaking, in the roughly $200,000 price range of the Bentayga and Bentley's Flying Spur sedan has increased four-fold over the past two decades, he said. That is where the company's investments have gone.

The race to the SUV

Five years ago, Bentley was the first ultra-luxury automaker to come out with an SUV and nearly all of its competitors have followed. Bentley's former sister company, and now competitor, Rolls-Royce now offers the Cullinan , which sells for over $300,000. Lamborghini, which like Bentley is part of the Volkswagen Group , has the Urus . Even Ferrari is working on something with the practical attributes of an SUV (although Ferrari won't call it that).

Bentley occupies a unique spot in the auto industry. Its cars and SUVs are daily drivers for the very wealthy. Unlike a Lamborghini, for instance, a Bentley is not kept in a garage to be brought out only on special occasions or to show off for friends and neighbors. Bentleys, even the two-door Continental models, are comfortable and practical enough to be used as primary transportation for those who can afford them.

They are also, paradoxically, very fast. The company claims both the world's fastest four-sedan in the Flying Spur, and the world's fastest SUV in the Bentayga. The Flying Spur, which is longer than a Mercedes-Benz S-class, can go 207 miles an hour and the Bentayga Speed manages 190.

Neither looks fast. There are no wings or air scoops. They are not shaped like wedges or teardrops They have big shiny grills, hood ornaments and headlights that look like Waterford crystal bowls. Seeing one of these vehicles drive triple-digit speeds would be like watching Usain Bolt run the 200 meters in a Savile Row suit.

The new Bentley Flying Spur is now the brand's flagship car.

Flying Spur, the new flagship

The newest version of the Flying Spur is more striking in appearance than its predecessor. That's fitting as it now takes over from the Mulsanne as the brand's flagship model. It looks stately with a big grill topped with the company's winged B logo that, to protect itself from theft, drops down out of sight when the car is locked.

The powerful 12-cylinder engine provides shocking acceleration with fairly minimal fuss and the Flying Spur corners far better than you would expect of something its size and weight. On a recent drive, only the 8-speed automatic transmission seemed to stumble when demands changed abruptly from hard acceleration to comfortable cruising.

The Bentayga SUV unveiled on Tuesday has not been completely redesigned, but it does look very different, sleeker and sharper. It will be introduced initially with a V8 engine, but the 12-cylinder Speed version and a plug-in hybrid will be available soon. Given the healthy appetite for the vehicle, Hallmark foresees other derivatives coming, as well. That could mean SUVs will comprise an even higher portion of Bentley sales.

The new Bentayga is just coming out as Bentley salvages what was supposed to have been a record-setting year for the brand. The Covid-19 pandemic, which caused Bentley's factory to shut down for seven weeks, is largely to blame. It also sent the world into an economic tailspin that even the likes of Bentley couldn't entirely escape.

Bentley took in over €2 billion, or $2.25 billion, for its parent company, the Volkswagen Group, last year compared to €1.5 billion, or $1.7 billion, in 2018. This year was supposed to be even better but that is in doubt.

""Anybody that thinks that luxury buyers are unaffected by economic downturns has not read history,"" said Hallmark. ""They may still be able to afford luxury products during the downturn but they tend to just switch off.""

The company had about 8,000 orders for the new vehicles going into the pandemic and has lost about 250 to 300 of those, he said. But sales are coming back.

""China has come back with a bullet,"" Hallmark said. ""The US market is being incredibly strong for us.""

Still, Bentley announced last month that it was cutting 1,000 jobs, or about a quarter of the workforce, from its facilities in Crewe. Improved efficiency had made that possible and the cuts had been planned to take place over the next couple of years, Hallmark said. The pandemic accelerated things, though, so the job cuts are being made now.

With a fresh product lineup and markets such as China and Europe coming back, Hallmark is optimistic. Europe is only just starting to reopen but, in China, Bentley took over 600 orders each month in April and in May, where an average month is less than half that, Hallmark said. Some of that is no doubt due to pent up demand, he said, but it shows promise for the future. In the short term, the question remains whether the strong upturn in sales will continue and if there will be more waves of Covid-19 around the world.

Then there's the question of Britain's exit from the European Union due to happen, one way or another, by end of this year.

Be honest: How much do you feel like you belong at work?

It might sound like an odd question, but the answer is important.

Feeling like you're part of the team and you're being seen and supported at work is a big part of being happy in your career, reports CNN Business' Jeanne Sahadi. Employees that have a sense of belonging are more likely to stay and succeed -- which is good news for employers.

But a new study found that White workers report a higher sense of belonging than their Black, Hispanic and Asian colleagues.

""Employees who belong to groups that have not traditionally been represented in the workplace step into their careers at a disadvantage, and begin a journey riddled with reminders that they're outside the norm; that they are 'other,'"" the report notes.

So what can employers do to help promote a better sense of belonging?

To start, they should proactively and regularly check in with employees given all the stresses of the world right now, Sahadi writes. The key is to listen to their concerns and identify ways you can help address some of the worries.

Providing regular feedback is also important -- this allows workers a chance to adjust their performance to meet expectations. But it needs to be honest and specific in order to be helpful.

Increasing accessibility to senior leaders can also lead to a better sense of belonging in the workplace.

Saving more American jobs

Here's a title that no country wants: Home of the largest increase in unemployment of any major economy.

But here we are.

And now it's time for Congress to act in order to restore and preserve US jobs, writes Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics; Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and Antonio Weiss, a research fellow at Harvard Kennedy School's Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government, for CNN Business' Perspectives.

The coronavirus is a worldwide problem, but other countries, like Germany and Australia, have employee retention programs that have kept a lid on unemployment rates, they note.

The plans provide government funding to companies in order to keep employees on the payroll during times of economic uncertainty. They help families make ends meet and also put less stress on the country's unemployment insurance system.

Additionally, having workers stay connected to their employers can lead to a smoother and stronger recovery, according to the trio.

But there could be some drawbacks to retention programs if they remain in place too long, including higher unemployment and lower economic growth. And, of course, there is also the cost to consider.

Don't hold your breath

It's going to be a long time before we see unemployment fall back to pre-pandemic levels.

In February, the unemployment rate was 3.5%. The Congressional Budget Office said last week that it estimates the rate will remain well above that level until after 2030.

What's more, the 10-year average unemployment rate is projected to be 6.1%, a big increase from the 4.2% rate that was predicted in January, reports CNN Business' Anneken Tappe.

But given that so much is still unknown, including shifts in consumer behavior (what changes will stick and what are temporary?) and even the virus itself (how and when will it go away?) the agency warned the forecast hinges on a lot of uncertainty.

Generation Z's rough entry into working life

Internships. First jobs. Gearing up for college.

For many Gen Z'ers, this was supposed to be a big summer.

But then the pandemic hit. And everyone's plans came to a screeching halt.

The pain of the Covid Recession is widespread, but for the younger generation, the scars are going to run deep.

Members of Gen Z had the potential to narrow the inequality gap in America, writes CNN Business' Jazmin Goodwin. Their earning potential was promising, and the labor market was tight, resulting in companies widening their applicant pools. All good news for young job seekers and closing the economic disparity gap.

Oh what a difference a few months can make.

Now, Gen Z'ers could face a permanent decline in earnings. And Black youth could be hit particularly hard. This group faces higher unemployment and often earns less than their White peers with the same levels of education, reports Goodwin.

And while the current economic climate can be detrimental to all young workers, it's even harder for young Black workers to overcome.

With nearly 18 million people out of work in the US, it's not exactly the best time to be walking away from a job.

But thousands of workers are doing just that.

As sales and revenue streams dry up, some companies are making tough decisions to align their businesses with the current economic reality. For some, that means reducing their workforce through employee buyouts.

The voluntary severance packages differ, but usually include pay and benefits for a set period of time.

At American Airlines, 4,500 employees have agreed to leave the company, mostly for early retirement, reports CNN Business' Chris Isidore. At Boeing, 5,500 have taken buyouts.

And there's likely more coming.

For some workers, accepting a buyout can be a good deal. They might have already been thinking about retirement, considering switching careers, or have another income they can rely on.

Others are taking the buyout now over fears that eventually their departure won't be voluntary.

The ugly truth behind the jobs numbers

We got some good news last week: The economy added 4.8 million jobs in June.

Now here's the (very) bad news: For millions of unemployed people, the jobs they lost aren't coming back -- at least not anytime soon, reports CNN Business' Chris Isidore.

Last month's jobs gain set a record, but the bulk of the people who returned to work had been temporarily laid off from places like factories, stores, hotels, restaurants and bars that have started to reopen.

At the same time, however, 759,000 people were laid off from jobs that won't be coming back, bringing the total to 3.7 million unemployed Americans whose previous jobs are gone for good.

And experts warn this is just the beginning. Read the full story to learn more.

#BlackoutDay2020 is here

Today is #BlackOutDay2020 when many Black Americans vow to not spend any money in order to showcase their economic power.

""We need one day of solidarity in America where not one black person in America spends a dollar. This includes, Africans, Native Americans, Asian-Americans, Hispanics...ALL people of color,"" wrote social media personality and activist Calvin Martyr, on Facebook.

Those who have to buy something today are being encouraged to spend their money at a Black-owned business

The objective is to force politicians and businesses to end institutionally racist policies and practices that have led to the deaths and marginalization of Black Americans, writes CNN Business' Chauncey Alcorn.

The movement could make quite an impact. Black Americans spent more than $1 trillion on consumer goods in 2018, up from $320 billion in 1990, according to Nielsen. And major companies, including Procter & Gamble and Cisco Systems, have expressed support for the initiative on social media.

Kid or job? You gotta pick one

So here's a scenario that is haunting many working parents: Your child's school doesn't open for the upcoming school year. But your employer expects you to come back to the office.

Or here's another nightmare: Your previous childcare provider is no longer available and your employer is requesting you back at work. Or you can't continue to work from home anymore unless you find childcare. Or maybe you can continue working from home, but that means running ragged trying to be a full-time employee, parent and educator all at the same time.

Then what happens?

""In the Covid-19 economy, you're allowed only a kid or a job,"" writes Deb Perelman in the New York Times.

The current situation could force many working parents to make the tough decision to leave their jobs. And even if the break is only temporary, it can have long-term professional and financial impacts.

Yet, writes Perelman, no one is talking about this. Read the full story here.

Attention, Congress

Now that we've established that the situation for working parents is unsustainable, it's time to talk about potential solutions.

The federal government can take some steps now to make parents' lives a little bit easier, reports CNN's Katie Lobosco.

Funding childcare is a big one. Parents need a safe place for the kids while they go to work. But more than four million childcare spots could disappear without federal funding, according to the left-leaning Center for American Progress.

Giving additional funds to K-12 education so schools can safely reopen in the fall, as well as have the necessary equipment and supplies to support virtual learning, would also be a big help.

Jeanne Sahadi,"Today is #BlackoutDay2020 . To demonstrate their economic force with an estimated $1.3 trillion in spending power, Black consumers -- and anyone wishing to support the Black community in its quest for justice against systemic racism and financial inequity -- are encouraged to not spend money today.

Or, if they do, to limit their purchases to companies owned by Black people.

Black-owned small businesses often are more vulnerable financially than others, with smaller cash reserves to survive tough times. And now times couldn't be tougher. In the wake of a pandemic and protests of George Floyd's killing at the hands of police, they are in jeopardy on every front.

Want to help support them? Here are a few ways.

Become a customer

The most obvious and critical way to help Black-owned businesses survive, of course, is to buy their products and services. Shop and eat at Black-owned establishments, and buy gift cards for your friends and family to spend at your favorite ones.

""Now is the time for Americans to demonstrate they really appreciate inclusion. Spend money on less fortunate and disadvantaged businesses, where it can have an immediate impact. Be conscious where you're spending your money,"" said Kenneth Kelly, chairman of the National Bankers Association, a voice for minority banks aiming to help revitalize economies in underserved areas.

Set up a GoFundMe page

set up by the community! I'd suggest others take the initiative to do it because it's soooo hard to ask for money from folks!,"" said owner Sammy McDowell. That's what supporters of the popular Sammy's Avenue Eatery in Minneapolis did. ""We currently have a GoFundMeset up by the community! I'd suggest others take the initiative to do it because it's soooo hard to ask for money from folks!,"" said owner Sammy McDowell.

Spread the word

Let people know why the Black-owned businesses you support are worth their support, too.

""It's an even more important time to post positive reviews of your experience. The mere fact that people are on their phones so much because they're home, that can drive traffic,"" said Apollo Woods, who created OKC Black Eats , a marketing platform to bring attention to Black-owned restaurants and culinary artists in the Oklahoma City area.

Woods believes video testimonials are the most effective because people can both see and hear your enthusiasm.

Call direct

For restaurants that have takeout and delivery, before automatically ordering through a third-party delivery platform like GrubHub or Seamless, try calling the restaurant directly because it will save the business from paying a portion of their sales in fees.

""They may not have a sophisticated ordering system. But every last one will work their hardest to take your order,"" Woods said.

Volunteer your services

If you have critical skills that can be useful to a small business -- for example, if you're an electrician, painter or carpenter, or an accountant or lawyer -- ask the owner if there's some way your services might come in handy.

For businesses that sustained damage during the protests, you might volunteer to help with clean up. Or, for example, if you have a glass business, you might offer a new store front window gratis.

""I grew up in a small town in Oklahoma. Everyone looked out for each other,"" Woods said. ""Have a good heart.""

Take a stand

Why 15%? Black people make up nearly 15% of the population of the United States, according to the most recent Census Bureau estimates.

Provide useful information

Many Black-owned small businesses may be in need of financial lifelines for some time as fallout from coronavirus continues. Let them know of small business grant or loan programs from state or local governments or private organizations.

For instance, the Local Initiatives Support Corp (LISC) has an ongoing small business grant program open to anyone, but the organization has a special interest in supporting minority owners who operate in underserved areas.

Hello Alice, a free online business adviser platform, has earmarked more than $200,000 out of its emergency grant pool to make $10,000 grants to Black-owned businesses. That amount is likely to increase as the company continues to fundraise. Hello Alice also has partnered with Verizon to launch the Black -owned Business Resource Center

Starting in July, online payments platform Finli will offer $500 grants for Black-owned businesses in education and enrichment, such as those offering classes in art, music, yoga, dance or martial arts.

And the National Business League , founded by Booker T. Washington in 1900, has created a digital platform for all Black-owned businesses to find contracting opportunities, funding opportunities and private and public sector clients looking for suppliers. NBL also will launch a global directory of Black-owned businesses that anyone can use.

Both the platform and directory will launch on July 21.",How to help a Black-owned business on #BlackoutDay2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/07/success/blackoutday2020-support-black-owned-businesses/index.html,2020-07-07
David Goldman,"New York (CNN Business) In an interview with Fox News Friday, Goya Foods CEO Robert Unanue said he was ""not apologizing"" for praising President Donald Trump at the White House.

Unanue's appearance at a Rose Garden Thursday ceremony announcing the White House Hispanic Prosperity Initiative sparked outrage on social media. By Friday morning, the hashtag #Goyaway was trending, as prominent Hispanic American leaders called for a boycott of Goya products

On ""Fox & Friends,"" Unanue told co-hosts Steve Doocy, Emily Compagno and Brian Kilmeade that ""it was good to talk to some friends,"" and he called the boycott movement ""suppression of speech.""

He claimed a double standard in the reaction to his laudatory remarks about Trump, noting that he accepted an invitation from Michelle Obama in 2012 to an event in Tampa, Florida, to promote the former first lady's healthy-eating initiative

""You're allowed to talk good or talk praise to one president but you're not -- when I was called to be part of this commission to aid in economic and educational prosperity and you make a positive comment, all the sudden that's not acceptable,"" Unanue told Fox News.

Kerry Flynn,"New York (CNN Business) Sportico CEO Dick Glover thought Labor Day would be the perfect time to launch a new trade publication about the sports business. It's when college football and the NFL seasons are in full swing, as is golf, the US Open and baseball. Hockey and basketball training camps are just getting started.

This was Glover's plan back in February, before the coronavirus pandemic triggered the cancellation of professional sports and other live events. Instead of panicking, however, Glover saw an opportunity and seized it: He decided to fast-track Sportico's launch and bump it up to Fourth of July.

""We saw an incredible thirst for information, a lot of parched mouths so to speak, in the sports world,"" Glover told CNN Business. ""All of the sudden there are no games to report on, no player movements and all of the things that normally make up all of the sports pages. The only thing going on was the business of it.""

The pandemic decimated the the media business which was already struggling, but a handful of niche publications including Sportico are launching during this tumultuous period, giving the media industry a much-needed shot in the arm.

The Oaklandside, Rest of World, The 19th and Discourse Blog, along with Sportico, are among the new publications making their debut during the pandemic. Leaders of these five publications told CNN Business that while the economic fallout from the pandemic has impacted some of their plans, their motivations to create new outlets for journalism have only grown stronger.

Finding coverage gaps

These new publications are focused on what the founders see as topics that don't get enough attention in the mainstream media. For Sportico , that is the business of sports. Sportico owner Penske Media also owns publications dedicated to the film and television business, as well as topics such as music and politics and fashion — but none that cover the sports business.

Rest of World , launched in May, is covering the ways in which technology shapes the ""lives of billions of people beyond the Western bubble,"" CEO and founder Sophie Schmidt told CNN Business in an email.

After living and working outside the US for nearly a decade, Schmidt said she was ""frustrated"" by a lack of reporting on the ""extraordinary — good, bad, weird, wonderful — things"" she saw.

The Oaklandside provides local news for the city of Oakland, California. It officially launched in June as a sister site to Berkeleyside, both under a nonprofit called Cityside, with initial funding from the Google News Initiative.

""My cofounders at Cityside had been hearing for years and years about the enormous need for a similar, in some ways, but totally Oakland-based, Oakland-rooted publication,"" said Tasneem Raja, The Oaklandside editor-in-chief. It secured funding in 2019.

Fast tracking plans

The plan had always been to launch The Oaklandside in June. But Raja told CNN Business that when Bay Area public health officers ordered shelter in place in mid-March , she and news editor Darwin BondGraham did not want to ""sit around and wait.""

The Oakland team started reporting and publishing stories on Berkeleyside even before their own site's unveiling. They also started a COVID-focused newsletter, which now has about 8,200 subscribers.

""The [newsletter's] sign-up rate was remarkable, and the open rate was and has remained remarkable. This is not my first news startup,"" said Raja, who just prior to The Oaklandside co-founded a nonprofit local news startup in East Texas.

The 19th , a non-partisan newsroom covering the intersection of gender, politics and policy, is on track to launch later this summer. But similar to The Oaklandside, the team at The 19th is producing stories ahead of its official launch.

Andrea Valdez, editor in chief of The 19th, said the team had been producing a weekly newsletter. But at the end of March, the cadence moved to twice a week. In addition to a publishing partnership with The Washington Post, The 19th is working with The Philadelphia Inquirer on a series called Portraits of a Pandemic , profiling women in Philadelphia grappling with the pandemic's effects.

""We quickly realized that [what we planned] probably wasn't enough, especially once we realized women would be impacted by the pandemic very acutely,"" Valdez said.

Rest of World, however, chose to delay its launch amid the pandemic. Founder Schmidt said that after closing the company's New York office in early March, two weeks ahead of the planned launch, they pushed the date to May. By that time, Schmidt said she contracted the coronavirus and her executive editor Anup Kaphle had his first child.

""Not only were we suddenly in lockdown, so were all the journalists around the world we work with,"" Schmidt told CNN Business. ""We had to totally rethink how to assign stories, how to keep freelancers safe and how to report tech stories when almost all headlines in every country are focused on public health.""

The job market

""The industry right now is maybe the bleakest it's ever been,"" Chan said. ""Even if we wanted to get another media job anywhere, there aren't any, so we decided maybe the best bet is to invest in ourselves and create our own jobs.""

Discourse Blog started with former Splinter staffers posting stories on a WordPress site. A few weeks later, the team switched to Substack, a newsletter platform that allows for paid subscriptions. All eight founding members are co-owners and will split the revenue evenly.

""We're not the next Dow Jones or anything or Condé Nast 2.0,"" Chan said. ""But maybe we can be this small sustainable thing that eventually supports just us.""

Sportico, The 19th and Rest of World have managed to fill many of their open positions, even as the pandemic forced other news organizations to lay off workers or furlough them. Schmidt said Rest of World's recruiting process actually ""sped up.""

""When we realized that there would be a huge number of new journalism school graduates looking for work, we spun up a paid fellowship program in six weeks and reviewed hundreds of applications,"" Schmidt wrote in an email.

The Oaklandside took a different path and chose to cut back on hiring. While the outlet now has a team of seven, including a Report for America fellow, Raja said she decided to delay hiring for two positions: a public health and environmental impacts reporter and a city hall and policing reporter.

""The pandemic affected our revenue projections, so in March we ripped up our budget and redid our revenue projections,"" Raja said. ""We said the responsible way forward is to continue to grow but grow more slowly than we had originally planned.""

Charting success

Glover of Sportico said the initial success metric he's tracking for his site — which has been live for about a week — will be ""qualitative, not quantitative."" Glover wants to produce sports stories that are read by commissioners, owners and C-level executives — an editorial goal that appears to be aligned with Penske's Hollywood trade publications Variety and Deadline.

Raja of The Oaklandside said her team is tracking success in two ways. First, reporters and editors assign one of the site's founding values to each story before it's published. They plan to analyze that data and share it publicly as a way to hold themselves accountable to the community. Second, they are focused on growing its member base of donors, which reached nearly 600 as of Thursday.

Valdez of The 19th said their goal is to drive the dialogue around women's issues.

""It's bringing conversations to the fore that might be happening in living rooms or between women,"" Valdez said. ""We do very much want people to know who we are and see us as a resource for stories that are important to them.""

On Twitter, Chan of Discourse Blog has been sharing details about the launch of paid subscriptions, which started Monday. Out of the newsletter's 3,642 subscribers, 419 converted to paid subscribers between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. on Monday, which grossed more than $26,000. Chan told CNN Business that as of Thursday, the email list has grown to 4,268 subscribers with 1,010 contributing a total of $63,415.69.

""We're not making huge, huge bucks,"" Chan said. ""But I hope the numbers we're sharing and the progress we've made is compelling to people interested in breaking out of a corporate media job and doing their own thing.""",Here's why these media startups chose to launch while so many other outlets are going under,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/10/media/new-media-companies-pandemic/index.html,2020-07-10
Alexis Benveniste,"New York (CNN Business) Plant-based foods are all the rage right now, and vertical farms are capitalizing on the trend.

Vertical farming is an indoor farming method in which crops are grown in stacked layers, often without soil. The practice is becoming more popular and important as urban populations grow dramatically and available farmland decreases.

While vertical farming isn't a new concept, these eco-friendly indoor farms are now rapidly expanding.

Elon Musk's younger brother, Kimbal Musk , who was named ""Global Social Entrepreneur"" of the year by the World Economic Forum in 2017, started Square Roots, an indoor urban farming company based in Brooklyn, in 2016. Square Roots' mission is to bring fresh, local food to cities around the world by empowering younger generations to participate in urban farming.

""When I was a kid, the only way I could get my family to sit down and connect was by cooking the meal,"" Musk, co-founder and executive chairman of Square Roots, told CNN Business in an email.

Kimbal Musk teaches students how to plant a vegetable garden in California.

""Getting involved with the internet, especially in the late 90's, was very exciting and I wouldn't change anything about those experiences, but my passion has always been food,"" Musk said. ""The moment Elon and I sold Zip2, our first internet company, I knew I wanted to pursue food and become a trained chef."" He moved to New York and enrolled at the International Culinary Center.

Musk said the company plans to open a Square Roots ""Super Farm"" — with 25 climate-controlled shipping containers, cold storage, biosecurity infrastructure and everything else needed to run a vertical farm at scale — in less than three months.

Since its inception, Square Roots has grown more than 120 varieties of crops, including greens, vegetables and strawberries.

The company isn't the first of its kind. Startups like Silicon Valley's Plenty, which was founded in 2013 and is backed by Jeff Bezos, are also beginning to dominate the space.

""Environmentalists, urban farmers, architects, agronomists, and public health experts, among others, have been joining this mini revolution as they partner to work out a way to salvage a food-scarce, ultra-urbanized future,"" Kheir Al-Kodmany, a professor of sustainable urban design at the University of Illinois at Chicago, said in a report.

It involves various techniques, such as hydroponics, which uses mineral nutrient solutions in a water solvent; aquaponics, which uses aquatic creatures -- such as fish and snails -- and cultivates plants in water; and aeroponics, which grows plants in the air.

As for job creation, rapid climate change will put millions of traditional farmers out of business, but vertical farmers won't be affected, according to microbiologist Dickson Despommier, an emeritus professor of public and environmental health at Columbia University.

Although vertical farming was first introduced in the early 1900s, it was recently popularized by Despommier. More than 20 years ago, he began teaching a class at Columbia called Medical Ecology.

Despommier spent a decade growing crops indoors with his students. ""Ten years ago, there were no vertical farms,"" he said, noting that LED grow lights have vastly improved farming efficiency over the last five years, making indoor growing cheaper and more reliable.

Basil growing at the Square Roots farm in Brooklyn.

""People want local food because they've lost trust in the industrial food system that ships in high calorie, low nutrient food from thousands of miles away with little transparency as to who grew the food and how,"" said Peggs, the Square Roots CEO.

At the same time, the world population is growing and urbanizing rapidly. Peggs said climate change is threatening existing supplies of food, forcing the industry to figure out new ways to grow food quickly.

Peggs is optimistic about raising money for vertical farming. ""A lot of smart money and capital is entering the space,"" he said. ""The quality of food that can now be produced in these indoor systems is at least on par with the best organic field grown food you can buy.""

Despommier said that cities will eventually be able to grow ""all they can eat"" from indoor farms located within city limits. ""If an outdoor farm fails, the farmer has to wait until next year to start again, he said. ""Indoor farms fail too, but the indoor farmer can start again within weeks.""",Elon Musk's brother wants to transform farming,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/02/28/business/musk-vertical-farm/index.html,2020-02-28
Hanna Ziady,"London (CNN Business) The United Kingdom made history last year when it became the first major economy to commit to pumping no more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than it removes by 2050.

Dozens of countries have since followed its lead to achieve ""net zero"" emissions, and with three decades to go before the deadline, Britain's progress provides a promising blueprint

Its carbon emissions were 44% below 1990 levels in 2018, with renewable energy now accounting for 33% of its energy mix and coal contributing just over5%. That is thanks in large part to its success with offshore wind and focus on nuclear energy.

But the Committee on Climate Change, an independent advisory body, warns the country must do more to meet its carbon reduction targets for 2023 to 2027. And climate activists say the government should aim for ""net zero"" much sooner than 2050.

Heating homes

By far the biggest threat to the United Kingdom's 2050 ambition comes from the way it heats its homes, schools and hospitals.

More than 80% of homes are connected to the gas grid, according to Ian Radley, head of gas operations at National Grid.

While natural gas emits less carbon than coal, Britain's heavy dependence on the fossil fuel is deemed unsustainable. Heat is responsible for around half of all UK CO2 emissions, according to HyDeploy, a consortium that is currently piloting hydrogen as an alternative to gas.

In other words, the UK government's £1.5 billion ($2 billion) investment into reducing emissions from road transport won't be enough to meet its 2050 target if it doesn't also tackle heating.

""The heating story is the one that usually just gets neglected. It's in the box called 'too difficult,'"" Dieter Helm, professor of energy policy at Oxford University, told CNN Business. ""How are you going to heat your house and do your cooking without natural gas? The answer to that question is at considerable expense.""

A 2018 report commissioned by the National Infrastructure Commission, a government agency, found that decarbonizing Britain's heating infrastructure could cost as much as £450 billion ($586 billion).

The total cost of decarbonization could exceed £1 trillion ($1.3 trillion), according to the Committee on Climate Change.

Among the proposed solutions to the domestic heating challenge: stop connecting new homes to the gas grid, while encouraging existing homeowners to move to energy efficient alternatives such as hydrogen boilers.

Repurposing existing infrastructure will be critical. HyDeploy is conducting experiments at the University of Keele to establish how much hydrogen can be blended into the national grid as a replacement to gas, without people needing to buy new heating or cooking appliances. Hydrogen offers many of the benefits of natural gas, without the carbon emissions.

Production versus consumption

For Helm, even if the United Kingdom achieves its target in terms of power production, consumption is what ultimately matters.

""If we reduce carbon emissions in Britain but simply close down our large industries and import the stuff from China instead, then global warming will be worse off,"" Helm said.

Story Nathaniel Meyersohn,"In the year before Dave Dukes killed a man who was trying to rob the store where he worked, he'd witnessed three other robberies.

After each of them, Dukes, 28, would say later, he'd asked his supervisors at Dollar General to put in a security guard.

But, according to Dukes, his bosses didn't do that — though, because of how many robberies he'd been through, they did start sending him out to train employees at other stores.

After the third robbery, Dukes started bringing a gun to work.

Then, in October 2019, the fourth robbery happened.

According to the local prosecutor's office, a man entered the store with a gun and demanded money from the cashier. When Dukes tried to intervene, the man — Roosevelt Rappley, just 23 years old — pointed his gun at Dukes. Then Dukes pulled out his own gun and shot Rappley, killing him.

A grand jury in Ohio reviewed the case and found Dukes ""acted lawfully under the circumstances,"" according to the prosecutor's office.

But by then Dukes was out of a job, allegedly having been fired by Dollar General for violating company policy. Dollar General's 2019 policy said that possession of a firearm on the company premises may result in termination.

Dave Dukes stands in his lawyer's office in Dayton, Ohio in March. Dukes was a Dollar General clerk who shot and killed a man during an armed robbery. It was the fourth robbery he had witnessed on the job.

Dollar General declined to say why Dukes was terminated, saying in an email that it does not comment publicly on specific employment situations. The company said it does not retaliate ""against employees who make good faith reports of safety concerns."" It also maintains that the safety of its employees is a top priority.

Rappley's family is still trying to process his death eight months after the robbery. Rappley's sister Jasmine Jessery said in an interview that she didn't hold a grudge toward Dukes. ""He was protecting himself,"" she said.

Jessery described her brother as a kind person who had linked up with the wrong crowd. ""Everything went sour"" then, she said.

A thriving business

Business is booming at Dollar General, the chain adding more stores every year than any other retailer in America. That was the case even before the coronavirus pandemic, but Dollar General has been in an even stronger position during the pandemic as price-conscious consumers stock up on essential items.

Former executives, store employees, law enforcement officials and retail security experts told CNN Business that while the company's low-cost, no-frills model might be embraced by Wall Street, it is putting its workers at risk.

Dollar General stores, which process a high number of cash transactions, are a prime target for armed robberies, they said. Some of the former company officials and current and former employees spoke on the condition of anonymity either to discuss internal conversations or for fear that speaking out would impact their jobs.

Dark side of a booming business At a time when other retailers are struggling, Dollar General is thriving. The company plans to add 1,000 stores in 2020.

Meanwhile, insiders and security experts say the company is failing to protect workers from violent crime.

In Dayton, Ohio, seven Dollar General stores accounted for 29% of commercial robberies in 2019. Police say they had repeatedly recommended stores improve security measures.

At least six Dollar General employees have died during robberies since 2016, according to a review of news and police reports.

""Every night I was just waiting for there to be a phone call that said, 'Hey we've lost somebody,'"" Brian Flannery, who oversaw security at around 2,000 Dollar General stores in the northeast as a divisional loss prevention director from 2011 to 2015, said. ""It wasn't a matter there [of] if you were going to have a bad robbery. It was a matter of when.""

At least six Dollar General employees have died during robberies since 2016, according to a review of news and police reports. And while the FBI doesn't specifically track robberies at dollar stores as it does those which occur at convenience stores and gas stations — other robbery targets — police have warned company managers that its stores are vulnerable.

In a statement in response to this story, Dollar General said, ""We employ a number of measures designed to create and maintain a safe work environment for our employees and a safe shopping environment for our customers, all while protecting company assets.""

The company said its safety and security measures take federal and state laws, retail industry standards and law enforcement recommendations into account and its measures are ""designed to prevent, deter and if necessary, respond to criminal activity in our stores.""

""Our employees are our greatest asset. Their safety and security is of paramount importance,"" Dollar General added.

The problem of robberies isn't exclusive to Dollar General. In an interview with CNN Business, Jason Hall, a lieutenant with the Dayton Police Department, described local dollar stores as ""robbery magnets.""

He has tracked robberies at local chains including Dollar Tree, Family Dollar and Dollar General over the last few years — and Dollar General, by far, had the most incidents.

Lieutenant Jason Hall, photographed in March, says the Dayton Police Department repeatedly made security recommendations to dollar stores in the area but many of those recommendations were ignored.

In Dayton alone, police were called to 86 robberies at just seven Dollar General stores between 2016 and 2019. Robberies at Dollar General locations accounted for 29% of the 80 commercial robberies in the city in 2019, according to figures provided by the department.

Dollar General declined to comment on how much it spends annually on crime prevention or any specific measures in its stores to protect workers and prevent robberies ""as to do so potentially compromises the integrity of those measures, provides a roadmap to would-be wrongdoers and may place customers and employees at risk.""

Growing at a price

As other retailers have struggled in recent years, dollar stores have enjoyed breakneck growth. The Great Recession, slow wage growth and widening inequality in America had all boosted discount retailers. Now the pandemic is as well.

The two largest players are Dollar General and Dollar Tree, which bought Family Dollar in 2015.

There are a few differences between the chains. At Dollar Tree, for example, all items are exactly $1 . The stores tend to be in middle-class suburban areas.

Dollar General's more than 16,000 stores, on the other hand, sell items largely in the $1 to $10 range, meaning there is more cash in registers. That makes stores more susceptible to robberies, according to retail security experts.

""We do very good in good times and we do fabulous in bad times,"" Vasos said on a call with Wall Street analysts in May. ""We're very, very bullish on what post-Covid looks like because...I think we're very well positioned no matter what this economy does to both our core customer and to the customer overall.""

We do very good in good times and we do fabulous in bad times."" Todd Vasos, CEO, Dollar General

Investors like Dollar General because it's been relentless at making more with less: less real estate, less labor and smaller product sizes than its larger big-box competitors. In its latest fiscal year, Walmart's US stores had a 5.1% operating profit margin before taxes; Dollar General stores boasted an 8.3% margin — an indicator that Dollar General is more efficient at keeping costs low and turning sales into profits.

Since 2010 , Dollar General's annual profits have increased five-fold and its stock has surged more than 800%. Its locations have nearly doubled, and now the chain boasts more US stores than Walmart, Kroger, Costco and Home Depot combined. A record 25,000 retail stores are expected to close this year, but Dollar General still plans to open 1,000 new locations in 2020 , or roughly 20 new stores a week.

But the company's low-cost approach often comes at the expense of employees, former executives said. Efforts to keep costs down have also kept the company's leadership from wanting to take bigger steps on security, these executives said.

Visibility inside the stores is often poor for workers because of the design, according to law enforcement officials. Stores tend to be small and crowded, with high shelves and piles of boxes and carts lining the aisles. Some police patrolling outside complain that it's difficult to see inside because windows are covered with advertisements and signs.

Dollar General said in an email that ""we continually review and, as needed, adapt operating procedures and store layout [and] fixturing.""

Staffing is intentionally kept at a minimum, often with just one or two low-wage employees on site at any given time, former executives said. And although store registers are often flush with cash because it's what many customers use to pay, security guards are rarely on the premises.

The Dayton Police Department says in 2017 it recommended Dollar General keep its windows clear as a security precaution. This store on Dayton's Salem Avenue, which was the site of four robberies between 2018 and 2020, had its windows covered as of March 2020.

Security guards were viewed as costly to the company's bottom line, the former executives also said.

One former Dollar General executive described the difficulty in convincing other company leaders that security guards could deliver a positive return on investment. ""We certainly didn't get a return having somebody standing there and paying $10 or $12 an hour,"" the former executive said. ""Out of the 13,000 stores when I was there, probably less than 100 stores had some type of outside security.""

Another of the former Dollar General executives, who focused on security, said he was ""heavily chastised"" for frequently going over budget on monthly guard expenses.

Adding staff to stores would have also jeopardized the low-cost model.

""It's a low margin business, so you have to have low labor [costs] to make a profit,"" said one of the former executives. ""Putting more labor in the stores took away from the profit, or you have to raise prices. And there was no appetite to raise prices because it's a low-price business.""

The company has invested in interactive security monitoring services. At thousands of stores in higher-crime neighborhoods or that have experienced frequent incidents, cameras are monitored by offsite security agents. The agents can communicate with employees in the store and make public announcements over the loudspeakers letting customers know they are on camera.

If the agents see a robbery or suspicious activity at the store, they can alert the local police. There are also two-way phones and panic buttons that employees can press to talk directly with a security agent if they are in distress.

Interface Security Systems, one of the services that Dollar General uses, boasts on its website that its technology helps companies reduce security guard costs by 88%. Dollar General also has used iVerify, another off-site monitoring company. Earlier this year, Securitas Electronic Security acquired the customer contracts of iVerify.

This Dollar General store on N Gettysburg Ave in Dayton is where Dave Dukes said he experienced four robberies in just a year on the job.

The remote monitoring systems can be effective at deterring shoplifting inside the store, according to experts. But unlike human security guards who can act as a visible, physical deterrent, they are less effective at deterring robberies, according to police, former employees at iVerify and Interface, and retail security consultants.

One former iVerify executive said, ""it's rare that you're going to be looking at a video when the robbery occurs."" He said the remote monitoring was better-suited for investigating robberies after they occurred.

Securitas, the company that now owns iVerify's customer contracts, did not respond to request for comment. A representative for Interface said ""there is a place for both remote interactive monitoring and security guards in most retail chains"" and that its interactive remote monitoring systems with live video and two-way audio were a strong crime deterrent.

When robberies do occur, some of the former Dollar General executives said, the company offered reactive, short-term measures — such as adding a security guard to a store for a few weeks.

""It was literally whack-a-mole. You would get the okay to spend cash when there was an incident. A reactive security program in that kind of environment is not what you're looking for,"" said Flannery, the former divisional loss prevention director at Dollar General.

Dollar General said it disagreed with Flannery's characterization of its security efforts and that it doesn't believe ""those assertions are supported by facts.""

The safety concerns take a toll on some workers.

When Kenya Slaughter works the cash register at a Dollar General in Alexandria, Louisiana, she makes sure she has enough $1 and $10 bills in the drawer, so she won't have to go back into the safe. When she has to take out money from the safe behind the register, she ""strategically positions herself"" so she's not opening it with her back turned.

Still, potential robbers ""know we don't have security and that people are in there alone,"" she said.

Indeed, Dollar General employees told NBC News in a report last month that they've been stabbed, shot and held at gunpoint.

Significant 'shrink'

In recent years, Dollar General has focused on solving another problem.

Current and former staffers said there was an intense urgency to combat ""shrink"" — or merchandise lost due to shoplifting, employee theft or inventory errors. In its latest annual report filed in March , Dollar General called the problem ""significant,"" noting that ""higher rates of inventory shrinkage or increased security or other costs to combat inventory theft could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.""

The sources said they felt that the company prioritized reducing ""shrink"" over preventing robberies, which had a human toll.

""In the two years I sat in the executive meetings, I never remember anybody bringing up armed robberies as a problem. We talked about loss of product and store manager turnover,"" said one former top Dollar General executive. ""The people that are below the store manager level are just a commodity.""

The obsession with reducing shrink was often turned inward, with Dollar General treating some of its own workers with constant suspicion, said Tracy Vargas, an assistant professor of sociology and criminal justice at the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. Vargas worked as a clerk at Dollar General in 2014 and 2015 for her PhD dissertation on dollar stores at Syracuse University. She also interviewed 50 employees from across the country. In her dissertation, she described workers being treated like criminals with surveillance cameras often focused on their activities rather than on customers.

The people that are below the store manager level are just a commodity."" A former Dollar General executive

Dollar General said its ""understanding is that Ms. Vargas's employment with the company was intended solely to validate her preconceived notions regarding the company for purposes of a book that she was writing, rather than in furtherance of serving the customers and communities that rely on us.""

It added: ""We categorically deny the assertions.""

A 13-foot poster in the store backroom, known as the Shrink Chart, displayed performance statistics including the number of times each employee voided cash register transactions that week, Vargas said. (A large number of voided transactions or price checks could be interpreted by managers as a sign of employee theft.)

Meanwhile, Dollar General provides little training on how to handle robberies, sources told CNN Business.

Former store workers, including Dukes and Vargas, described when they were first hired being shown a simulation video of a robbery. There are no hands-on drills and they did not have to review the video annually, some of these sources said. In some stores, signs are posted in back rooms giving employees directions on what to do ""should the unlikely event of robbery occur.""

Vargas told CNN Business that Dollar General employees are ""sitting ducks"" and ""considered to be profit risks to the corporation's bottom line.""

""Employees are alone, exposed, and at the mercy of whomever [decides] to walk through the door that day,"" she said.

Law enforcement raises concerns

In some cities, local officials have urged Dollar General management to take more steps to prevent violent crime. They say their warnings have largely gone ignored.

Dayton police have prepared reports on crime at local Dollar General, Dollar Tree and Family Dollar stores. On February 1, 2017, members of the department presented a Dollar General divisional loss prevention director with a 32-slide PowerPoint deck detailing the factors the department believes to be ""enabling factors"" in robberies. The factors included blocked windows, high shelves, lack of maintenance outside the stores and lack of security guards in high-incident locations.

It's a ""fairly large issue for us,"" Hall, the Dayton Police Department lieutenant, told CNN Business. ""We've made a lot of recommendations to try to improve these situations. We have noticed that not many of these recommendations have been implemented or fully implemented.""

Dollar General said it ""enjoys frequent communication with the Dayton Police Department"" and that it implemented the department's exterior maintenance suggestions in 2017. The company claimed the department did not provide ""specific store safety and security measures.""

A representative for Dollar Tree, which owns Family Dollar, said ""working with and supporting local law enforcement is absolutely important to us. We continually refine our security program, which includes cooperating with local police departments to share photos and videos to support their investigations.""

In St. Louis, where there have been ""high calls for police service for larcenies, disturbances [and] hold-ups"" at Dollar General and Family Dollar in recent years, ""implementing security is often suggested and ignored,"" said Rich Sykora, an attorney for the city of St. Louis.

Lt. Hall described robberies at local dollar stores as a ""fairly large issue"" in the area. Seven Dollar General locations accounted for 29% of robberies at Dayton businesses in 2019, according to the department's data.

""We will take a fresh look at the St. Louis market and implement the appropriate steps,"" a Dollar Tree representative responded.

In rural Effingham County, Georgia, Sheriff Jimmy McDuffie said three of the five Dollar General stores in the area have been hit in recent years. ""We don't call them dollar stores. We call them stop and robs,"" he said.

McDuffie presented a list of safety concerns to Dollar General stores in the county, he said, including recommendations to improve lighting and limit the number of boxes piled up inside the stores, which can make it difficult for officers to see inside. ""Put in some security measures,"" he urged. ""Light the parking lots up.""

""They say they're going to do better, but it doesn't seem to come to fruition,"" he told CNN Business.

And in the Pee Dee region of South Carolina, there have been a string of robberies at Dollar General stores over the past year.

""None of the stores have added outside cameras that could potentially capture the mode of transportation and the direction of travel for suspects,"" said Tammy Erwin, a deputy at the Marion County Sheriff's Office in South Carolina.

""There are no security officers at any time. There are shifts with only one employee working in the entire store,"" she said. She added that she wonders why Dollar General won't implement ""a buddy-system of employees, so that no one is alone in the store.""

We don't call them dollar stores. We call them stop and robs."" Jimmy McDuffie, Sheriff, Effingham County, Georgia

Dollar General's 2019 handbook of operating procedures says ""at a minimum, two employees must be involved in the closing process. For safety purposes, always use the buddy system."" But there is no mention of similar policy for opening stores in the morning or at other hours of the day. The company says it ""tries to minimize the time that employees are alone in the store.""

The company said it has received ""no formal safety and security policy change"" from the sheriff's offices in Effingham County, Georgia, and Marion County, South Carolina.

Dollar General said it was ""aware of a single request from a member of law enforcement in St. Louis,"" who requested that Dollar General implement facial recognition software from a company ""in which we understood the individual to have a personal and financial interest.""

Deaths on the job

Family members of Dollar General employees killed during armed robberies and security experts say it's not just a lack of in-store security measures that are the problem.

Out of the six Dollar General employees killed since 2016, two were shot as they left stores to deposit cash from the register at the bank.

Some Dollar General employees take cash deposits to the bank by themselves: The company's policy in its 2019 store operating procedures says that stores should make one or two such deposits each day depending on their location, and that the deposits can only be made by ""key carriers,"" or high-ranking employees.

Ron Holder took a job as a store manager at a Dollar General in Richmond, Virginia, and hoped to work his way up the ranks at the company and become a district manager. But he was killed in his car outside of Dollar General one morning after picking up a cash deposit from the store, according to the FBI . His case is still unsolved.

In Houston, 20-year-old DeQuan Anderson was killed in 2017 as he got in his car to bring cash from the store to the bank. His mother, Janine, has filed a wrongful death lawsuit. The case has gone to arbitration.

Janine Anderson described her son in an interview as ""an all-around good kid"" who was active in his church and developed a love of photography in high school. He saved up money to buy a camera and equipment and took it everywhere he went.

""He always was going to have some type of career in art,"" she said. ""That was his passion.""

Before his death, DeQuan had raised concerns about the bank-drop process on multiple occasions, the lawsuit said. But despite previous robberies at the store, Dollar General did not increase its security or hire an outside security company to transport cash to the bank, the lawsuit alleges.

Dollar General declined to comment on pending litigation.

Meanwhile, Dukes, the former Dollar General employee in Dayton, Ohio, is trying to bounce back after the October robbery that changed his life. He has had trouble finding work after the shooting. He is hoping to be more present in his kids' lives.

""I don't regret anything that I did,"" he said. He was defending himself, he said.

But Dukes believes the robbery could have been avoided if Dollar General had taken his advice and put in permanent armed security. He hopes company executives will start doing more to protect their employees.

""They don't know what's going on inside these stores every day. They don't. Store managers are the ones that deal with that every day. But I would tell them that they need to take better care of their staff.""","Dollar General is cheap, popular and spreading across America.

Danielle Wiener-Bronner,"New York (CNN Business) Restaurants are reducing their menus to streamline their operations amid the coronavirus pandemic .

The industry has been hit hard by efforts to stop the spread of Covid-19. From March to May, eating and drinking place sales were $94 billion below expected levels, according to a recent survey by the National Restaurant Association. Reopening will be difficult as well. The slimmer menus are a way to shed complexities and costs, and push simpler or more popular items at a time when conserving cash is crucial for restaurant operators.

Here's what is off the menu

removed dishes like the Sizzlin' Supreme Skillet, Choconana Pancakes, Spicy Sriracha Burger, Fit Slam and Slow-Cooked Pot Roast from its dine-in menu through fall. ""When we realized the effects of the pandemic we quickly mobilized to create a new streamlined menu,"" said John Dillon, Denny's chief brand officer, in a statement emailed to CNN Business. Denny's, which still has plenty of options, is serving items that ""simplify operations and [are] easier to execute for our team members,"" he said.

IHOP used to have a 12-page menu. Now it's giving guests a 2-page, disposable menu. The shift ""required a lot of reductions,"" Brad Haley, IHOP's chief marketing officer, told CNN Business. IHOP held on to popular items that weren't too difficult to prepare. It lost complicated items that fewer guests ordered, and that could be replaced with something similar.

One example: a Simple and Fit omelet made with egg whites and spinach. While the specific dish is no longer on the menu, customers can build their own omelet using the same ingredients. ""We didn't lose any big menu categories, we just trimmed across the board,"" Haley said. A smaller menu makes it easier for IHOP to train new workers as it reopens. It also means less waste for franchise operators, who may throw out unused ingredients they buy for less popular menu items.

""I don't see us going back to the full 12-page menu,"" Haley said.

Dave & Buster's PLAY reduced its 40-item menu to 15 offerings, CEO Brian Jenkins said during a recent analyst call discussing the company's first quarter financial results. ""I do not expect that we will go back to the 40-item menu,"" he said.

McDonald's MCD ""transitioned to a limited menu in April,"" the company said in a statement to CNN Business, adding that ""this decision helped simplify operations for our restaurant crew while also improving our customers' experience.""

planning to this summer bring back a handful of the discontinued items. The chain axed salads, bagels, yogurt parfaits and all-day breakfast during the crisis, the Wall Street Journal reported . The company isplanning to this summer bring back a handful of the discontinued items.

out, restaurants have to reduce their capacities and keep people far enough apart to satisfy social distancing rules. Restaurant operators are in a tough spot. For months, their dining rooms were closed because of local social-distancing orders. Now, as many start to reopen their doors, they face uncertain territory. With unemployment so high , some people may decide that eating out is just too expensive. Others may be afraid to come into restaurants, where they worry they could get sick from staff or other customers . Even if diners are eager to goout, restaurants have to reduce their capacities and keep people far enough apart to satisfy social distancing rules.

Meanwhile, their costs are soaring. Restaurant operators have to pay for personal protective equipment for workers, lots of hand sanitizer, paper towels, contact-free payment systems and more. They may have to pay to redesign their dining rooms . And the cost of some ingredients, like meat , is way up.

Reducing menus could help. And, at least for now, customers don't seem to mind.

The problem with raising prices

Restaurants already operate with very thin margins, so it's difficult for them to absorb costs without making any changes.

One obvious way to cope with higher costs is by passing them on to customers via higher prices. But diners won't stand for it.

""What restaurants really hate is adding fees and doing things that frustrate the customer,"" said Sean Kennedy, the National Restaurant Association's Executive Vice President for Public Affairs.

If customers see prices go up, they may turn to a competitor. Or they might just eat at home.

""There's a lot of options outside of restaurant meals,"" said Tim Powell, a managing principal of Foodservice IP, a foodservice consulting firm. ""If you start raising prices it means that there's a good chance that demand, or the traffic, will go down.""

While some restaurants have reportedly started adding so-called Covid surcharges to bills, US food costs away from home went up just 0.4% from April to May, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Less is more

Shrinking the menu is a better option. It allows restaurants to order ingredients in bulk and achieve better economies of scale. And because restaurants remove their least popular or more expensive items, the changes may impact a relatively small number of customers.

At Dave & Buster's for example, ""the 15 items we selected generate a significant portion of our food revenue,"" CEO Jenkins explained.

Even before the pandemic hit, restaurants would sometimes trim their menus to reduce costs or increase efficiencies. ""We tend to go in and out of those phases,"" said Powell, the food consultant. Last year, McDonald's reduced its late-night menu and abandoned its craft burgers to help speed up its service and make its menus less complex.

And while some customers may miss seeing their favorite dish on the menu, others may be happy with — or at least tolerant of — the changes.

At McDonald's, the newly reduced menu has improved customer satisfaction scores ""significantly,"" said Mark Salebra, chair of the McDonald's National Franchisee Leadership Alliance in a statement provided by a company spokesperson.

Plus, some diners may not care that much about variety right now.

Denny's ""customers have been extremely understanding of the adjustments we've made,"" said Dillon, adding ""we've found our guests are appreciative of the focus we have been putting on safety, cleanliness and sanitation that a slightly smaller menu enables.""

IHOP's Haley put it this way: ""we're not seeing complaints from guests.""",Why restaurant menus are getting shorter,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/23/business/restaurant-menus-shrinking/index.html,2020-06-23

If you're looking to make some cash on clothing resale platforms, check your closet for brands that have the best resale value.

Kristen Rogers,"(CNN) If the year 2020 is good for anything, it's the lesson that during a crisis, anyone who builds a better mousetrap will find the world beating a path to his door.

A humble team at Johns Hopkins University in Maryland reminded the world of late poet Ralph Waldo Emerson's phrase when they created a real time tracking map of coronavirus cases and deaths.

And the world came to their door. They report that the site, plus downloads of its data, hosts three to five billion interactions daily. By their measurement, interactions include uses of the public dashboard and requests from a separate website for the underlying data used by news outlets and others who design their own maps and graphics.

Government agencies, public health departments, the public and news outlets, including CNN , regularly rely onit for the latest updates on the confirmed cases, deaths and recoveries connected to this harrowing disease.

""We were collecting data on a new virus that nobody understood at a time [when] there was not a single web page dedicated to Covid-19 case count,"" said Lauren Gardner, the project's chief and an associate professor in, and codirector of, the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins Whiting School of Engineering.

Professor Lauren Gardner has experience modeling infectious diseases.

From December 2019 to January 2020, Ensheng Dong, Gardner's first-year PhD student, heard from family in China who regularly reported how the outbreak was worsening and upending their lives. After passing an exam that cleared him to earn his PhD, tracking confirmed cases in China was what he wanted to tackle next.

First-year PhD student Ensheng Dong helped create the dashboard in less than a day.

On January 21, over coffee during a weekly research meeting, Dong proposed this idea to Gardner.

His background in spatial data visualization and Gardner's past in modeling infectious diseases converged to create the first iteration of the dashboard — which they finished that night and published the next day. The map's alarming red dots then reflected only 320 reported cases — mostly in China, the rest in Thailand, Japan and South Korea.

""He's gotten to play some pretty major roles in some really central problems to the society for someone that's six months into a degree program,"" Gardner said. ""I keep telling him that he needs to not get used to this and it's not normal. And [that] the rest of his PhD experience is going to be really boring, but I don't think he believes me.""

For two weeks from dawn till dusk, Dong lived and breathed the dashboard; it took precedence over his free time outside of class and soon the classes themselves. With Gardner's blessing, he pushed back a required course until the fall semester.

Has maintaining those responsibilities affected his health in any way? ""Not really,"" he said. ""I think this is what the research should do. The responsibility for this dashboard gives me energy.""

But as cases became globally widespread, they needed help.

""Initially, [I worried about my family]; right now, it's their time to worry about my situation in the US,"" Dong said.

Gardner and her team work to maintain the Covid-19 dashboard, built by her team at Johns Hopkins University.

What was once a modest goal to fill a research gap in a field with antiquated methods for disease tracking is now a tool widely used around the world.

They had no idea ""that it would evolve into something that literally impacts almost everybody's life on the planet,"" Gardner said.

From erratic data to the map on our screens

About 25 people from multiple disciplines now support the dashboard, including graduate students and senior software developers and research scientists primarily based in Maryland, California and England.

Like a lot of people, they're working from home. Their days begin with Zoom calls during which they hash out to-do lists and pressing issues. The conversation continues through a myriad of Slack channels, emails and phone calls.

""It's efficient, but it's boring,"" Gardner said. ""I really miss a bit of the real, in-person world.""

Gardner is in charge, so everyone involved reports to her. Her daily to-do list involves running a research group of PhD students, overseeing data additions and design for the dashboard and making strategic decisions for the development of the dashboard. She spends about half of her time on research based on data from the map.

From dozens of sources including local health departments and data aggregating websites, the dashboard reports cases from more than 3,500 locations — at the province level in China; at the county level in the US; and at subnational and national levels elsewhere.

Because they update the dashboard at least hourly, they've had to shift from manual data collection to leaning more on automatic culling — the team praised data wizards at the university's Applied Physics Laboratory for creating a code that periodically travels to trusted websites and scrapes for data. For independent research and the US government, the APL provides technological systems engineering, development and analysis.

The automated code aggregates the data and publishes it into GitHub , a software development platform. An anomaly detection system reviews every number that comes in and holds back anything that doesn't make sense, explained Ryan Lau, a graduate software engineer in the lab. Sometimes the web sources are technologically unreliable, but the case data is accurate in regard to what has been reported, Gardner said.

The teams manually validate and approve numbers before letting them be processed through a geographic information systems tool into the visualizations we see

Ryan Lau, a graduate software engineer in the university's Applied Physics Laboratory, plays a key role in collecting the data.

""Not to be cliche, but a picture is worth a thousand words,"" Lau said. The APL team works on building and maintaining the automated capabilities of the data-pulling code.

Frequent updates and data from multiple sources is what makes the dashboard different from the World Health Organization's tracker, which counts only states and nations, said Beth Blauer, executive director of the Center for Government Excellence at the university's 21st Century Cities Initiative, a campus hub for research, teaching and outreach that ensures governments think of data as a critical asset for problem-solving.

Blauer's work with the Center for Government Excellence is her day job, but she also began working with the data in March after she used the map to assess the risk of traveling.

She's also a single mom. ""[My kids] deserve some kind of an award for the way that they've been able to stick with me through this,"" Blauer said.

The map places at people's fingertips ""information upon which they can make really important decisions,"" said Jennifer Nuzzo, who works on projects similar to Blauer's, but for the Coronavirus Resource Center. Nuzzo is an associate professor in the university's Bloomberg School of Public Health and a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.

Jennifer Nuzzo, an associate professor in the university's Bloomberg School of Public Health, also contributes to the US dashboard.

""For governments, it's about very high consequence decisions about protecting health and supporting the economy. And for people, it's about how to protect yourself and your loved ones.""

The challenges of informing the world

Work that relays ever-changing information from thousands of places comes with hurdles. There's no international modus operandi for how to count coronavirus infections and deaths.

The dashboard's infrastructure is more stable these days, but the ""sources and information coming in are still changing quite a bit,"" Gardner said.

Stumbling blocks have included when the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggested local health officials switch from reporting only confirmed cases and deaths to also probable cases and deaths

And sometimes the numbers between state and county health departments don't match up — they report differently or at varying times.

Each time these transitions happen, the team has to figure out how to handle them.

The biggest challenge is trying to collect data ""from multiple locations simultaneously and provide it in real time while all of those dynamics are at play,"" Gardner said. Knowing there are so many eyes on it and having to explain it is difficult, too, she added.

The dashboard hasn't been without controversy . The soundness of data aggregating website Worldometer is considered questionable by some academics, but the site is one of many sources from which the JHU dashboard pulls data.

Lessons on human behavior and how a virus travels

Besides the dashboard, the data also supports analyses for the university's Coronavirus Resource Center , which aims to help understanding of the virus and policymaking.

A county's health care capacity and access, demographics and disease data in comparison to its state are three factors starting to reveal those disparities.

Data on testing and contact tracing could illuminate long-term patterns regarding race, socioeconomic status and systemic barriers to testing access — an effort headed by Blauer and Nuzzo.

""There is nothing so stark than looking at the disproportionate amount of Black and Latino people that are [contracting and] dying from this disease, knowing there is no medical safety net for them and also understanding that there are deliberate decisions that aren't taking their best interests in mind,"" Blauer said.

""This is the piece that I think has been the most difficult for me.""

How they're coping during the pandemic

For a long time, Gardner felt removed from reality since busyness left no time for reflection on what was happening around her. Since the dashboard processes have stabilized, she's been able to focus more on the circumstances.

""I would say that I'm probably one of the more frustrated people with the situation, because I am just so well aware of the patterns, the trends, the direction we're going and mistakes we're making,"" she said. ""Watching that happen ... it's extra frustrating.""

Dong frets about his family in China, but the work gets into his subconscious as well. His pandemic-era dreams look like worrying over the quality of the data, which makes him incredibly anxious, he said.

Seeing the contextual reality of the data and thus being able to understand relative risks helps Nuzzo cope with what might otherwise be constant worry. But she also ""can't shut off the pandemic.""

""It's both my job and my life in a way that usually at the end of your workday, you get a break from what you're working on,"" she said. ""We don't escape it at all. That can be just emotionally exhausting.""

What the future holds

The need for this kind of data and analysis isn't going away any time soon, Nuzzo presumed.

""I've been focusing on [pandemic preparedness] for 20 years,"" she said. ""I unfortunately know that we live in an age of epidemics ... We are building an important process and infrastructure that I hope we never have to use again, but data tells me we very well may have to use that again.""

Considering how the dashboard will be used during and after the pandemic has been fruitful.

Philanthropic donations, including from Bloomberg Philanthropies and the Stavros Niarchos Foundation , have been the additional support needed to keep the research train chugging and flexible in regard to what the team can pursue.

""I believe there's a vision of the world in which if outbreaks of a new virus happen, we can also have the public health capabilities to stop the virus in its place, to prevent it from becoming a global pandemic,"" Nuzzo said.

Jay Croft,"(CNN) Another record-setting day of Covid-19 cases across the US came with a spotlight on Florida, which publicly released its number of coronavirus patients currently in the hospital after weeks of pressure to do so.

A total of 6,991 people are hospitalized because of the virus, the state's Agency for Health Care Administration said Friday.

Friday brought 63,900 new Covid-19 cases nationwide, a single-day record, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The new high comes as many states set records in infection rates and hospitalizations

While 29 states saw an increase in new cases compared to last week, Miami-Dade County in Florida on Friday reported a staggering 28% positivity rate, or the percentage of people tested who test positive for the coronavirus.

Mayor Carlos Gimenez's office said the goal is to not exceed a positivity rate of 10%, but the county has exceeded the 18% mark for the past 14 days. On Thursday, it was 33.5%.

Over the past 13 days, hospitalizations in Miami-Dade County have gone up by 74%, the number of beds in intensive care units being used has increased by 88% and the use of ventilators has soared by 123%, according to the latest data from the county government.

""The situation is really concerning here in South Florida,"" Dr. David De La Zerda, the lead ICU physician at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami, told CNN on Friday. ""All the health care workers have a huge burden.""

But Gov. Ron DeSantis said there is no lack of ICU beds in the state

""You've got a lot of beds available,"" DeSantis said at a news conference in Orlando, adding that no major hospital system in the state ""has even gone to like a surge level.""

President Donald Trump traveled to the county on Friday on unrelated business. He was met by five local leaders, including a state senator and Gimenez.

From Miami, Trump traveled to Doral, where he received a briefing at US Southern Command, the US military command that covers the Caribbean and Central and South America. Trump will then go to a church nearby for a roundtable discussion with Venezuelans. After that, Trump will attend a private fundraiser in Hillsboro Beach. He is not scheduled to participate in any events related to the pandemic.

Florida health officials reported 11,433 new Covid-19 cases and 93 deaths, according to data on the Florida Department of Health website.

It's the second time the state's single-day tally topped 11,000, according to CNN's count. The health department reported 11,458 cases on July 4.

California reported 149 coronavirus-related deaths on Thursday, the highest daily total for the state, and total cases topped 300,000 on Friday. California's positivity rate as a 14-day average is climbing and stands at 7.4% with people between the ages of 18-49 accounting for almost 60% of all cases.

After outbreaks and more than two dozen deaths in state prisons, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation announced that 8,000 prisoners will be released early by the end of August.

Texas reported 105 deaths on Thursday, also a 24-hour record for the state, and Gov. Greg Abbott does not anticipate next week will bring any relief.

""I think the numbers are going to look worse as we go into next week, and we need to make sure that there's going to be plenty of hospital beds available in the Houston area,"" Abbott said in an interview with KRIV-TV.

Also setting daily records for new Covid-19 cases were Utah with 850, Louisiana with 2,642 and Georgia with 4,484, health officials said.

Georgia is reactivating a makeshift hospital at the Georgia World Congress Center, a large convention center in downtown Atlanta, amid a rising trend in cases, the governor's office said.

Michigan governor requires face coverings

Following an increase in cases in Michigan, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer signed an executive order requiring a face covering be worn in indoor public spaces. The order requires businesses to refuse service or entry to anyone not wearing a covering, the governor announced in a release.

Violating the order, which goes into effect Monday, could bring a $500 penalty.

There are exceptions, including while people are eating and drinking at a restaurant.

North Carolina set a record Thursday for the highest number of hospitalizations and posted the second highest number of cases for the state, said Gov. Roy Cooper.

""Though North Carolina isn't a surging hot spot like some other states, we could be if we don't stay strong in our fight,"" he said.

Staggering US numbers show pandemic isn't over

According to Johns Hopkins, there are at least 3.18 million cases of coronavirus in the US, and at least 134,059 people have died.

The nation's leading infectious disease expert warned Americans throughout the week that the nation is still ""knee deep"" in the first wave.

""We've never really gotten out of it,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci said in an interview with SiriusXM Doctor Radio airing on Friday. Fauci is the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

Dr. Peter Hotez says he's so alarmed by the rising numbers that he has a hard time sleeping.

""One (reason) is this steep acceleration,"" Hotez, dean of tropical medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, told CNN on Friday morning. ""We're approaching (Fauci's) apocalyptic prediction of 100,000 cases a day.""

Experts say US can stay open -- strategically

While it's impossible to maintain stringent coronavirus restrictions and return to a sense of normalcy, there is a middle ground, Fauci said.

""Rather than think in terms of reverting back down to a complete shutdown, I would think we need to get the states pausing in their opening process. Looking at what did not work well and try to mitigate that,"" Fauci told The Hill's Editor-at-Large Steve Clemons.

The all-or-nothing approach to socialization, and in Florida's case reopening too fast, contributed to the return of the virus, Fauci said on Podcast-19, FiveThirtyEight's weekly podcast on Covid-19.

""There are some governors and mayors that did it perfectly correctly,"" he said. ""But what happened is that many of the citizenry, said, 'You know, well, I'm either going to be locked down or I'm going to let it all rip.'""

Fauci has stressed the risk in congregating, and he recommended Thursday that the nation reevaluate recommendations on when to reopen bars and indoor restaurants, saying they pose one of the ""real problems.""

Even with the restrictions currently in place, only half of Nevada's bars were found to be in compliance, said Gov. Steve Sisolak. As of 11:59 p.m. local time on Friday, bars in certain counties will revert to similar restrictions in Phase 1 of the state's reopening plan.",Florida publicly discloses hospitalizations as the US breaks another case record,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/10/health/us-coronavirus-friday/index.html,2020-07-10
Sandee Lamotte,"(CNN) When New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced last week that malls in New York could not reopen until they installed high-efficiency particulate air filters capable of trapping the virus that causes Covid-19, Harvard environmental health researcher Joseph Gardner Allen was thrilled.

""I've been writing consistently since early February about how healthy buildings should be the first line of defense against the novel coronavirus,"" said Allen, who directs the Healthy Buildings program at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

""I'm really grateful that we have a leader in the country -- somewhere -- who was finally talking about healthy buildings, ventilation and filtration,"" Allen said. ""That hasn't happened before. It just hasn't happened.""

A push to action

Allen was one of 239 scientists who wrote an open letter to the World Health Organization, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other health agencies, asking for a change in their guidance to the public on how the novel coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2, can spread.

Current guidance only focuses on ""hand washing, maintaining social distancing, and droplet precautions,"" according to the letter, published Monday in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases

The health agencies are ignoring the tiny droplets of virus that sputter and spray from our mouths, become aerosolized and then float away into the air, the scientists said, as a likely means of transmission.

""They don't want to talk about airborne transmission because that is going to make people afraid,"" co-author Donald Milton, a professor of environmental health at the University of Maryland, told CNN in a prior interview

""The best vaccine against fear is knowledge and empowering people to take care of themselves,"" Milton said. ""Why wearing a mask is important is because it blocks the aerosols at their source, when it is easy to block them.""

Because the CDC and WHO ""have been so slow to acknowledge aerosol transmission is happening, buildings are not putting in appropriate control measures,"" said Allen, who has focused his career on "" sick buildings "" and how they affect worker performance and productivity.

""The prudent and pragmatic approach is to acknowledge that airborne transmission is happening and put in the controls. If we find out in five years, that airborne was 5% of transmission, then OK,"" Allen said. ""But what if it's 20% or 30% and we failed to acknowledge it? That's a problem.""

Indoor settings such as restaurants, nightclubs and places of worship where people may be shouting, talking or singing and spend long periods of time have been associated with outbreaks, the agency said on its website.

""In these outbreaks, aerosol transmission ... cannot be ruled out. More studies are urgently needed to investigate such instances and assess their significance for transmission of COVID-19.""

Still, ""current evidence suggests that transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurs primarily between people through direct, indirect, or close contact with infected people through infected secretions such as saliva and respiratory secretions, or through their respiratory droplets,"" WHO said.

Not a major transmission route

Currently the CDC says ""Covid-19 is thought to spread mainly through close contact from person-to-person,"" through ""respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks.""

""I subscribe to the CDC opinion that the vast majority of transmission occurs within 3 to 6 feet from the infected person. That's the highway where all the traffic is -- where the the vast majority of this virus is transmitted,"" said infectious disease expert Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville.

""Are there side streets where it can become an aerosol and spread into the air? Yes,"" Schaffner said, adding that isn't likely to create a significant transmission route. If future public health investigations find these ""aerosol transmission events are more common than currently thought,"" that could change priorities.

""But I don't think we need to change all the AC units in the US and around the world based on side street traffic,"" Schaffner added. ""We want to attack the high traffic route by the big three -- masks, social distancing and avoiding large groups. Then we'll get virus transmission down.""

A role for aerosols?

mid-March study found SARS-CoV-2 can survive in microscopic respiratory droplets about 2.5 microns in diameter and smaller, which can remain airborne and viable for up to three hours or more.

Marr, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Virginia Tech, rounded up research focusing on the role of smaller airborne particles in the spread of the novel coronavirus. In early May, Harvard's Allen and LinseyMarr, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Virginia Tech, published a paper thatrounded up research focusing on the role of smaller airborne particles in the spread of the novel coronavirus.

""It is impossible for someone to release 'large droplets' (>5 microns) without also releasing smaller ones. Thus, transmission that is purported to occur via the spray of large droplets from a cough could in fact be occurring through inhalation of much smaller droplets at close range,"" the paper said.

Marr, who made a groundbreaking discovery that flu virus could float in the air in microscopic droplets for an hour or more, likes to use cigarettes as a way to explain how viruses spread.

""The smaller microscopic ones that we call aerosols behave kind of like cigarette smoke. So they're going to be more concentrated closer to the smoker, the person who might be infected. As you get farther away, your exposure would be much less,"" Marr said.

Will masks protect against those microscopic floating droplets? Top-rated N95 and surgical-grade masks will, and scientists are scrambling to study and tweak the effectiveness of homemade masks

""For most cloth face masks, there is no inner filtration layer that traps harmful particles,"" said Sara Greenstein, president and CEO of Lydall, one of the companies who signed with the U.S. Department of Defense to produce filtration media for N95 masks.

""Although wearing a cloth face mask is better than nothing, it is no substitute for an N95 or surgical mask, which are precisely engineered, highly technical products,"" Greenstein said.

Even when medical-grade masks are widespread, ventilation systems with highly effective filters are another key way to filter droplets from the air, Allen said.

MERV ratings

In his edict to New York mall owners, Cuomo was talking about HEPA filters, which have the highest MERV ratings, between 17 and 20.

What's MERV? It stands for ""minimum efficiency reporting value,"" and it's how filters are rated in their ability to trap tiny particles. The MERV ratings go from one to 20: Filters with higher MERV ratings are more effective than filters with lower ratings.

At the highest end, HEPA filters are used by hospitals to create sterile rooms for surgeries and to control infectious diseases, and are able to remove 99.97% of dust, pollen, mold, bacteria and other airborne particles with a size as small as 0.3 microns. For comparison, Covid-19 is thought to be between 0.06 to 1.4 microns.

""Filters are rated at their worst performance, so 99.97% is the worst it will do,"" Allen said. ""And that's rated for a particle size of 0.3 microns, but smaller and larger it actually does better. So the point is that it's capturing nearly all particles.""

Unfortunately, most businesses and home owners may find it difficult to retrofit their existing system to accommodate a HEPA filter, or any filter higher than the rating recommended by the system's manufacturer.

Doing so can actually impair the system's performance: Smaller pores in HEPA air filters make it more difficult for it to push air. Using denser filters can affect the efficiency of the unit and strain the fan, while decreasing indoor air quality -- the opposite of what you desire.

""HEPA filtration is not always going to be feasible or practical,"" Allen said. ""But there are other filters that can do the job. What is recommended now by the standard setting body for HVAC is a MERV 13 filter.""

High-efficiency filters in the 13-to-16 MERV range are often used in hospitals, nursing homes, research labs and other places where filtration is important.

""If you're an owner of a home, building or mall, you want to have someone to assess your system and install the largest MERV number filter the system can reliably handle without dropping the volume of air that runs through it,"" advised Erin Bromage, an associate professor of biology at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth.

""In addition, virtually all modern air conditioning systems in commercial buildings have a process called makeup air where they bring in air from outside and condition it and bring it inside,"" said Bromage, a CNN contributor who wrote a blog post in early May -- "" The Risks -- Know Them -- Avoid Them ,"" that got over 13 million views in one week.

Building owners should be looking at increasing the amount of makeup air that is brought inside by opening dampers, Bromage suggested.

""It's worse in regards to energy, but the more outside air we bring in, the more dilution of the virus we have and then the safer you are,"" Bromage said, adding that it's important to also monitor humidity levels.""

""There's sort of a 'Goldilocks' zone for the coronavirus, between 40 and 60% humidity, where it doesn't survive for very long,"" Bromage said.

Below 40% humidity, he said, the infected droplets hang in the air longer, thus providing the opportunity to travel farther to infect people.

""Above 60%, the droplets lose moisture more slowly, and therefore are heavier and more vulnerable to gravity,"" Bromage said, ""which sounds like a great thing.""

""But it actually drops onto surfaces much faster and being wet actually keeps the virus alive and infectious for longer,"" he added.

What to do?

First, focus on following public health recommendations: Wear masks when you go outside, stay away from large crowds and 6 feet from anyone not in your ""quarantine bubble,"" wash your hands with soap frequently, keep your hands away from your face, and try to only go to outdoor locations with excellent air circulation and filtration.

If you have the resources, there are also personal HEPA air purifiers on the market, designed to clean a standard room of a home. Some even come with humidifiers that will measure the air and keep the room between 40% and 60%, while others incorporate UV light technology designed to kill stray particles.

Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.

""Properly balanced UV light will inactivate viruses and bacteria in the air, which just adds an extra layer to the protection coming from the air purifier,"" Bromage said.

Costs range from a few hundred to over a thousand dollars, but don't be fooled by the price tag: You're looking for a machine with a HEPA filter designed for the size of your room -- so measure carefully. Having too small of a machine in a large room won't clean the air -- while having a large system in a small room is a waste of money.

Finally, know that HEPA filters can be pricey and will need frequent attention to keep them in top performance.

Many point to the cost of filters and the expense of retrofitting buildings and say it may not be worth it. That's not always the case, Allen said.

""It's a total misnomer that healthy building strategies and higher ventilation rates and filtration are expensive strategies,"" Allen said. ""When people know and understand how it's transmitted, then they're empowered to make better decisions.

""And that includes right in your home: You'd have people over, open up those windows; you're in your car with somebody else, roll down the window, a few inches,"" Allen said.

""No one strategy alone is going to work. But if we layer enough of these on top of each other, we can significantly reduce risks.""","Can the AC filter in your home, office or local mall protect you from Covid-19?",https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/07/health/covid-19-air-conditioning-ventilation-wellness-scn/index.html,2020-07-07
Marshall Cohen,"(CNN) A study published Thursday found a significant increase in ""broken heart syndrome"" at two Ohio hospitals among some patients who don't have coronavirus, suggesting that the physical, social and economic stressors from the pandemic are taking a physical toll.

Stress-induced cardiomyopathy or Takotsubo syndrome -- which is often called ""broken heart syndrome"" -- occurs when the heart muscles weaken, leading to chest pain and shortness of breath. It presents like a heart attack, but is triggered by stressful events , not blockages in the bloodstream. It can be deadly in rare cases, but patients usually recover within days or weeks.

Researchers at the Cleveland Clinic studied patients at two hospitals with heart trouble who were treated this spring, and compared them to patients with similar issues over the past two years. Patients during the pandemic were two times likelier to have broken heart syndrome, according to the study, which was published in the medical journal JAMA Network Open

The study looked at 1,914 patients from five distinct two-month periods, including a sample of more than 250 patients hospitalized in March and April, during the early peak of the pandemic. The study concluded that the increase was likely connected to the ""psychological, social, and economic stress"" caused by the pandemic, which includes ""imposed quarantine, lack of social interaction, strict physical distancing rules, and its economic consequences in people's lives.""

""The pandemic has created a parallel environment which is not healthy,"" said Dr. Ankur Kalra, the cardiologist who led the study. ""Emotional distancing is not healthy. The economic impact is not healthy. We've seen that as an increase in non-coronavirus deaths, and our study says that stress cardiomyopathy has gone up because of the stress that the pandemic has created.""

Emma Reynolds,"(CNN) From English cities to the Spanish seaside and Australian housing estates, local lockdowns are cropping up all over the world as countries ease restrictions only to encounter new coronavirus outbreaks.

After months of closures, governments are eager to reopen schools and businesses to allow people to get on with their lives. But fresh clusters of infection have seen leaders forced to reimpose restrictions in some hotspots, even as rules are eased elsewhere in the same country.

Beijing re-entered a partial lockdown in mid-June after a new coronavirus outbreak linked to a food market in the Chinese capital, while at least 24 states in the US are pausing or rolling back their reopenings as cases accelerate, amid fears that earlier restrictions were relaxed too fast.

Spain's northwest region of Galicia ordered a five-day lockdown Sunday for 70,000 inhabitants of A Marina, Lugo Province (pictured), just a day after the region of Catalonia in the northeast ordered the confinement of 200,000 people.

The threshold for imposing new lockdowns as well as their size and scope varies dramatically between countries, from a single building in Italy, to several Rwandan villages, to a community of 200,000 in Spain 's northeast and a coastal area of 70,000 in its northwest, to the whole of Israel.

There are hopes this approach could minimize the economic damage resulting from large-scale shutdowns. In Portugal, for example, 19 boroughs on the outskirts of Lisbon have shut down, while the capital's downtown area has continued its reopening, along with the rest of the country.

Workplace links

The German city of Guetersloh was put back into lockdown after 1,331 workers at its Toennies meat processing factory tested positive for the virus. Germany had few infections elsewhere, and the outbreak caused a sharp rise in the nation's R-number, a value indicating how fast the virus is spreading, according to its center for disease control, the Robert Koch Institute.

Alexander Kekulé, a virology professor and Director of the Institute for Biosecurity Research in Germany, told CNN: ""The only strategy we can have is a stamping-out strategy. It's the same thing we do usually when we have new clusters of infections of any novel disease.""

He said such moves were the ""new normal,"" but needed to be combined with other measures, such as wearing masks and maintaining social distancing, as well as efficient systems to track and trace outbreaks before case numbers enter the hundreds.

A demonstration at a news conference over the outbreak at Toennies meat processing plant in Guetersloh.

Kekulé said this was about clusters, rather than a second wave

""We should get used to it,"" he added. ""In many places of the world people are really used to rules, for instance: Mosquito nets. And you can argue that the mosquito net is terrible and will change your whole life -- and it's like everybody argues against masks -- but when you have at the other side a deadly disease, and no real good idea how to survive until the vaccine will come, one day or never, then I think it's the best chance we have.""

Guetersloh's lockdown was lifted Monday when a court in the state of North Rhine-Westfalia ruled that the regulation was ""no longer compatible with the principle of proportionality and the principle of equal treatment.""

Residents reported facing prejudice from the rest of the country, with a T-shirt on sale reading, ""Keep a distance, I am from Guetersloh,"" and CNN affiliate n-tv reporting that people with Guetersloh license plates were worried about driving outside the district for fear of discrimination.

In the Italian city of Mondragone, authorities sealed off a building that housed migrant seasonal workers as a ""red zone"" late last month after 49 people tested positive for Covid-19. The army was sent to monitor the hotspot and a group of workers living in the building broke the quarantine to protest.

The governor of the Campania region, Vincenzo De Luca, blamed foreign workers for the ""contagion,"" in an interview published on his Twitter account: ""As always, we worked to assure the serenity of our families. In the coming weeks I believe we will do a wide check on seasonal workers.""

A spokesperson for the Italian Interior Minister told CNN that military controls were ending Tuesday night with only 10 positive cases remaining in the building, which they said local health authorities could easily monitor.

And in Serbia, police in the capital Belgrade on Tuesday fired tear gas at protesters demonstrating against the President Aleksandar Vucic after he announced a weekend-long curfew to try to combat a surge in cases.

On Tuesday, Serbia recorded its highest daily death toll from Covid-19 since the start of the pandemic, with Vucic calling the situation in Belgrade ""alarming.""

Lockdown towns

The English city of Leicester returned to lockdown for two weeks from July 2, with non-essential businesses shutting, people advised to minimize social contact, and schools closed for most children, after a spike in cases there.

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned that Leicester showed ""the virus is out there still circling like a shark in the water,"" raising fears of further lockdowns in other UK areas with rising numbers of new cases. After UK pubs opened last weekend, three establishments announced they were shutting because customers had tested positive for the coronavirus.

Leicester couple Naeem and Aisha Brisco formed an organization called Project Hope with two friends, to deliver food and necessities to vulnerable people in the community.

Naeem Brisco, whose IT company is currently closed, told CNN more people seemed to be struggling financially this time around. ""I have noticed that there's been more calls coming through,"" he said.

Signs explaining social distancing on display during the second lockdown in the English city of Leicester.

He said there were now more test centers, boards displaying distancing rules, leaflets delivered to people's homes in different languages, and police patrolling streets and stopping cars.

With the rest of the country able to visit relatives and return to pubs after England's lockdown was eased on July 4, ""Leicester feels a bit left out,"" he said.

Brisco said support was coming from the grassroots. ""I think mainly the locals are getting together and just trying to be there for their neighbors and family.""

The charity Save the Children says more than 25,000 children live in poverty in Leicester; it has warned that deprivation could soar during the new lockdown.

Campaign group Labour Behind the Label last week suggested conditions in Leicester's garment factories were increasing the risk of coronavirus transmission among low-paid and often migrant workers.

But Brisco stressed it was important not to stereotype areas. ""I can see a lot of unity and we talk about ethnic minorities, I get that, but if we remember, we've got people of all backgrounds in Leicester. Certain words that we use can put people in a minority position.""

He said people were ""scared"" but happy to do what needed to be done to contain the spread of the virus.

As for businesses: ""How long they can sustain for, I don't know,"" he said.

Sharifah Sekalala, Associate Professor at Warwick Law School, told CNN it was ""a real concern"" that local lockdowns could mean ""communities that are already deprived might then get deprived even further.""

She said the onus should not be on people who work in factories, use public transport, live in crowded housing or face social deprivation to enforce social distancing.

""What you end up with is just really easily stigmatizing all of certain groups of people,"" she said. ""This is really problematic, in terms of class but also in terms of ethnic groups that certain groups are going to be disproportionately more affected.""

Sekalala said government should hold industries to account -- as when the French government took Amazon to court for not practicing social distancing -- and ""think really carefully about what a social safety net looks like in times of a crisis.""

This includes providing appropriate housing that is not as densely populated, making sure transport to workplaces is socially distanced, and ensuring people can sustain themselves in the long term -- not just receiving furlough payments before losing their job.

Sekalala said lockdowns should not be ""punitive"" towards a particular region. ""We need to shift the narrative about this localized lockdown, because it seems to me that the people who are locking down make a personal sacrifice on behalf of the whole country,"" she said.

Second state of emergency

In the Australian state of Victoria , 6.6 million people have been isolated from the rest of the country for six weeks after Melbourne saw a record rise in daily case numbers.

On Saturday, 3,000 residents of nine densely populated public housing estates were put under full lockdown and from Wednesday, residents in metropolitan Melbourne are no longer allowed to leave their homes, except for grocery shopping, caregiving, exercise or work.

Victoria's border with New South Wales will close for the first time since the pandemic began.

Police stop and question drivers at a checkpoint on July 8 in the Australian border town of Albury.

""We know we're on the cusp of something very, very bad if we don't get on top of this,"" Victoria's State Premier Daniel Andrews told reporters Tuesday, describing the surge in numbers as unsustainable.

""I think a sense of complacency has crept into us as we let our frustrations get the better of us,"" Andrews said.

Melbourne cafe owner Steffan Tissa told CNN that he switched to takeout service for around three months before reopening to dine-in customers recently. Now his cafe, West 48, is closing its doors again. Tissa said he understands it's a necessity, but it will be ""difficult"" for his business.

""When it first started, we had to let staff go,"" he said. ""And then as the lockdown started to ease off, we brought new staff on.

""We've been quite encouraged by it and now to have to go back, we're in a state of limbo, you know, where will our new normal be just in terms of how trade goes?"" he said. ""Financially, it could be quite a challenge.""

Large-scale second lockdowns

Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, warned on Tuesday that the US is "" still knee-deep in the first wave"" of coronavirus, and seeing ""a resurgence of infections"" after never really reducing them to a safe level in the first place.

California and Florida closed beaches over the holiday weekend. Colorado is closing bars for July. Arizona has shut bars, gyms, and other businesses for a month.

New York, New Jersey and Connecticut are asking people from 16 states to self-quarantine upon arrival, while Massachusetts is doing the same for all bar seven northeastern states.

Israel has re-imposed strict limitations across the whole country, closing event halls, bars, gyms and pools after the country hit a record daily figure of 1,140 new infections.

It is facing a near 40-fold increase in daily cases from mid-May, when the nation appeared to have the virus under control.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a cabinet meeting Monday that ""we must take immediate steps that will prevent us from having to take even more extreme measures later.""

But Kekulé, the virology professor, believes that large-scale reopening and then locking down again is a mistake, and risks causing psychological or economic damage to those affected.

""We need a reliable picture of our future or the economy,"" he told CNN. ""You cannot plan when you have the possibilities of lockdowns at any time. People will not do that several times, again and again.

""In the United States, or also in Brazil, we have the situation that the people are beginning to fight against lockdowns and I understand why they are doing that,"" he said.

""Instead of braking and accelerating, we needed a completely different concept... some kind of continuous response to the disease or to the outbreak.

""Whenever we loosen these lockdowns without having a replacement strategy you will get outbreaks again, because you have only very few people who are immune.""

Madeline Holcombe,"(CNN) The gains the people of Louisiana made against Covid-19 in June have been wiped out over the past three weeks, Gov. John Bel Edwards said Wednesday.

""We have a statewide pandemic. It's no longer one or two regions,"" Edwards told reporters in Baton Rouge.

Edwards' announcement comes as the United States passed 3 million coronavirus cases.

Louisiana's health department reported 1,891 new cases Wednesday, 95% of which are from community spread, according to Edwards. Data from Johns Hopkins University shows the moving seven-day average of cases in the state hasn't been this high since early April.

Some hospitals are running out of ICU capacity

In Florida, 42 hospitals on Wednesday had no more capacity in their intensive care units -- down from 56 a day earlier -- and others are running low, but the state Agency for Health Care Administration said, ""Hospitals have the ability to convert beds and bring additional ICU beds online in a surge situation when necessary.""

Dr. Nicholas Namias, the medical director at the trauma center at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami, told CNN's ""The Lead with Jake Tapper"" that it is a balancing act between trying to have isolation bed capacity and treating other patients who need routine care.

""Right now we're not looking at anything apocalyptic going on in the hospital but we are flirting every day with the edge of capacity,"" he said.

He said some of the Covid patients are young people who are on ventilators.

In Arizona, the state has set records for daily death counts about once a week, including Tuesday -- the same day the state reported its lowest-ever number of ICU beds available.

""We need medical professionals. We need testing kits. We need supplies immediately,"" Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego said Tuesday. ""Our hospital is already in dire straits, and they tell us in the next two weeks it is going to get to an unbearable level of crisis.""

On Georgia's coronavirus website, the Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency says 18% of critical care hospital beds remain available and 17% of inpatient beds are available statewide. The figures are several percentage points lower than a week ago.

The pandemic worsens

The first reported case of Covid-19 came on January 21. Within 99 days, 1 million Americans became infected.

It took just 43 days after that to reach 2 million cases.

And 28 days later, on Wednesday, the US reached 3 million cases of the novel coronavirus.

The ferocious speed at which Covid-19 spreads has astounded doctors, with more than 132,000 people dying from the disease since January, according to data from Johns Hopkins University

The rate of new cases is increasing in 35 states, threatening to reverse the progress made during weeks of stressful shutdowns and stay-at-home orders.

The United States must control crowds, get people wearing masks and do a better job on physical distancing to get on top of the surging coronavirus pandemic as cases spike across parts of the South and Southwest, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's leading infectious disease expert, said Wednesday.

""We've got to get our arms around this,"" Fauci told the Wall Street Journal in a new podcast. ""We've got to be stringent.""

Dr. Boris Lushniak, a past deputy US surgeon general, told CNN governments should adhere to the White House plan for reopening that was announced in April.

""The key feature of the plan was if the numbers don't look good, if certain areas are still being affected, there is this mandate within that plan to roll back, to go back and be able to reassess what we're doing from a public health measures perspective to prevent further disease, to prevent further deaths and to stop this spread of Covid-19,"" he told Wolf Blitzer. ""The plan is there, let's follow it.""

'Wear a mask, period.'

As of Monday, 35 states plus Washington, DC, and Puerto Rico had implemented some type of mask requirement. Fauci is ""strongly in favor"" of the mandates to curb the spread, he said.

""When you look at what we can do that we know works, it's the use of masks, physical distance and avoiding crowds,"" Fauci said Tuesday. ""So, if you're saying it doesn't matter whether you put it on or take it off, you're giving a wrong, mixed signal. The signal should be: Wear a mask, period.""

If most Americans heed the directive, as many as 45,000 fewer Americans will die of coronavirus this fall, according to Dr. Chris Murray, the director of the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.

The latest model, released Tuesday, projects as many as 208,000 coronavirus deaths by November 1.

The new death rate stems from the recent surge in cases combined with seasonality and schools reopening, Murray said.

The number drops to 163,000 if most Americans wear a face mask, according to the model.

""It's an incredibly simple strategy and intervention,"" Murray said. ""It's one that will save lives, but it will also help the economy enormously because it will avoid shutdowns which will inevitably come when things get quickly out of control in some states.""

Some college students may return in fall

Colleges and universities across the country are navigating how to safely reopen and keep students in the classroom come fall.

New York University has implemented mask and social distancing measures for the next semester. Caps will be placed on enrollment and space capacity, and classroom occupancy will be reduced by 50%, according to an email from NYU leadership to the community.

As of July 15, all students, faculty and visitors at the University System of Georgia will also be mandated to wear masks, USG announced on its website.

Though Columbia University announced undergraduates and students of Columbia College and the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science will return in the fall, only 60% will be welcomed back. Most classes will still be taught in remote or hybrid form.

Brown University will shift its calendar and add a summer term to accommodate more students on campus at separate times, according to a letter to students from university President Christina Paxson.

The university will also offer virtual learning courses to all students, regardless of whether they are living on campus, and all classes with more than 20 students will be conducted remotely.

Advocates of higher education asked Congress on Tuesday to approve federal aid to help colleges and universities avoid budget cuts in the upcoming academic year.

""Higher education is a public good that benefits the entirety of our nation and our nation's position in a global economy,"" said Shaun Harper, president of the American Educational Research Association.

""Therefore, federal investment into higher education is really an investment into the economic security, the homeland security and the viability of the United States.""",Louisiana governor says progress against coronavirus has been wiped out in past three weeks,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/08/health/us-coronavirus-wednesday/index.html,2020-07-08
Nicole Chavez,"(CNN) The worsening coronavirus pandemic hit a series of somber peaks across the United States on Tuesday, renewing fears that more hospitals could be overloaded with Covid-19 patients.

At least 56 intensive care units in Florida hospitals reached capacity on Tuesday, state officials said. Another 35 hospitals show ICU bed availability of 10% or less, according to the Agency for Health Care Administration in that state.

Georgia surpassed 100,000 reported coronavirus cases, becoming the ninth state to pass the mark.

In California, the number of hospitalizations across the state were at an all-time high and the virus positivity rate jumped more than 2% in Los Angeles.

As nearly 3 million confirmed coronavirus cases were reported in the US, the need for testing has increased. That has led federal officials to set up new testing sites in Florida, Louisiana and Texas. But major diagnostic companies have said they are facing testing delays.

Hospitals in Texas and Florida are flooded with critical Covid-19 patients and some local and state officials have made face coverings mandatory.

Last week, the country averaged just under 50,000 new cases daily -- the highest rate recorded, and twice as high as a month ago.

Texas reported more than 10,000 new cases on Tuesday, marking the highest single day total in the state since the pandemic began.

Dr. Anthony Fauci , the nation's top infectious disease expert, said Tuesday the death rate among coronavirus patients has lowered but Americans shouldn't take comfort in it.

""It's a false narrative to take comfort in a lower rate of death,"" Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said during a livestream with Sen. Doug Jones of Alabama. ""There's so many other things that are very dangerous and bad about this virus, don't get yourself into false complacency.""

More than 131,200 people in the US have died from coronavirus, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

An influential coronavirus model often cited by the White House increased its projections for US deaths on Tuesday and it's now forecasting more than 208,000 deaths by November.

But face masks could save as many as 45,000 US lives by November if 95% of the population wears a covering in public, according to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington, which built the model.

""It's an incredibly simple strategy and intervention,"" Chris Murray, director of the IHME, told CNN. ""It's one that will save lives, but it will also help the economy enormously because it will avoid shutdowns which will inevitably come when things get quickly out of control in some states.""

California hospitalizations at all-time high

Nearly 6,000 coronavirus patients are hospitalized in California -- the highest number since the pandemic began -- and the state is seeing a record number of Covid-19 patients in ICUs, according to data from California Department of Public Health.

California is only one of several states that are reporting record numbers of hospitalizations. Medical facilities in Florida, Texas, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina are being overrun by the surge of cases.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced Tuesday that officials are sending 100 nurses and adding nearly 50 beds to Miami's Jackson Memorial Hospital. The facility has 345 Covid-19 patients with 25% of them in the ICU, the governor said.

In Florida, at least 43 hospitals across 21 counties -- including Miami-Dade, Broward, Hillsborough and Orange counties -- have hit capacity and show zero ICU beds available, according to data released by the Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA).

In Texas, Houston's United Memorial Medical Center is seeing a rising number of patients that need a ventilator, chief medical officer Dr. Joseph Varon said Tuesday.

Medical staff there are ""putting in anywhere between 16 to 20 hours a day,"" Varon told CNN.

Lina Hidalgo, judge of Texas' Harris County, which includes Houston, is wants a stay-at-home order in her county as coronavirus cases rise. A patchwork method, she said, won't quell the virus in the long run.

""A long-term solution based on data instead of wishful thinking is what's going to put our economy in the position to succeed,"" Hidalgo told CNN's Kate Bolduan on Tuesday.

In Texas' Rio Grande Valley, a hospital in the city of Weslaco set up tent outside to help deal with an influx of Covid-19 patients, CNN affiliate KVEO reported

The 25-foot tent is meant to help South Texas Health System emergency room doctors treat and additional 20 coronavirus patients, adding to the 14 that the facility could otherwise handle.

""We are trying to reserve out in-house ER for the sicker patients,"" hospital director Pablo Laredo told KVEO on Monday.

Michigan governor calls for 'mask-up campaign'

At least 31 states have showed an upward trend in average new daily cases -- an increase of at least 10% -- over the last seven days, as of Tuesday morning, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

Those states are: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, California, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, New Jersey, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Washington state, West Virginia and Wisconsin.

Only four states have seen average daily cases decline more than 10% over those seven days: Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Rhode Island.

One of the main drivers of cases now could be ""silent spreaders,"" or people who are asymptomatic or presymptomatic, according to a new study.

The report, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found that asymptomatic or presymptomatic hosts could be responsible for half of cases.

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Tuesday called for a ""national mask-up campaign,"" saying it is necessary for everyone to wear masks to stem the spread of the coronavirus.

""I think that if everyone endorsed this, it's a simple, cost-effective thing that we could do to really mitigate spread,"" Whitmer told CNN's ""New Day.""

After weeks of health officials encouraging the public to wear face masks, at least 35 states along with Washington DC and Puerto Rico have implemented face covering requirements to help mitigate the virus' spread.

US commits $1.6 billion to Covid-19 vaccine maker Novavax

The US government has announced it's giving the largest government Covid-19 vaccine contract to date, as a race to find and deliver an effective vaccine continues.

Operation Warp Speed, the federal government's Covid-19 vaccine program, on Tuesday announced a $1.6 billion contract with Novavax, a Maryland biotech company.

Novavax is the fourth company to receive federal funds to conduct large-scale Phase 3 clinical trials and manufacture its Covid-19 vaccine. Each trial is expected to include 30,000 people.

Novavax's $1.6 billion will allow the company to test the vaccine and scale up production in advance of its possible approval, with the aim of delivering 100 million doses by February, Stanley Erck, Novavax's president and CEO, told CNN.",56 Florida hospital ICUs have hit capacity,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/07/health/us-coronavirus-tuesday/index.html,2020-07-07
Angus Watson,"Albury, Australia (CNN) As Australia shuts the border between its two most populous states to contain the spread of the coronavirus, tens of thousands of people living close to the dividing line have found their community cleaved in two.

Located on each side of the Murray river that separates New South Wales (NSW) and Victoria, the twin cities of Albury and Wodonga, more commonly referred to as Albury-Wodonga, have long operated as one community and one economy.

Many of their 100,000 residents cross the border to travel to work and school everyday. Businesses run on both sides of the river. The two cities even share the same hospital, located in Albury on the NSW side but covered by Victoria's health system.

But that border was sealed on Wednesday, as authorities scrambled to prevent a second wave of infections spreading across the country. Over the past few weeks, Victoria has struggled to contain a sudden reemergence of coronavirus in Melbourne, as case numbers have continued to rise.

Authorities blocked major roads between Victoria and NSW after midnight -- the first time in 100 years since the border was last closed during the Spanish flu pandemic.

People from Victoria are banned from entering NSW, but exemptions are made for some purposes and professions, including cross-border residents in settlements like Albury-Wodonga.

Online applications for cross-border permits started on Tuesday night, but the website crashed just 45 minutes after launching as 44,000 people applied, according to Australian national broadcaster ABC.

There are 55 ground crossings between Victoria and NSW, on a border that stretches over 1,000 kilometers (621.3 miles). Albury-Wodonga lies on the busiest crossings of them all -- and on the biggest freight route in Australia, raising concerns about the potential economic damage to the region.

A sign of no entry is displayed in the New South Wales, Victoria border town of Albury on July 7.

""Complete frustration and chaos""

On early Wednesday morning, traffic stretched for miles at the border checkpoint on Lincoln Causeway, a major thoroughfare connecting Albury and Wodonga, as police officers scrutinized each car making the crossing.

It took some Wodonga residents -- from the Victoria side of the border -- 50 minutes to get through the checkpoint at 6 a.m. to go to work in Albury, said Wodonga Mayor Anna Speedie, who called the situation ""unacceptable.""

""Unfortunately today did start off as we expected with complete frustration and chaos,"" Speedie told reporters next to the checkpoint.

""By 7.30 a.m., we had a traffic banked out to the middle of my city, right to the heart of the city,"" she said.

Police stop and question drivers at a checkpoint on July 8 in Albury, Australia.

Speedies said her government would continue to work with the NSW police to put in place some more practical approaches.

""We have to do better, we absolutely need to find solutions because this is absolutely unattainable for our community.""

Albury Mayor Kevin Mack said three people from Melbourne had been caught trying to drive across the state border into Albury since 2 a.m., Wednesday. They were turned back by the police, he said.

This week, Albury recorded two new coronavirus cases for the first time in weeks. A resident returning from Melbourne contracted the virus and passed it to a family member, according to local health authorities.

Bikram Gujral, a truck driver waiting in line at the checkpoint, said he understood the strict border restrictions that have been put in place.

""Obviously it's frustrating for anyone. But whatever the government is doing is for the benefit of us anyway, so I feel like it's the right thing to do if it's in the favor of us being safe,"" he said.

Separated by the border

But for some, the border closure may cost them their last chance to see their loved one.

April Smithers, 29, is being treated for terminal bone cancer at the Albury Wodonga Regional Cancer Center in Albury, on the NSW side of the border.

She and her husband Chris Carter live in Wodonga, on the Victoria side.

""Our home is in Victoria. We cross into New South Wales almost every day to come to this hospital. With the border closure...I'm gonna stay here. Luckily the hospital gave me a bed last night,"" Carter said.

April Smithers (left) is being treated for bone cancer in Albury in New South Wales. She and her husband Chris Carter (right) live in Wodonga, across the state border in Victoria.

But Carter's parents, who had traveled from Canberra to Wodonga to see the couple, can't cross into the NSW side, he said.

""My parents have come down to help me and April to go through all of this,"" Carter said. ""But now they're not residents, they don't have medical treatment themselves to go to New South Wales...They can't see April until we figure out how they get their pass.""

The reemergence of the virus points to the difficulties faced by authorities the world over, as they attempt to reopen cities following protracted lockdowns. Australia has been heralded as among the world's most successful countries in tackling and containing the virus, shutting down its border and restricting international travel early.

But weeks after states in Australia eased social-distancing restrictions, a fresh outbreak resurfaced in Melbourne last month. On Tuesday, Victoria State Premier Daniel Andrews announced Melbourne will return to a six-week lockdown starting from midnight Wednesday.

Residents in the second largest Australian city will no longer be allowed to leave their homes unless it's for grocery shopping, caregiving, exercise or work. Cafes and restaurants that were allowed to reopen weeks ago will return to take away and delivery only.

Michelle Toh,"Hong Kong/Sydney (CNN Business) Qantas (QABSY) is cutting 6,000 jobs and looking to raise up to 1.9 billion Australian dollars ($1.3 billion) as the carrier fights to survive the coronavirus pandemic.

The cuts announced Thursday account for 20% of Qantas' total workforce of 29,000 people, according to the company. They will primarily affect the airline's corporate, ground and flight staff, while another 15,000 workers will remain on furlough ""until flying returns,"" it added. Jetstar, the company's budget carrier, will also be affected.

Boeing BA The airline is also making drastic changes to its fleet as part of a broader, three-year plan to help its business recover from the historic slump in global travel . Most of the carrier's international aircraft — or up to 100 planes — will stay grounded for a year, the company said. Its six747 jumbo jets are also being retired six months ahead of schedule.

The new measures are expected to help the company lower costs by 15 billion Australian dollars ($10 billion) over three years. After that, it's targeting 1 billion Australian dollars (roughly $686,000) in recurring savings each year.

Qantas shares, which have fallen 41% this year, were halted from trading in Sydney on Thursday as it made the announcement. Its fundraising plan will involve offering an additional 1.36 billion Australian dollars (about $933,000) worth of shares to institutional investors, at about a 13% discount to the stock's closing price Wednesday.","Qantas is cutting 6,000 jobs and raising $1.3 billion to survive the pandemic",https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/25/business/qantas-airways-job-cuts-intl-hnk/index.html,2020-06-25
Hilary Whiteman,"Brisbane, Australia (CNN) Every day, the men unfurl large pleas for help over the balcony railings of their hotel room and stand in silence as traffic roars along the main road of the Australian city they're trapped in.

Their signs are mostly made from bin bags stuck together with tape, and secured to the railing with shoelaces.

""Where is justice?"" one reads.

These men are not hotel guests, but refugees and asylum seekers who have been in Australian immigration custody for seven years. Many arrived in Australian waters in 2013, after the government introduced offshore immigration processing. They were detained on the remote islands of Manus in Papua New Guinea (PNG) and on Nauru in the Pacific, in conditions once described by the United Nations as "" harsh"" and ""inadequate ."" In 2016, Amnesty International called Nauru an ""open-air prison.""

All are suffering the effects of prolonged, indefinite detention and were brought to Australia last year for urgent medical treatment.

But some say the conditions in the Brisbane hotel are worse than PNG or Nauru.

""You're in prison in here. In PNG, you have a little bit of freedom. You can move around. There is no ABF (Australian Border Force), no security guards around you,"" said Farhad Rahmati, an Iranian refugee who was transferred to Australia from PNG last July.

For months, the 120 or so men inside the hotel kept quiet about their plight. However that changed in March, when the number of coronavirus cases in Brisbane started rising. Fearing the virus would enter the hotel via the guards who come and go, they crafted signs large enough to be seen from the street.

As people noticed their pleas, weekly demonstrations began outside the hotel. These demonstrations have now escalated into a blockade by human rights activists who are demanding the men be freed.

The standoff between cellphone-armed protesters and security guards has cast unwanted attention on an Australian immigration policy that has long been, by definition, focused offshore.

Now it's playing out in the heart of one of Australia's largest cities in a 4.5-star hotel that only a few months ago was still accepting paying guests.

Protesters staged weekly protests that escalated into an occupation when security guards tried to remove a detainee.

Offshore detention

In 2018, it was reported that Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison had a model migrant boat on his desk bearing the words: ""I stopped these.""

Before taking high office, Morrison helped strengthen the country's border protection policies, which mandate that people arriving by boat will be processed offshore -- and even if they are found to be refugees, they will never be settled in Australia.

The government says this policy removes demand for people smugglers and prevents deaths at sea. Boat arrivals peaked in 2012, when more than 17,000 passengers arrived from Iran, Afghanistan, Myanmar and other troubled nations, via hubs such as Indonesia and Malaysia.

Few boats arrive now, but human rights advocates say the policy has created a cohort of prisoners confined to islands offshore. As the detainees' mental health deteriorated, advocates pushed for a law to allow doctors to decide if they should be brought to Australia for medical treatment. The medevac bill was passed in March 2019, opening the door for transfers, but the government abruptly closed it again after winning an election that May, citing national security concerns.

Before that happened, almost 200 men had been brought to Australia under the medevac law, including some who were suicidal. Others had brain injuries, undiagnosed gastrointestinal bleeding, heart conditions and broken bones that needed surgery.

For months, many of those detainees lived in one of the Brisbane hotel's three buildings, confined to the upper floors -- and beyond the view of paying guests. Before the coronavirus outbreak, they were allowed visits from pre-approved guests. Now, they're only allowed out for medical appointments, escorted by guards.

In March, due to the pandemic, more space was needed for social distancing in Brisbane Immigration Transit Accommodation (BITA), the main immigration detention center on the city's outskirts. About 40 more detainees were moved to the hotel -- and their rooms opened onto a balcony with a view of the street.

Saif Ali Saif peers out from his hotel room balcony where he has hung images of his three-year-old son.

Watching the world go by

Somali father-of-one Saif Ali Saif stands on his balcony each day, with his own sign scribbled in pen on an old T-shirt. It says: ""I want (to) hug my son."" His wife Sabah Siyad lives in community detention 29 kilometers (18 miles away) with their three-year-old son, Sammi. She gets a small government allowance each week and is not allowed to work or study. The family hasn't held each other since March, when visits stopped due to the coronavirus.

Saif worries Sammi will forget him.

Saif Ali Saif was able to receive visits from Sabah Siyad and their son Sammi before the coronavirus pandemic.

Saif escaped war while working as a driver in Yemen; Siyad ran from bombing in Somalia. She lifts her sleeve to show shrapnel scars as proof. The refugees met and married in Nauru in 2016 and Sammi was born on Valentine's Day the following year. Their baby was a few months old when it became apparent that his breathing difficulties required specialist care. Officials approved the baby's transfer to Australia with his mother but not Saif. ""I was really scared my son would die there,"" he said, so he let them go.

Saif was told last June he was being transferred to Australia and has now spent a year in detention. He says he doesn't know why he was transferred.

The family has been separated for three years. ""Sammi wants his father,"" Siyad said.

Iranian refugee Farhad Rahmati was transferred to Australia for treatment for a heart condition.

From his balcony, Rahmati, the Iranian refugee, can see a pub, a car wash, restaurants and a McDonald's on the next block.

""I see everything, but I have no chance to touch it,"" he said. ""I see people walking their dogs. I love dogs. I'd love to have a chance to, you know, to walk my dogs. But look at my situation. I'm not even close to that.""

Rahmati worked as a civil engineer before fleeing Iran in 2013. He doesn't want to talk about why he left.

While Rahmati and Saif stand on the balcony with signs, many detainees don't. They stay in their rooms, worried that protesting will affect their chances of ever being freed.

A detainee holds a sign to the window of his Kangaroo Point hotel room: ""Thank you.""

Strange events on the corner

Even before the signs went up, neighbors noticed something strange going on at the hotel on the corner: cars with blackened windows, guards with earpieces, trucks coming and going on a regular basis. No one told them what was going on at the hotel, which has been there for over a decade.

Central Apartment Group (CAG) took over the hotel's operation in 2018 and changed its name to Kangaroo Point Central Hotel and Apartments. It's one of 18 hotels on the company's website, advertised as family-friendly accommodation ""ideal for business and leisure travellers.""

When contacted by CNN, the group's CEO Sid Knell said he would not comment about events at Kangaroo Point. ""You can ask me about self-drive holidays,"" he said.

Nearby residents, however, have railed against the appearance of a prison on their street.

""How could they start a prison and not tell people?"" asked Annette Hogan. The residents CNN spoke to said they didn't have a problem with the refugees, but the walls and guards had changed the tone of the neighborhood. Opinions differed on the local Facebook page: ""Send them back,"" one post said.

Hannah and Anand Parameswaran have a direct view of the hotel grounds for their kitchen window. From there, they can see the small pool where guests used to swim. The detainees aren't allowed to use it.

""I feel a little bit guilty coming and going,"" said Hannah Parameswaran. Anand agrees: ""I feel really guilty because it's our money being used to do this to them.""

Temporary fences have been erected around the hotel, but the neighbors can see into the hotel grounds from their kitchen.

The Refugee Council of Australia estimates it costs the government 346,000 Australian dollars ($236,000) each year to hold someone in detention in Australia. That is on top of the AU$7 billion ($4.8 billion) the government spent on offshore processing from 2012, according to the Australian National Audit Office

Carmelo Nucifora, who runs Spizzico, the Italian restaurant on the hotel premises, says he wasn't consulted about plans for a prison on the site. As more fences went up, blocking off most of the restaurant's parking area, he said he sought a meeting with Australian Border Force officials. ""I went and pleaded to one of the officers. It's embarrassing, but I cried in front of them, pleading for some attention, for mercy,"" he said.

Like other restaurants in the city, he was forced to limit his business to takeaway only during the coronavirus lockdown. Takings plunged from around AU$14,000 a week to AU$2,000.

Now, even as coronavirus restrictions ease to allow more diners, his restaurant is surrounded by protesters.

Protesters camped in tents outside the hotel until police cleared the sidewalk. Then they moved across the street.

The protests

""Seven years too long. Free the refugees,"" chant protesters through a tannoy outside the hotel. Last Thursday, their weekly protest turned into a 24-hour occupation when word spread that Border Force officials had arrived to transfer Rahmati, the Iranian refugee, to BITA.

Cellphone footage shot by another detainee, and seen by CNN, shows Rahmati being led to a van by security guards, where they are ambushed by protesters, who stand on the roof and glue their hands to the van. Rahmati is hurried back inside the hotel and returned to his room.

Protesters don't want any of the men to be transferred deeper into Australia's immigration detention system. They're demanding the men be released into the community by Christmas.

But on Friday morning, the guards came back for Rahmati.

An Emergency Response Team burst into his room, ordered him to lie face down on his bed, cuffed him, flipped him over and took him to a waiting car, Rahmati said via cellphone from the high-security compound in BITA, where he was taken. Rahmati is in Australia receiving treatment for a heart condition.

Matt Sheppard, from rights group Refugee Solidarity Meanjin, says too few protesters were positioned outside a gate to stop the car that took Rahmati away. After that, protesters blockaded the exits and agreed only to clear them if they were able to search vehicles coming and going, to make sure no more refugees would be transferred.

Sheppard says he believes Rahmati was taken from the hotel because he spoke to the media.

""He's just a really charismatic person that provides a lot of support for the men inside as well. So, I think it was a calculated move to remove him from the community and break up that cohesion,"" he said.

In a statement , Australian Border Force Commissioner Michael Outram denied detainees were being ""punished"" or moved for speaking to advocates or the media. ""Detainees are routinely moved for a range of reasons, including health, welfare or to ensure the safety of other detainees, staff and the public,"" he said.

The day after Rahmati's removal, hundreds gathered in the street to call for the occupants' release. Saif, the Somali refugee, spoke from the balcony, his phone call amplified on speakers to the crowd. ""Let me hug my son,"" he said.

One by one, the crowd started chanting, ""Let him hug his son, let him hug his son."" They cleared a path to the hotel entrance so Siyad could push Sammi towards him in his pram. She got as far as the gate before the request was denied.

They don't know when they'll next be able to meet.

A spokeswoman for acting Immigration Minister Alan Tudge told CNN that ""it was made very clear to those who were transferred under the medevac provisions that they would be placed into immigration detention.""

David Manne, the executive director of Refugee Legal, said the law also allows the minister to release them.

""There are powers at the disposal of the government and the minister personally to release these men from detention. It's incumbent upon the federal government to explain why it's not using those legal powers to release these men from prolonged and indefinite detention,"" he said.

As a signatory to the 1951 Refugee Convention, Australia is obliged to provide a safe place of refuge for people fleeing persecution, or to resettle them elsewhere.

ABF Commissioner Outram said in his statement that the men are ""encouraged to finalize their medical treatment so they can continue on their resettlement pathway to the United States, return to Nauru or PNG or return to their home country.""

Manne said that despite many of their illnesses being severe or critical, there was ""significant information to cast doubt upon whether they are receiving or have received the medical treatment required.""

""It is abundantly clear that the prolonged, indefinite detention of these men, who were critically ill and brought to Australia for treatment, is almost certainly compounding the severity of their medical conditions,"" he said.

The immigration minister's spokeswoman said the men had access to medical professionals and specialists, and any claims to the contrary were incorrect.

Former immigration officer Rebecca Lim, from the Brisbane On-Arrival Refugee and Asylum Seeker Response Group, said volunteers were ready and waiting to help support the men in the Australian community -- when, and if, they are freed.

""If the minister is not making the decision to release the men into community detention because it is not in the public interest, then he needs to explain what that means,"" she said. ""Indefinite detention is wrong.""","In this Australian hotel, refugee and asylum seeker guests are not allowed to leave",https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/19/australia/australia-manus-nauru-hotel-brisbane-hnk-intl/index.html,2020-06-19
Angus Watson,"Sydney/Hong Kong (CNN Business) The Australian government is grappling with massive cyber attacks from what Prime Minister Scott Morrison has described as a ""malicious"" and ""sophisticated"" state-based actor.

Morrison revealed the existence of the attacks during a press conference on Friday, adding that a ""state-based cyber actor"" is ""targeting Australian organizations across a range of sectors, including all levels of government, industry, political organizations, education, health, essential service providers and operators of other critical infrastructure.""

He did not specify which agencies or businesses are believed to be under attack, nor did he detail the exact nature of the attacks — though he did say that the government's investigation has not uncovered any ""large-scale personal data breaches.""

Morrison also did not say which state Australia believes to be behind the attack. But he told reporters that ""there are not a large number of state-based actors that can engage in this type of activity.""

""It is clear ... that this has been done by a state-based actor with very, very significant capabilities,"" Morrison added.

Isaac Yee,"Hong Kong (CNN Business) Australian flagship carrier Qantas (QABSY) has canceled most of its international flights for the next four months on the expectation that the coronavirus pandemic will last through most of the year.

A Qantas spokesperson pointed out that the country's tourism minister, Simon Birmingham, recently said Australia's international borders with most countries are unlikely to reopen until 2021.

Analysis Laura He,"Hong Kong (CNN Business) American executives in Hong Kong are nervous about the city's future as a center for global business. For the minority already considering a Plan B, though, Singapore might be the only realistic option.

More than 50 respondents to a recent survey conducted by the American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) in Hong Kong said they were considering moving capital, assets or business operations to ""other locations"" after Beijing approved plans for a national security law for Hong Kong. The law will be drafted over the next two months and its implementation will bypass the city's legislature

The law bans sedition, secession and subversion against Beijing and allows Chinese state security to operate in Hong Kong, but it's not yet clear exactly what it would mean for business: Even the city's top officials have offered few details on how it would work.

But its existence has drawn ire from Western countries like the United States, which has threatened to end a special economic and trading relationship with Hong Kong. Beijing's encroaching authority in the semi-autonomous city has also sparked fears about whether more restrictive measures could be introduced that would affect Hong Kong's tax structure and open regulatory environment for foreign companies.

While only 180 AmCham members took the survey — about 15% of the organization's membership — the responses suggest that alternatives to Hong Kong are on the table for dozens of companies. AmCham said its respondents listed several relocation options, including Singapore, Sydney, Tokyo, Bangkok and Taipei.

It's ""only natural to think about alternative locations in case business conditions deteriorate quickly,"" said David Dollar, a senior fellow at the John L. Thornton China Center, part of the Washington-based Brookings Institution.

But for many American firms that are developing contingency plans, there really isn't a lot of competition. And of the options available, only one other financial hub stands out.

""China's move undermines the confidence that companies have in Hong Kong as a location for doing business related to China and the rest of East Asia,"" Mauro Guillen, professor of international management at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, told CNN Business. ""If they see problems and uncertainty, many will leave. The winners? Singapore, Singapore and Singapore.""

Why Singapore?

The Southeast Asian city-state has for years been one of the region's top financial centers. While Hong Kong still boasts a much larger stock market and remains Asia's preferred city for share issues, the Singaporean government has worked to grow its status as a business hub. Analysts often cite Singapore's convertible currency and favorable regulatory environment as positives for foreign companies.

In 2018, Deloitte ranked Singapore second only to Switzerland as an international wealth management center, in terms of competitiveness and performance. And last fall, Singapore knocked the United States out of the top spot in the World Economic Forum's annual competitiveness report, scoring high marks for its infrastructure, health, labor market and financial system.

Singapore has for years been one of Asia's top business centers.

The city state has also developed a reputation as a hub for biotech firms, according to Rob Chipman, CEO of Asian Tigers Group, a Hong Kong-based relocation services firm. Chipman is a former chairman of AmCham in Hong Kong.

GlaxoSmithKline GSK Merck MRK ""If you are in microtechnology or biotech industry and need to have physical presence, you may want to move to Singapore for business purposes,"" he said. Companies likeand Roche Diagnostics, for example, have regional headquarters in the city.

Singapore is also the only meaningful option for many financial services firms, according to Vincent Chan, China strategist for Alētheia Capital, an Asian investment advisory firm based in Hong Kong. Chan was previously the managing director and head of China equity strategy at Credit Suisse.

English, after all, is an official language in Singapore — a quality Chan called key for foreign businesses looking at potential regional headquarters. The language is far less pervasive in cities like Tokyo, Bangkok and Taipei, making them ""less advantageous,"" he said.

Geographical proximity to other major business hubs is also a positive. Travel time is critical for companies that often need to manage different markets in the Asia Pacific region, which stretches from the northernmost borders of China and Mongolia to the southern tip of Australia and neighboring New Zealand.

That rules out cities like Sydney, said Chan, who noted that flying between the Australian city and places like Tokyo and Beijing can take roughly 10 hours. By comparison, Singapore is only a few hours from many of the region's most important players.

There are some concerns, however. Last year, for example, the Singaporean government introduced a controversial fake news law that critics said was leading to increased censorship and official overreach in a country where freedom of expression is already under pressure.

The analysts who spoke to CNN Business, though, said that free speech issues — in Hong Kong, Singapore and elsewhere — aren't nearly as concerning to businesses as fears of financial instability or change.

Singapore has taken ""economic freedom"" seriously, said Brock Silvers, chief investment officer for Adamas Asset Management based in Hong Kong.

""While that economic freedom doesn't always translate into social or other non-economic arenas, Western investors are still generally inclined to favor Singaporean paternalism over Chinese authoritarianism,"" he added.

Some may adjust

Despite Singapore's reputation as a stable financial hub, experts stressed that Hong Kong is still the top choice for most businesses.

""Yes, people are moving to Singapore from Hong Kong. But that has been going on all the time,"" said Chipman, of the Asian Tigers Group. ""It's nothing new at all.""

Other analysts pointed out only some types of companies with a large presence in Hong Kong may need to consider what options they have. And even then, it depends on how the business environment changes.

Tech firms, for example, might consider Hong Kong untenable if the city is no longer exempt from US export controls, according to Jeffrey Wright, a Washington-based analyst for Eurasia Group. US President Donald Trump said in May that Washington wants to revoke the special treatment it gives Hong Kong , impacting the ""full range"" of agreements they share — including export controls.

Financial services firms, meanwhile, may still be waiting to see whether the Trump administration's actions impact them. Trump hasn't yet detailed any measures that could affect that sector.

For many global companies, China is also the major reason they're in Asia. That makes Hong Kong's proximity to the mainland a big plus, and an advantage that Singapore just can't match.

""The global firms with multiple offices retain their most senior management in Hong Kong for Asia-Pacific, and in Singapore for southeast Asia,"" wrote David Meyer, senior lecturer in management at Washington University in St. Louis, in a report published online in April.

Some foreign companies might be comfortable operating under Chinese law in the end, according to Silvers — especially if their business is ""significantly China focused, or reliant on government good will.""",Hong Kong has only one real rival for businesses thinking about leaving,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/10/investing/singapore-hong-kong-american-companies-intl-hnk/index.html,2020-06-10
Cnn Staff,"(CNN) Children around the world have been impacted by Covid-19, and they understandably have curiosity and concerns about what's going on. CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta is joined by CNN10 anchor Carl Azuz to answer some of the key questions on kids' minds these days.

Gupta: Today's episode is going to be a little different. So far on this podcast I've spoken to a lot of adults -- scientists, doctors, and even an astronaut.

But they're not the only ones thinking about the coronavirus. Kids are listening and asking questions, too. Oftentimes, they ask the questions that adults are too embarrassed to ask. We've heard from a bunch of you and I hope I can help you understand what's going on right now.

I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent. And this is ""Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction.""

Gupta: A lot of kids around the world want to know when they can see their friends again.

I wish I could tell you I knew exactly when you could go back to having playdates and learning from your teachers in person, but there's just no answer to that yet. That's one of the hardest things about life during this time -- not having answers.

But I've gotten some amazing questions from you, and I'm going to try and answer them the best I can. I've also brought in my friend Carl Azuz -- many of you probably know him as the anchor of CNN10 in classrooms across the country.

Carl Azuz (on CNN10): We know what it's doing, we know where it's spreading, but where did Covid-19 come from? That's the first thing we're looking at today on CNN10 and we're happy to have you along for the hunt.

Gupta: Hey Carl!

Azuz: Sanjay, it's always a pleasure to work with you. Thank you for thinking of me.

Gupta: So, let's jump right in. Our first question comes from Micah in Maryland.

Micah: I wonder where the coronavirus came from. If it was from bats, how did it change or mutate? Thank you, stay well.

Gupta: Thanks, Micah. Scientists do think that this coronavirus did come from bats in China. What we're not entirely sure about is exactly how it got into humans. It could be that the bat made another animal sick and then that animal got a human sick. Or it could be that it spread directly from bats to humans. It is also possible that the bats were studied in a lab and that the virus spread to humans that way. We just don't know yet. Next we have a question from PJ in Florida.

PJ: Will we have to wear masks in public forever? Thank you.

Azuz: I have good news for you, PJ. No, we are not going to have to wear masks in public forever, although some people might think they're pretty fashionable and want to keep it going. That's the good news. The bad news is we don't know when we'll be able to take them off.

Gupta: That's right, Carl. And I think it's also important to remember that when you wear a mask, it's to help protect other people from you. It makes it less likely that you can spread the germs from you to somebody else. Remember, even if you're not sick, even if you're not coughing or sneezing, if you have the virus inside your body, you could possibly spread it to others. A mask helps prevent you from doing that.

Azuz: Alright, Sachin is in New York City with our next question.

Sachin: What do the germs look like? What do the germs feel like when you have them?

Azuz: Sachin, I have no idea what germs look like. I think Dr. Sanjay Gupta might be the best person to answer that one.

Gupta: Sachin, the thing about germs and viruses like this is that they are too small for us to see or feel even on our skin. But that doesn't mean that scientists haven't been able to use microscopes and get a good look at them. This coronavirus is called coronavirus because corona means crown. So this looks like a little blob with a crown on top of it. That crown is actually a bunch of little spikes that the virus uses to move around and to get inside the body. That's the reason you have to wash your hands a lot, because when you use soap and water, you can actually clean those germs off your hands even if you can't see it happening. Even though you can't see these germs or these viruses, they are all over the place. They're on door handles, sometimes they're on your toys. But the good news is that many of these germs aren't going to make you that sick. Now we have a question from Abby, in Washington, DC.

Abby: My question about coronavirus is: Will I be able to go to camp and different places in the summer?

Gupta: Abby, this is probably the number one question that I get even in my own home. What are things going to be like this summer? Well, Abby, there's a good chance that we may still have to be home this summer. We still don't know yet. We got to make sure that in different places around the country, things are headed in the right direction, that there are fewer people getting sick, that more people can get tested. When we get to that point, we may start to slowly open things back up. The one thing, Abby, we don't want to happen is that more people get sick that didn't need to because they went out too early. Now we have a question from Leonard in California.

Leonard: Are there any drugs that can actually help you not get this virus?

Azuz: Well I don't know if I would call it a drug, Leonard, but I can say that washing your hands is a really good way to keep yourself safe from this virus.

Dr. Gupta: Yep, right now, the only medications for this coronavirus are ones that help treat your symptoms. So if you have a cough, runny nose or a fever, there are certain medicines that can help with that. But there are scientists all around the world in labs who are working at different treatments to treat the virus itself. And hopefully by the summer, we may have some good answers on that.

Azuz: You know Sanjay, you are a doctor, you're going to have some pretty good points. And that was another one. You want to make sure that you are doing other things you can do just to keep yourself healthy, besides washing your hands, to eat a healthy diet. Fruits and vegetables. Make sure you get lots of sleep. Make sure you get some exercise as long as you're, you know, not getting too close to other people. And it's a good idea to do that, whether or not there's a threat from coronavirus. Santiago in California is next.

Santiago: Will more families become poorer after this passes? I'm worried that my family or other families will become hungry or homeless.

Azuz: Santiago, that's a very important question. I'm sorry that you're worried about it. As far as families becoming poorer, we do know that a lot of people have lost their jobs. There are a lot of folks who are unable to work right now because businesses are closed down. But there are also a lot of folks helping others. For one thing, the US government has spent trillions of dollars trying to get money to people in need. Also, we've heard from a number of different charity organizations.

We know some churches are involved in helping their communities. And then there are some folks who are just giving lunches to students who might normally get those at school but can't because of the coronavirus. So the good thing here, Santiago, is the fact that so many people are helping others in different communities. And that's something that gives us all hope. And last question is from North Carolina. Sydney, what's on your mind?

Sydney: When will the coronavirus be over? When will the scientists get a cure for the coronavirus and how will they find it?

Azuz: Thanks for the question, Sydney. If it were up to me, it would be over in five minutes. Everybody would be healthy. You'd be able to go back to school, hang out with your friends, go to concerts, all the fun stuff that you and your parents love to do.

Gupta: That's right, Carl. Sydney, everybody wants the answer to this question. One thing we need to make sure we can do is start to test people for the virus. Letting them know whether they have it in their bodies and making sure that if they do, they don't spread it to other people. Right now, Sydney, one of the most promising things out there is that scientists are working on finding a vaccine. That's a medicine that can help teach your body how to fight the virus. We probably won't have a vaccine until next year some time. But once that happens, that will protect us against this virus, just like a flu shot protects you against the flu.

Gupta: These have all been really great questions. Thank you so much for sending them in. And Carl, thank you very much. I really appreciate it. You have such a great way of talking to kids. I know they adore you.

Azuz: Hey, thank you, Sanjay. Always a pleasure working with you. Happy to be here.

Michelle Toh,"Hong Kong (CNN Business) HSBC has carved out a lucrative role in global banking over the past 155 years by straddling the line between East and West. Now, a political firestorm over the bank's hometown of Hong Kong could force the bank to choose sides.

The lender, which began life as the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, is based in London but makes most of its money in Asia. Last month, it waded into the political fight over Hong Kong's future by publicly backing a controversial security law Beijing was imposing on the financial hub.

The law criminalizes secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign powers, and critics say it undercuts political and legal freedoms that have existed since Britain handed the former colony to China in 1997. Hong Kong authorities insist the law is needed to restore stability after months of pro-democracy protests

The United Kingdom has joined the United States in condemning China , accusing it of breaching the handover agreement that established the ""one country, two systems"" principle for Hong Kong. London is also offering millions of Hong Kong citizens an escape route through a new immigration plan

China's ambassador to the United Kingdom, Liu Xiaoming, responded this week by accusing the country of ""gross interference"" in Hong Kong and saying any treatment of China as an enemy is ""completely wrong.""

HSBC's relationship with both countries makes it an obvious target as relations worsen, according to Willy Lam, an adjunct professor for the Center of China Studies at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.

Even though the bank has been based in the United Kingdom since 1992, Hong Kong is its biggest market and accounts for over half of the group's profits. Asia more broadly delivered more than 80% of HSBC's profits last year. The bank is planning to shift more resources to the region in the near future as it carries out a sweeping restructuring plan

HSBC HSBC declined to provide further comment on its support for the law. But the firm's leaders have reasons to be worried about potential fallout.

HSBC Chairman Mark Tucker has privately warned the British government that the bank could face reprisals from Beijing if Huawei, the Chinese tech giant, is prevented from doing business in the United Kingdom, The Telegraph reported last month, citing anonymous sources.

Split between two worlds

HSBC was founded in 1865 by Scottish businessman Thomas Sutherland. His heritage is reflected in the bank's red and white hexagonal logo, which takes its inspiration from the cross of St. Andrew.

Until the 1990s, it was generally referred to simply as ""Hong Kong bank,"" according to historians David Kynaston and Richard Roberts, who tracked the company's rise in the book, ""The Lion Wakes: A Modern History of HSBC.""

It once even acted as Hong Kong's unofficial monetary authority in some capacities as the city's economy opened up to the world, printing currency and setting the stage for foreign exchange, Kynaston and Roberts wrote.

""It could be said that we are a quasi-central bank,"" HSBC's former chairman, Michael Sandberg, is quoted in the book as saying in 1976. ""Hong Kong's interests and well-being are very much in tune with ours.""

In 1992, HSBC moved its headquarters to London to comply with takeover regulations after acquiring Midland Bank, a large British retail bank that helped its new owner almost double its employee headcount.

Since then, the company has periodically mulled the idea of relocating its headquarters away from London.

In 2015, the same year the bank announced a ""pivot to Asia,"" the board deliberated the move , conducting a 10-month review of its operations around the world. Hong Kong was seen as the natural choice, given its deep roots there and the allure of lower corporate taxes. But the company's directors ultimately decided to stay put

Former CEO Stuart Gulliver said at the time that having headquarters in the United Kingdom and a ""significant"" chunk of the business in Asia Pacific ""delivers the best of both worlds to our stakeholders.""

Even as the company's business grows elsewhere, HSBC may want to stay in London so as to not lose its status as a globally focused bank, according to Dragon Tang, a professor of finance at the University of Hong Kong. He added that moving away from the United Kingdom could be seen as a sign of giving up on the European market.

A company spokesperson referred CNN Business to a previous statement that said ""there are no discussions to review HSBC's global headquarters, and no plans to reopen the issue.""

Forced to choose

HSBC has a lot riding on Hong Kong — and politicians know it.

In May, former Hong Kong leader Leung Chun-ying singled out the bank for its silence on the law, demanding that HSBC express its support.

Facebook FB ""HSBC's profits come mainly from China,"" Leung wrote in a post . ""Neither China nor Hong Kong owe HSBC anything. Its business in China could be replaced overnight by banks from China or other countries.""

Leung also told the Financial Times that month that ""HSBC has been enjoying unique privileges in Hong Kong, which should not be taken for granted.""

Days later, HSBC posted a photo on Chinese social media showing its Asia Pacific CEO signing a petition supporting the national security law in Hong Kong. (The photo was published before the law was passed and before the full legal text was published.)

It didn't take long for Britain to respond . UK political leaders piled on the bank last month, questioning why the company would allow one of its executives to make such a political statement.

""I just thought, 'Wow,'"" said Alistair Carmichael, a British lawmaker who joined several members of parliament in writing to HSBC to express concern about the move. He argued that by caving to Beijing's demands, the company has essentially ""offered themselves up"" as a political football.

""They did themselves no good whatsoever,"" Carmichael told CNN Business, adding that he and his colleagues had yet to hear back from the bank. ""Once you pick a side, it's very hard to walk away from that side.""

HSBC declined to comment on criticism the bank has received from UK politicians.

The bank has also long been floated as a potential target for retaliation by Beijing in its battle with the West over trade, technology and national security.

Huawei, for example, has for months been trying to persuade the UK government that it can be trusted to help build the country's 5G network — a partnership that looks increasingly like it might fall apart

Liu, the Chinese ambassador, warned this week that Britain ""will have to bear the consequences"" should it treat China as a ""hostile country.""

And while he didn't mention HSBC by name, Chinese state media has previously suggested that the bank could appear on a long-rumored list of ""unreliable"" foreign companies that China could blacklist.

Retaliation from China isn't all that HSBC needs to worry about. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has blasted the company for its actions, saying that ""corporate kowtows"" would not earn the bank respect in Beijing.

On Tuesday, Bloomberg reported that Washington was also looking for ""ways to punish banks based in Hong Kong, particularly HSBC."" One proposal that is being considered, according to the report, is to damage the peg between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar.

HSBC declined to comment on the news report. The company's Hong Kong-listed shares fell 4.3% on Wednesday after the report, while its shares listed in London dropped 2.9%. The stock continued to slump Thursday in Hong Kong.

There's unease within HSBC's staff, too. An HSBC employee who has been with the bank for several years told CNN Business that workers in Hong Kong were upset when they learned of the company's support for the law.

""I am so disappointed,"" said the employee, who requested anonymity because he feared being targeted for his comments. ""Obviously, the bank could imagine that there are some concerns.""

HSBC declined to comment on the reaction from staff.

The employee said that he wrote to management last year expressing concern about Hong Kong's increasingly politicized business environment, and that the company had assured him it would stay out of the political fray.

""I used to be very proud of the bank,"" he said. But ""if you asked me the question of whether I feel proud or not to be one of the members in this bank, definitely the answer at this moment would be 'no.'""

As diplomatic tensions simmer, some observers caution that the company could be forced off the political fence again.

""They are between the devil and the deep blue sea. They will want to see how the situation in China and Hong Kong settles down. They'll want to see how much the political heat in the UK persists,"" Philip Augar, a UK banking expert, told BBC Radio 4 on Tuesday.

""But in the end,"" he added, ""I think they're bound to listen more to the Chinese side.""

Laura Smith-Spark,"Szczecin, Poland (CNN) Poland is a country deeply divided over cultural issues, and the direction the former Soviet bloc nation should take next: does it want to be a European-style liberal democracy, or does it take a more authoritarian path?

The government's erosion of gay rights has put it on a collision course with Europe, as have its radical reforms to the courts. These changes are viewed by other European Union leaders as having politicized the judiciary and undermined the rule of law.

Now the country will go to the polls Sunday for a second-round vote in what could be the country's most consequential presidential election in decades. The outcome could shape Poland's future direction within the European Union and reverberate well beyond its borders.

The battle between the remaining candidates -- populist incumbent Andrzej Duda, backed by the ruling Law and Justice party (PiS), and his more liberal challenger, Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski, of the center-right Civic Platform party -- has become increasingly contentious.

US President Donald Trump walks with his Polish counterpart Andrzej Duda before a press conference at the White House last month.

President Duda came out on top in the first round on June 28 with 43.5% of the ballots cast, according to the National Electoral Commission, while Trzaskowski, who entered the race only a few weeks ago, took about 30.5% of the vote. Turnout was high, at over 64%.

But observers predict a much closer second round, as the pair fight to pass the vital 50% threshold by winning over voters who backed candidates now out of the race.

During campaigning, Duda -- who met with US President Donald Trump at the White House last month -- has sought to mobilize his more conservative, largely rural base with appeals to traditional Catholic values and a promise to maintain popular social welfare policies, such as a child allowance and lower pension age.

as an ""ideology"" worse than Soviet-era communism sparked wide criticism, prompting Duda to But comments in which he described LGBTQ rightsas an ""ideology"" worse than Soviet-era communism sparked wide criticism, prompting Duda to tweet that his words had been ""put out of context"" as part of a dirty political fight.

""I truly believe in diversity and equality,"" he said, before adding: ""At the same time, beliefs of any minority cannot be imposed on a majority under the false pretense of tolerance.""

Presidential candidate Rafal Trzaskowski delivers a speech to locals and supporters during a campaign rally on July 7 in Gniezno, Poland.

Trzaskowski, who has previously served as an opposition minister and member of the European Parliament in Brussels, told CNN the election was important because ""the current government is monopolizing all the power"" and attacking key institutions.

""We need a break, we need a balance of power where the president of the Republic can cooperate with the government as needed -- for instance, when it comes to restoring good relations with the European Union -- but who is ready to veto legislation, for instance, that meddles with the rule of law,"" he said Wednesday in Szczecin, northwest Poland, where he was holding a campaign rally.

The government wants to focus debate solely on the LGBTQ issue, Trzaskowski said. As mayor of Warsaw, he said, ""I was always standing next to those who are marginalized. Disabled people, people of minorities, people are sent to the margins of society by this government.""

And if reelected, Duda is likely to continue to rubber-stamp the agenda shaped by PiS leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski, Piotr Buras, head of the Warsaw office of the European Council on Foreign Relations, told CNN.

Basic rights

LGBTQ protesters rallied in the capital, Warsaw, on Thursday against Duda's position on gay rights.

Just on Monday, Duda signed a draft amendment to the Constitution which, if approved, would bar the adoption of a child by a same-sex couple, saying his goal was to ""support the Polish family, protect Polish children.""

Trzaskowski also said in recent days that he's against the adoption of children by same-sex couples but has previously committed to supporting LGBTQ rights.

Trzaskowski supporter Jakub Lipczinsky, who attended the rally Wednesday in Szczecin, told CNN he was ""deeply concerned about what's happening with our basic rights"" at the hands of the current government.

""I have to say that I have never seen such a reckless attitude against our beliefs, our values,"" he said. ""And it is with such an arrogance. And so it is of utmost importance for us to stop this process of breaking law. If our candidate won the election, it would be a great step toward the improvement of this political situation in our country.""

Lipczinsky said he believed in respecting other people's views on their sexuality and their right to express themselves freely. ""Once your basic right to express yourself and your sexuality is broken it is difficult to still speak of a democracy,"" he said.

Another Trzaskowski supporter, Hannah Nikolaiczyk, told CNN the politician represented change that was much needed.

""It is important that Poland is not closed and separated from other countries,"" she said. ""It is important to work with them. It's important to see the change that is about to happen and I hope that Poles see that as well.""

Nikolaiczyk said she was motivated by concerns over LGBT rights and the constitution, but also issues such as health care and its approach to Europe. ""I think it is important to be open instead of closing and doing everything against connections with other countries,"" she said.

Andrzej Krasnitzky, also at the rally, described Duda as ""like a puppet on a string in the hands of Kaczynski"" and said he feared that after another five years with him in power ""our democracy will completely be destroyed.""

President Andrzej Duda delivers a speech during a campaign rally on July 4 in Wroclaw, Poland.

Others disagree, saying Duda and the ruling coalition are carrying out much-needed reforms.

Jakub, a 48-year-old Duda supporter in Warsaw who declined to give CNN his last name, said: ""I vote for Duda because I want to ensure continuity of government so that the current government can continue reforms. This government has evened out the social divide in Poland and President Duda is necessary, so that what was done would not be wasted.""

Duda's campaign has not yet responded to a request for comment on claims that the President has undermined the rule of law in Poland, eroded gay rights and rubber-stamped the PiS agenda.

Collision course with Europe

Although cultural issues have dominated campaigning, the outcome of the election has wider ramifications for Europe.

As one of the largest economies in the bloc, a big player in central Europe and a major beneficiary of EU funding, Poland should have clout.

But if Duda is reelected, Poland is likely to remain ""sitting on the sidelines in Europe,"" said Milan Nic, of the German Council on Foreign Relations, ""not playing its full weight... and seen as simply on a different wavelength to Germany and the rest of western Europe"" on issues such as climate policy and energy, thanks to its reliance on coal.

Trzaskowski told CNN he wanted to see Poland back at the table. ""Poland and this government are completely marginalized within the European Union. So it's not treated that seriously by the big powers,"" he said.

If Poland continues on its current path, in which the rule of law has been undermined by a politicization of the judiciary and public media, fellow EU member states may try to rein it in by attaching conditionality to EU funding, Buras suggested. But the PiS has until now been emboldened by the example of Hungary, where Viktor Orban has imposed an increasingly authoritarian rule in defiance of the EU.

Gerald Knaus, chairman of the European Stability Initiative think tank, said this election could be a turning point.

""One of the most important issues is the relationship between Poland and what has been the framework for the most successful period in Polish history -- EU membership,"" he told CNN from Berlin.

""The position of the PiS, which Duda has been supporting in recent years, is that Poland can remain a full member of the EU and can benefit and continue to benefit more than any other countries from structural assistance while charting an independent course on issues like the rule of law.""

Looking beyond Europe, both candidates are keen to maintain strong ties with the United States, which has troops stationed in Poland and is a longstanding ally.

Duda has forged a tight relationship with Trump since the US President visited Warsaw in 2017.

Trzaskowski, on the other hand, tweeted on July 1 that he would be speaking with former US President Barack Obama that evening ""about the importance of Polish democracy within the European Union and the significance of the U.S.-Polish alliance.""

What is the path to victory?

Despite his apparent momentum, Trzaskowski faces an uphill struggle to claim victory on Sunday based on the first-round tallies.

Duda has presided over a period during which Poland's economy has been in very good shape, said Buras, in part because of reforms enacted by the government since it was elected in 2015. And his message to voters is that the very close cooperation between president and government is in the interests of Poland and should continue.

Duda's harsh language on LGBT issues appears to be an attempt to mobilize the so-called ""silent majority"" by painting Trzaskowski ""as someone who, once elected, will be a source of cultural Armageddon,"" Buras said, although this approach may have reached its limit.

In Sunday's vote, Trzaskowski is likely to garner support from those who previously backed third-placed Szymon Holownia, a former TV host who ran as an independent, and left-wing candidates.

But to win, he must also pick up voters who supported far-right Confederation candidate Krzysztof Bosak two weeks ago, said Buras.

Although some will prefer Duda for his conservative values, others may now back Trzaskowski for reasons of free market radicalism, since they dislike the big-state spending of the PiS, or simply to prevent PiS from killing off their party as its chief competitor on the right, said Buras.

The fact that the second-round vote falls in the holiday season may benefit Duda, since the more affluent, urban voters who tend to back Trzaskowski are more likely to be away, said Nic.

But it's not yet clear how fears over the coronavirus -- or the fact that Poles already made the effort to vote in the first round -- will affect turnout, or how the debate over gay rights will galvanize voters.

""Trzaskowski stands for a more active Polish presence in the EU, more pro-European, more ambitious for climate policy and energy transformation,"" said Buras. ""But in the end he bets on those voters who feel fed up with the PiS.""",Trump ally battles a liberal challenger.

Chandler Thornton,"(CNN) Facebook has removed dozens of what it said are fake social media accounts linked to the offices of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and his sons. The accounts were used to target journalists and political opponents of the president, and also discussed the coronavirus.

In a statement Wednesday , Facebook's Head of Security Policy Nathaniel Gleicher said the company took down ""35 Facebook accounts, 14 Pages, 1 Group and 38 Instagram accounts that were involved in coordinated inauthentic behavior in Brazil.""

Gleicher wrote the people behind the accounts ""attempted to conceal their identities,"" but were discovered to be ""associated with the Social Liberal Party and some of the employees of the offices of Anderson Moraes, Alana Passos, Eduardo Bolsonaro , Flavio Bolsonaro and Jair Bolsonaro.""

The accounts reportedly posted about ""domestic politics and elections."" They also posted ""criticism of the political opposition, media organizations and journalists, and most recently they posted about the coronavirus pandemic,"" Facebook said, adding that one or more of the social media pages had more than 883,000 followers.

The social network removed the accounts not for their content, but for ""inauthentic"" activity that aimed ""to evade enforcement, create fictitious personas posing as reporters, post content, and manage Pages masquerading as news outlets.""

President Bolsonaro has not commented on the Facebook action. However, when asked about the accounts, his eldest son Flavio Bolsonaro told CNN that ""as far as we know, they are all free and independent.""

He also questioned ""whether or not the platform [Facebook] exceeded the limits of censorship"" in removing the accounts. ""Judgments that do not allow for contradiction and wide defense are not compatible with our democracy, they are weapons that can destroy reputations and lives,"" he said.

Brian Fung,"Washington (CNN Business) The short-form video app TikTok has quickly become a key part of popular culture in the US, serving as a platform for viral memes as well as political satire and activism . Facebook, the dominant force in social media, has tried to copy the app, but so far that has not slowed down its rapid rise.

But now TikTok faces the most direct threat to its expansion in the US -- not from a competitor, but from the US government. President Donald Trump said Tuesday his administration is ""looking at"" banning the app, which is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, affirming remarks on Monday by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

It's just the latest, and most high-profile, example of Washington raising alarms about the app that's popular among younger users in the US, where TikTok has been downloaded 165 million times . Other prominent critics have previously highlighted TikTok as a potential spying threat. Last year, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Arkansas Republican Sen. Tom Cotton called for the intelligence community to assess the risk TikTok may pose to national security.

TikTok has pushed back on those claims, calling them ""unfounded."" To underscore its independence from China, TikTok has cited its recently hired American CEO, and said it has ""never provided user data to the Chinese government, nor would we do so if asked.""

The US is not alone in seeking to clamp down on TikTok. India said this week it would ban TikTok and other Chinese apps after a bloody border clash between Indian and Chinese soldiers.

Although leaders like Pompeo have described TikTok as a clear and present danger, many in the cybersecurity community say the reality is more complex. While TikTok could become a clear threat to US security under certain scenarios, they say, the danger is currently largely hypothetical or indirect. Some analysts also say the matter is complicated by Trump's aggressive approach to China overall — arguing the situation is a reflection of the administration's political priorities. Experts have raised similar concerns about Trump's approach to Huawei, the Chinese tech giant, saying Trump has inappropriately conflated national security with trade negotiations.

""The Trump administration has taken almost like a whack-a-mole approach to dealing with these issues, because it seems that as soon as a Chinese company is in the news, all of a sudden that becomes the new target,"" said Justin Sherman, a fellow with the Cyber Statecraft Initiative at the Atlantic Council. ""It seems very unlikely that there is thinking going on about the longer term strategy, and much more likely that the focus instead is on this politically motivated attack on an application because it's a Chinese-owned app, even if there are real security questions.""

The China question

To understand why policymakers view TikTok as a risk, it helps to know how the company works. TikTok is owned by the world's most valuable startup , a Chinese company named ByteDance. But TikTok does not operate in China and functions as an independent subsidiary.

Policymakers' chief worry is that ByteDance could be forced to hand over TikTok's data on US users to the Chinese government, under the country's national security laws. TikTok has said it stores American user data on US-based servers that aren't subject to Chinese law; skeptics argue TikTok's parent, ByteDance, is ultimately a Chinese business that's still beholden to Beijing.

But several security experts told CNN Business that, although TikTok's links to a private Chinese company are worthy of concern, the app simply wouldn't be that useful for espionage.

""It's right to be suspicious of the Chinese,"" said James Lewis, senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a security think tank. ""But I'm not sure TikTok is a good intelligence tool for them.""

Like some other social media apps and technology companies, TikTok automatically gathers users' geolocation information, IP addresses, unique device identifiers and the content of in-app messages, according to its privacy policy . That is a lot of data, but far more sensitive information -- and potentially more damaging to national security -- was exposed by data breaches affecting the Office of Personnel Management, announced in 2015, and Equifax, disclosed in 2017, according to Lewis.

China's national security laws contain more gray areas than many realize, according to Samm Sacks, a senior fellow at Yale Law School who has studied the Chinese laws. Chinese companies have successfully Even if TikTok collected enough of the right kind of data from the right people to pose a unique threat, it is not guaranteed the Chinese government would be able to access it easily.China's national security laws contain more gray areas than many realize, according to Samm Sacks, a senior fellow at Yale Law School who has studied the Chinese laws. Chinese companies have successfully resisted or thrown up roadblocks to Beijing's demands for data in the past, Sacks told lawmakers at a Senate hearing in March.

""The Chinese government does not necessarily have unfettered real-time access to all companies' data,"" Sacks said in her testimony. ""Chinese corporate actors are not synonymous with the Chinese government or the Chinese Communist Party, and have their own commercial interests to protect.""

Concerning security flaws

An alarming technical report about TikTok this year has only added to the concerns about its security, though experts say there is an important distinction between identifying individual security gaps and labeling something a threat to national security.

In January, a team of security researchers announced they had found several vulnerabilities in TikTok. The flaws, if left unpatched, could have let attackers gain control of TikTok accounts, change the privacy settings on TikTok videos, upload videos without permission, and obtain user data such as email addresses.

The discovery raised important questions about TikTok's ability to safeguard user privacy. But company engineers appeared to operate in good faith, according to Oded Vanunu, a security specialist at Check Point Research, who led the group of researchers that announced the findings. TikTok, he said, seemed motivated to fix the flaws.

""They were concerned about the optics of it, and their PR people, there was some friction there,"" said Vanunu. ""But from our perspective they were very happy to get this kind of information and were happy to cooperate.""

Asked whether the vulnerabilities he found might lend credence to claims TikTok cannot be trusted, Vanunu said security flaws are something that all software companies grapple with, even large ones . The difference, he said, is that TikTok is a relatively young and inexperienced company.

""TikTok is committed to protecting user data,"" TikTok said in a statement at the time of the disclosure. ""Like many organizations, we encourage responsible security researchers to privately disclose zero day vulnerabilities to us.""

The bigger concern with TikTok

Even as technical experts describe TikTok's espionage risk in mostly theoretical terms, policymakers argue TikTok could still threaten US interests in softer ways — by influencing the global conversation on its platform. And in this respect, some experts warn, the danger is already being felt.

TikTok has faced mounting criticism, for example, over its handling of content that's critical of the Chinese government. Last year The Guardian reported on leaked documents that it said instructed moderators to clamp down on critiques of socialism and Tiananmen Square. ByteDance told The Guardian at the time that those guidelines were outdated.

In November, allegations of politically motivated censorship increased when several former US employees of TikTok told The Washington Post they often felt pressured to clamp down on videos that their colleagues in Beijing found subversive, prompting Schumer and Cotton to express concerns in their letter to intelligence officials.

TikTok has said that its content and moderation policies are developed by a team of American employees and that the policies are not influenced by any foreign government. TikTok's investors include large international names such as Sequoia Capital and Softbank, and in May, the company hired Kevin Mayer, a former Disney executive, as its CEO.

TikTok could become a major platform for misleading speech, policymakers and security experts fear. Reports have already found In addition to restricting some speech,TikTok could become a major platform for misleading speech, policymakers and security experts fear. Reports have already found Pizzagate conspiracy theorists on the platform and users spreading false claims about the coronavirus . And if TikTok were to suffer a data breach, said Vanunu, it might be that much easier to target users with bogus information that could undercut American democracy.

So TikTok's handling of content and user data could plausibly weaken US power and influence, experts say, but more abstractly than directly spying on government officials or monitoring troop movements.

That says more about the US's lack of policies regulating data, privacy and platforms than it does about TikTok, many of them said.

""I think people are blending a lot of different values here related to human rights, privacy, censorship — and it's at risk of getting bundled into a security argument,"" said Karl Grindal, a cybersecurity expert at Georgia Tech.","TikTok is a national security threat, US politicians say.

Abundant rainfall, strong winds and powerful waves mean the island chain's entire electricity demand is already met through renewable resources . But in recent years, Orkney's grid couldn't handle the amount of power being generated from its ever expanding wind farms, Megan McNeill, Orkney projects manager at Community Energy Scotland, told CNN Business.

Wind turbines needed to be switched off on a daily basis, as power cables reached capacity, leaving clean energy unused.

Rather than waste the excess electricity, the islands decided to harness it. It was here that in 2017 the European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC), in a world first, used tidal energy to split water and make hydrogen — a process known as electrolysis.

That was just the beginning. The success of that project spurred collaboration between EMEC, Community Energy Scotland and others to do the same with excess wind energy. Surf 'n' Turf, a project funded by the Scottish government, combined excess electricity from tidal and wind turbines to create hydrogen, another world first.

Hydrogen is viewed as an important part of the transition to a cleaner future because it emits no carbon. It can also be stored and is seen as a potential replacement to natural gas

But traditional hydrogen production relies almost entirely on fossil fuels and is responsible for 830 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions a year. That is equivalent to the CO2 emissions of the United Kingdom and Indonesia combined, according to the International Energy Agency.

Producing hydrogen power remains expensive, but Orkney's success in creating hydrogen using clean energy demonstrates that it can be done at scale. The islands are already using hydrogen to power vehicles, and it will soon be used to heat a local primary school.

Now, Orkney is hoping to use hydrogen fuel cells to power a seagoing vessel able to transport both goods and passengers.

""We're hoping it can be the world first,"" said hydrogen manager at EMEC, Jon Clipshim, adding, ""there is a race on.""

Allie Torgan,"(CNN) When rock band Bon Jovi canceled its summer tour due to the global pandemic, front man Jon Bon Jovi didn't waste a beat turning his focus to those in need in his own backyard.

At his JBJ Soul Kitchen , a non-profit community restaurant in New Jersey, diners pay a cash donation that covers their meal and a meal for someone in need.

But amid earlier Covid-19 restrictions, the restaurant -- run by the Jon Bon Jovi Soul Foundation -- could only remain open for takeout.

Without its regular in-house volunteer base, the kitchen kept operations afloat with the help of the rock star dishwasher.

""There's an in-need population here in New Jersey who depend on us,"" Bon Jovi told CNN in April. ""Hence, the All-Star Hall of Fame dishwasher is back in business.""

Bon Jovi helped out five days a week until just recently, when the restaurant entered phase two and began seating customers per new guidelines.

Over its 13-week takeout period, the restaurant provided more than 7,800 to-go meals to individuals, families, community partners and frontline workers.

At one point, Bon Jovi's wife, Dorothea, took a picture of him washing dishes for social media. It was captioned, ""Do what you can.""

The caption inspired him to pen a song and ask fans around the world to do their part as well.

""The songwriter in me came out, and I wrote the song 'If You Can't Do What You Do, You Do What You Can,'"" he said. ""I knew that people from all walks of life would have their stories to tell, so I invited them to write me a verse.""

From lyrics about missed graduations, fears, togetherness and health, Bon Jovi has been able to hear from and share experiences of fans and musicians around the world.

""It's a great opportunity for me to stay in touch with people around the world and just let them know that I'm thinking of them,"" he said. ""It's a reminder that, even if you can't do what you do, you do what you can.""

Now, as New Jersey enters stage two of its reopening plan, JBJ Soul Kitchen has transitioned back to its pay-it-forward model, continuing to serve delicious meals with dignity.

""Our desire is to make sure that anyone who needs a meal knows that they can come and see us,"" Bon Jovi said, ""and we'll provide them with that nutritious meal.""","From rock superstar to all-star dishwasher, Jon Bon Jovi is keeping his community fed",https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/09/us/bon-jovi-new-jersey-meals-pandemic-cnnheroes/index.html,2020-07-09
Mary Ilyushina,"Norilsk, Russia (CNN) Vasily Ryabinin stands on the banks of the River Daldykan and pushes a long stick into the blood-orange sludge. Raising the stick, he puts a lighter to it and it ignites it like a torch.

""Still burns really well,"" Ryabinin says. ""It's very likely that these puddles are stretching all over the river and will be polluting it for a very long time.""

We were a few kilometers from the Siberian city of Norilsk , where six weeks ago a huge fuel tank at a power plant ruptured, spilling thousands of tons of diesel into the river.

The owner of the plant, the Nornickel metals giant, says the spill was quickly contained, and the damage limited. Ryabinin has sacrificed his job and his family's future in Norilsk in an attempt to lift the lid on what environmentalists have called the worst ecological catastrophe in the polar Arctic.

It was 2 a.m. in the Arctic summer. A half-light illuminated the fast-moving river as it flowed through the endless tundra towards the Arctic ocean. A rainbow film of oil covered the surface; a pool of diesel squelched beneath our feet.

Ryabinin brought us there by foot along railroad tracks. Ever since the spill, the areas surrounding the site have been guarded by security personnel, making them difficult to access.

He is a rare creature in today's Russia -- a whistleblower who quit his job with the state environmental agency Rosprirodnadzor and went public about the extent of the disaster.

Ryabinin says he was first alerted to the scale of the crisis on May 29 by photographs posted on Instagram. He was immediately alarmed: the Daldykan and another river polluted by the spill flow into Lake Pyasino. From there, the contamination could spread all the way to the Arctic Ocean.

Vasily Ryabinin

Just a few hours later he was at the river, taking photographs that would soon provoke a public outcry. He and his boss tried to get in to the Nornickel plant, but he says they were refused entry by police.

More than 20,000 tons of diesel poured into the rivers from the storage tank, according to Nornickel.

Foaming red sludge mixed with the water and sucked life from the rivers and their banks.

""It looked horrible when we got there and it wasn't even the worst of it as a couple of hours had passed,"" Ryabinin says. ""You could smell the diesel half a kilometer away... my boss was even afraid to smoke there in case it blew up.""

What he saw was very different from what officials and media were later reporting: that the spill had swiftly been brought under control. Russian state TV ran reports showing aerial pictures of oil-spill booms guarding the crimson layer of diesel.

""It was such an obvious, childish lie, I couldn't wrap my head around it,"" Ryabinin told CNN.

""Obviously I thought we must at least investigate the lake but my [agency] had a different view, which corresponded with the one of the [Nornickel] plant — that the spill did not spread further that the river.""

Ryabinin says the last straw for him was when Rosprirodnadzor told him to stop looking into the disaster after he had found a helicopter to fly to the lake. At that point, on June 7, he went public, recording a 45-minute account of what he'd found -- concluding that the volume of fuel and speed of the stream must have spread the contamination further.

Rosprirodnadzor did not respond to CNN's request for comment. In an email, Nornickel told CNN that the cleanup of the spill was ongoing, and that the company was ""guided by the official data of Rosprirodnadzor and the Ministry of Emergency Situations,"" as well as satellite imagery that shows ""the borders of the fuel spread.""

A sample collected by Ryabinin on the day of the spill.

A layer of gasoline visible on the surface of the Daldykan River.

Back in Moscow, YouTube blogger and environmentalist Georgy Kavanosyan made the same calculation as Ryabinin.

""All you needed to do is look at the satellite imagery, establish the area of ​​this red spot and divide it by the thousands of tons we were told poured into the water,"" Kavanosyan says. ""And you'd get that the diesel would have to run 50 meters thick to stop there — so that's clearly impossible.""

""They only caught the very tail of this spill and no-one even mentioned what's under the film, state TV kept showing the spill saying there is allegedly nothing under it and it's just on the surface,"" Kavanosyan told CNN. ""And under this layer, hydrocarbons dissolve and infiltrate all life — fish, roe, mud, everything.""

After watching Ryabinin's video, Kavanosyan decided to travel to the region to take independent samples from Lake Pyasino -- and find out whether the pollution had reached the lake.

Norilsk is a difficult place to operate in. It's a remote 'mono-city' where one company and one industry dominate the economy -- enjoying considerable influence as a result. More than 2,800 kilometers northeast of Moscow, the city was founded during Stalin's reign as a site for gulag prisoners. There is no overland connection with the rest of Russia: to get there and back, you have to fly. Foreigners need to get special permission from the Federal Security Agency, or FSB, to get in.

Kavanosyan says he and his cameraman pretended to be on a personal visit and stayed in rented apartments, avoiding main streets. At night they snuck out to the river hoping to find a boat to take them to the lake.

""It was hard, half the people here work for Nornickel and it would've obviously been a risk for them,"" Kavanosyan says.

When they finally reached the lake, they found contamination levels of dissolved hydrocarbons 2.5 higher than officially permissible, Kavanosyan said. He was the only one who managed to take independent samples from that area.

Others were not so lucky. Journalists from Novaya Gazeta said they faced constant harassment from Nornickel guards as they investigated another area with Vasily Ryabinin, finding a place where waste water was being pumped right into the tundra. Nornickel later admitted violations at the tailing pond and suspended local staff. Russia's Investigative Committee launched an investigation into this incident.

Greenpeace Russia also spent two weeks trying to get samples from Lake Pyasino but said the authorities constantly tried to obstruct their work — a police helicopter located them in a forest hut and their boat fuel was confiscated.

A Moscow city lawmaker, who agreed to carry the samples gathered by journalists and Greenpeace activists back to the capital, says he had them confiscated at the local airport last week.

In a video posted by Novaya Gazeta, airport staff said that the airport ""is also Nornickel"" and that taking water samples out required the company's permission.

When asked to comment on these allegations, Nornickel said that ""the emergency regime has been installed at the site and access to many locations is restricted.""

This spill was by no means the first environmental disaster in this part of Siberia, some of whose rivers flow red with toxic waste from factories amid lax environmental regulations. Locals have complained about acidic gases polluting the air; the edges of Norilsk resemble a huge rusting junkyard with dead trees as far as the eye can see.

""Everything is dying here,"" said Andrey, a local driver who did not want to disclose his last name. ""People are mostly concerned about the gas, sometimes it gets so bad we don't let out kids outside.""

But this rare spotlight on the city and Nornickel has prompted the company to provide public explanations, accept full responsibility for the spill and accept the cost of the clean-up. Last week it said that over 90% of fuel from the spill had been collected.

In its preliminary assessment the company blamed melting permafrost for affecting the fuel tank's foundations but said an investigation was still ongoing.

Arctic Russia is indeed warming, and a melting permafrost is potentially devastating for infrastructure in the region. More than 60% of the country's vast land surface is underlain by permafrost . This summer in Norilsk has also been abnormally hot.

But both Kavanosyan and Ryabinin doubt that the tank's sudden collapse was due to climate change. They say Russia has enough experience building on ice and can artificially freeze the ground if needed. They believe it's likely that poor maintenance or lack of oversight are to blame.

The scandal, and Ryabinin's allegations, have also prompted Rostekhnadzor, a state body which oversees the maintenance of industrial infrastructure, to disclose that its specialists had not been able to gain access to the tank at the Nornickel plant for five years.

The spill has even drawn in President Vladimir Putin, who chaired a televised meeting with the head of Nornickel, Vladimir Potanin, in early June. Potanin said the company expects to pay about $140 million to cover the damages.

""One vessel that contained the fuel costs much less, incomparably less,"" Putin replied. ""I'm saying that if you had changed that one tank on time there wouldn't have been any damage to nature, and the company wouldn't have to cover such expenses.""

Beyond the rare public spotlight on an environmental issue in Russia, the Nornickel spill has provided an even rarer example of dissent and protest winning out in Russia. Weeks after the findings by Ryabinin and Kavanosyan, the state agency Rosprirodnadzor admitted that Lake Pyasino had been contaminated.

On Wednesday it estimated the damage to be 14 times greater than Nornickel's initial assessment and asked it to pay a record $2 billion in compensation.

The company disputed the assessment, saying the agency had based its calculations ""on principles that have distorted the results and need to be adjusted."" It also added that it remains committed to its obligation to eliminate the consequences of the spill at their own expense.

Kavanosyan called Rosprirodnadzor's action ""revolutionary"" and said it sent a signal to all enterprises that choose to ""dump waste into rivers and lakes and save on wastewater treatment plants.""

As for Ryabinin, he is preparing to leave Norilsk and move his family somewhere else.

""This is quite sad because I really love my city, the North and I don't want to leave,"" he said. ""But I did this knowing that I will not be able to live and work here after all of this.""",The Russian whistleblower risking it all to expose the scale of an Arctic oil spill catastrophe,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/10/europe/arctic-oil-spill-russia-whistleblower-intl/index.html,2020-07-10
Rob Picheta,"London (CNN) The director-general of the World Health Organization has condemned a ""lack of leadership"" in fighting the coronavirus pandemic and made an emotional plea for global unity, as cases soar in multiple countries and the world struggles to contain the devastating virus more than six months after it was first identified.

His intervention will be seen as a thinly veiled swipe at leaders including US President Donald Trump, who has waged a public battle against WHO while failing to suppress the world's worst Covid-19 outbreak in his own country.

Jessie Yeung,"Hong Kong (CNN) When Marta came to Hong Kong in 2011, she was a 29-year-old single mother, looking for a job that could support her young daughter and sick father back in the Philippines.

Foreign domestic workers, she knew, often earn much higher salaries than she could find at home. Before she arrived, a recruitment agency found her a job as a helper -- a job that entails being a housekeeper, personal chef, nanny and caretaker.

And like nearly all helpers in Hong Kong, she was legally required to live in her employer's home.

What she said followed were six months of physical and emotional abuse so excruciating that she broke her contract and fled. ""All my body died for him,"" says Marta, now 37, who requested a pseudonym to protect her identity. ""He is the dark in my life.""

The mistreatment Marta describes is not uncommon in Hong Kong, home to more than 390,000 helpers who largely come from the Philippines and Indonesia.

Making up nearly 10% of the city's labor force, these women -- only about 1% of helpers are men -- are integral to Hong Kong's economy and daily life. Yet they are also one of the city's most vulnerable communities.

In a survey of 5,023 helpers last year, 15% of respondents said they had been physically abused during employment. And 2% reported being sexually assaulted or harassed, according to advocacy organization Mission For Migrant Workers (MFMW), which ran the survey.

Issues of poor working and living conditions are common complaints.

Activists say the live-in rule, which is only waived by the government in exceptional circumstances, forces women to reside with potentially abusive employers with few avenues for help.

After Marta left her first employer, she said she faced periods of homelessness and unemployment -- at one point sleeping on a mattress on the floor of her church -- before finding a new job.

Now, back on her feet, she's pushing to change the live-in rule -- by taking it to court.

A quick history

Foreign domestic workers began coming to Hong Kong in the 1970s, a decade of rapid economic development that saw the city transform from a poor manufacturing hub to a financial capital with modern urban infrastructure.

Hong Kong's Security Bureau. Local women wanted to join the workforce, and opening up work visas to helpers ""relieved housewives from household chores for taking up employment,"" according to a 2005 report byHong Kong's Security Bureau.

Helpers are typically in charge of cleaning their employers' households, buying groceries, cooking meals, caring for children and the elderly, and a range of other essential tasks.

For several decades, some helpers lived with their employers while others opted to live out -- but in 2003, the authorities made the live-in rule mandatory. They claimed doing so would ""better reflect the policy intention"" behind bringing in foreign workers -- to fill a shortage in full-time, live-in domestic services, especially crucial for those who need around-the-clock care like people with disabilities or elderly residents living alone.

There's no such shortage for part-time or non live-in services, so allowing foreign workers to live-out would put them in direct competition with local workers, the government argued.

The rule dictated that employers provide ""suitable accommodation"" with ""reasonable privacy,"" but offered few other guidelines. Employers are required to disclose the size of their apartment and the type of accommodation for the helper -- for instance, a private room or a partitioned area of the home -- on the employment contract , which is then signed off by the helper.

But there are no standards or requirements for how much minimum space helpers should be given, and the vague wording of ""suitable"" means some are made to sleep in poor conditions, like in the bathroom or on the floor.

If a helper breaks the rule by living out, they face a ban from working in Hong Kong -- and the employer could be banned from hiring helpers. They could even be prosecuted for providing false information, punishable by imprisonment or a heavy fine.

No privacy, no rest

Since its introduction, the rule has attracted critics, who say it exacerbates the challenges helpers already face in their demanding roles.

For instance, Hong Kong has long struggled with limited residential space and high housing prices. Many families live in cramped apartments with barely space for their families, let alone for helpers.

In this environment, helpers often complain about long hours, a lack of privacy, and uncomfortable sleeping arrangements. There's also the risk of abuse from their employers; when that happens, leaving a job is rarely an option. Doing so would threaten their visa status, employment, and ability to support their families.

Dolores Balladares, a 50-year-old from the Philippines, arrived in Hong Kong when she was 25.

She says that in her first job, she didn't have her own room. Instead, her employer set up flimsy privacy curtains, similar to those used around hospital beds, around the sofa in the living room. At the end of her work day, Balladares would draw the curtains around herself and struggle to sleep.

Her employers and their children would still be watching television just feet away in the same room.

""It was so demeaning,"" Balladares said of that first job.

Furthermore, living in means there is no real differentiation between many helpers' workspace and personal living space: it's all the same household. Work-life boundaries can dissolve entirely, especially since there are no laws around maximum working hours per day or week.

Balladares said she often worked more than 12 hours a day, sometimes waking at 5 a.m. and not sleeping until nearly 1 a.m.

""It was a family of five, the parents were both working and the children were all studying, so I did everything,"" she said. ""From preparing breakfast to bringing the kids to the school bus, then going to the market, ironing, teaching the children their homework, cleaning the house, and doing the cooking before I sleep at night.""

Though the law mandates helpers must be given a full 24-hour rest day each week, that's often not the case. On her off days, Balladares says she would still be asked to clean the family cars before leaving to meet her friends -- and she was told to be home by 8 p.m. so she could clean dishes and help bathe the children.

In the MFMW survey, more than half of respondents said that, like Balladares, they didn't have their own rooms, and instead had ""alternative sleeping arrangements."" Often helpers share a bunk bed with one of the family's children.

More than half said they worked between 11 and 16 hours per day, while 44% said they worked more than 16 hours. Nearly half said they were asked to work during their rest days. Another 29% said they weren't given enough food, which an employer is legally required to supply, or given an allowance for it.

Choosing between safety and income

Many helpers who face these conditions, or physical and sexual abuse, are often reluctant to report it to authorities for fear of jeopardizing their livelihoods. Taking legal action would be financially and emotionally draining, and could potentially deter future employers -- not an easy risk to take when you have family members back home to support.

If helpers leave their jobs before their two-year contract is up, they have 14 days to find a new job -- or they must leave Hong Kong, unless they have ""exceptional approval,"" according to a guide by the Immigration Department.

Numerous global humanitarian organizations, including Amnesty International and the United Nations Human Rights Committee , have called on the Hong Kong government to repeal this 14-day rule, arguing it discourages helpers from leaving abusive or exploitative situations.

""The issue here is that the (live-in) rule renders them vulnerable,"" said Karen Ng, a case manager at the non-profit organization HELP for Domestic Workers. ""It's forcing the worker to choose between their safety and making an income to support their families.""

Even if helpers do speak out, they often don't have enough evidence for police to help them, Ng added -- when they live in, the only witnesses are the employers' family members.

The most notorious case of helper abuse captured the city's attention in 2015, when Hong Kong housewife Law Wan-tung was found guilty of abusing her helper, Erwiana Sulistyaningsih, a 23-year-old woman from Indonesia.

Law regularly beat Erwiana with mop handles and coat hangers, and forced her to sleep on the floor, for only five hours a night. Erwiana was only given meager rations of food, and warned that her parents would be killed if she told anyone.

Former Indonesian domestic worker Erwiana Sulistyaningsih speaks during an event in Hong Kong on March 27, 2016.

During Erwiana's trial, Law's two children, who lived in the flat during the abuse, provided no evidence against their mother. One testified that she was ""gentle"" to the helpers.

Though Law was sentenced to prison for six years, no systemic change followed.

In a report released later that year, the government said changing the live-in rule would strain the city's housing and public transit systems, and would ""go against the rationale for importing FDHs and the fundamental policy that local employees (including local domestic helpers) should enjoy priority in employment.""

A year later, Marta filed her legal challenge against the rule.

The fight to change the rule

In 2016, Marta applied for a judicial review, arguing the live-in rule was discriminatory and raised the risk of violating helpers' fundamental rights.

Helpers just want the option to live out, she and other activists argue -- and not all of them would necessarily take it. Many helpers who have good working relationships with their employers appreciate the cost-saving element of living in, which allows them to send more money home to family.

Some employers also favor having an option if they don't feel comfortable inviting a stranger to live in their home.

In such cases, some employers agree to pay for their helpers to live in illegal boarding houses, which offer shared rooms and common areas. Helpers get their own space, privacy, and more control over their working hours -- but also face heightened risk, as police occasionally conduct raids.

""I want freedom -- the freedom to choose,"" Marta said. ""Why not try to get freedom for both the employer and employee?""

But her first challenge failed. In 2018, the judge dismissed the case and upheld the rule, arguing that in instances of mistreatment, the problem was the bad employer -- not the fact the helper lived in the same household.

There was ""no sufficient evidence"" that the live-in rule significantly raised the risk of violating fundamental rights, or that the rule directly caused abuse, the judge wrote.

The government praised the dismissal, adding in a statement that helpers could ""terminate the contract any time"" if they didn't want to live with their employers.

The statement didn't mention the 14-day rule, or the fact many helpers who leave their contracts legally have to return to their home nations, before reapplying for a job and visa all over again.

The government's response sparked anger among helpers and activists.

""We should not think of domestic workers as throwaways -- 'you don't like the terms, don't come,'"" said Ng. ""They're contributing a lot toward society, so why can't we see them that way? We should take into consideration that they have rights, they have needs.""

Marta is now living with a new employer who she says treats her well, respects her working hours, and provides her with her own room. She has found a caring community in her church and is working to heal -- but says she's still fighting the rule.

She has appealed the judgment and is waiting for the court to release its decision. It's not clear when the judgment will come.

""If the employer is nice, that's fine -- but how about the helpers who have no food, no room and no rest, then no option and no freedom?"" she said.

""I am not just fighting for myself but fighting for others. I am thinking about other people -- for them to have an option.""",Domestic helpers in Hong Kong: Where hundreds of thousands of women have to live with their boss,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/09/asia/hong-kong-helper-live-in-rule-intl-hnk/index.html,2020-07-09
Rodrigo Pedroso,"(CNN) As Brazil's coronavirus cases surge by the tens of thousands each day, the country is contending with a parallel outbreak -- a flurry of corruption investigations into the alleged misuse of public money rapidly shelled out for Covid-19 emergency procurement.

The investigations have reached all levels of government, including three state governors who have come under federal scrutiny in the past two months. Nearly 1,500 federal criminal judicial proceedings have also been opened into coronavirus-related cases, including investigations into misuse of federal funds, fraud, overpricing, and money laundering, according to a summary the federal prosecution office shared with CNN. The data provided to CNN does not specify what portion of the probes relate to corruption.

Meanwhile, cases of coronavirus are soaring across Brazil , and the healthcare system in several states has been stretched to its limit. Brazil is second only to the United States in the number of infections and deaths, and on Tuesday, bombastic president Jair Bolsonaro was also diagnosed with Covid-19.

State-level investigations

On the state level, investigations into Covid-19 emergency purchases have been reported in at least 11 of Brazil's 26 states and the federal district, according to the Federal Police. At least seven high-ranking state health officials have been fired or resigned during the pandemic.

Two health officials in Rio de Janeiro were arrested in a probe known as ""Operation Merchants of Chaos,"" into an alleged scheme to pilfer millions of dollars from a contract for ventilators that federal authorities say were never delivered.

In São Paulo, Brazil's most populous state and the epicenter of the country's coronavirus outbreak, a large purchase of imported ventilators is under investigation.

State prosecutors and an accountability court are reviewing a $100 million contract signed by the state government at the beginning of the pandemic for some 3,000 ventilators from China. Sao Paulo officials paid as much as $40,000 each for some ventilators, while the cheapest were bought for $20,000, according to the Brazilian Office of the Comptroller General, which notes that the average price per ventilator paid across Brazil is around $16,000.

The state government has said the purchases complied with legal requirements. But in June, the state canceled the contract after receiving only a small number of the ventilators. Attorneys for the São Paulo state government have filed a lawsuit against the middleman company seeking a refund and fines for the unfulfilled delivery. It was a highly publicized debacle for São Paulo's government, which is listed in the middle of a ranking published by Transparency International Brazil of states' transparency in Covid-19 emergency contracting.

Globally, the rush to obtain urgent medical supplies has led to hastily negotiated contracts and sometimes exorbitant prices. Spiking demand for medical equipment has also forced legitimate costs up as suppliers ramp up production and compete for raw materials.

Expeditious emergency contracting is useful in order to meet the need of the pandemic, acknowledges Guilherme France, research coordinator for Transparency International Brazil -- however, doing so ""also implies a loosening of controls that exist precisely in order to prevent corruption.""

He says that the frenzied circumstances of the pandemic have opened the door to abuses. ""In this moment of inflated prices and limited offer, opportunistic businesses arise to take advantage of these vulnerabilities and to increase profits in an unscrupulous way,"" he said.

Federal investigations across the country

On the federal level, probes into suspected misuse of federal funds have touched officials across the country, from a mayor and city officials in the remote northern Amapá to the governors of the Amazonian states of Pará and Amazonas and down to the southeastern beaches of Rio de Janeiro.

Federal agents searched the home of Amazonas Gov. Wilson Lima in late June as part of an investigation into an alleged no-bid contract for the purchase of ventilators by the state government from a wine importer in the capital Manaus. Lima has denied any wrongdoing. ""I am absolutely calm and am certain that these facts will soon be clarified,"" he said

In the state of Pará, federal agents searched the home of Gov. Helder Barbalho, who is suspected of involvement in a ventilator contract that delivered equipment with glaring technical defects, such as the lack of an internal battery which means it could shut off if power went out, flaws in the breathing cycle that could cause lung damage and problems with the machine's ability to be cleaned and sterilized.

Federal prosecutors allege that Barbalho was aware of the flaws in the equipment and had a close relationship with a businessman who brokered the sale. But the governor has denied any wrongdoing. ""I clarify that I am not a friend of the businessman [involved in the sale] and, obviously, I did not know that the ventilators would not work,"" Barbalho wrote on Twitter in early June.

In Rio de Janeiro, Gov. Wilson Witzel had his cell phones and computers seized by federal agents who entered his official residence on May 26 as part of a probe investigators dubbed ""Operation Placebo"" into alleged embezzlement of public health funds. Rio state lawmakers, responding to the federal investigation, have now launched an impeachment investigation of Witzel over Covid-19 procurement, including allegations of graft in a purchase of ventilators and a contract to build f ield hospitals. Witzel has denied any wrongdoing.

The investigations into the three governors are ongoing and no charges have been made against them.

However, the probes have already deprived Witzel's government of the high-ranking health officials who would have otherwise led Rio de Janeiro through its pandemic response. Fernando Ferry, Rio de Janeiro's health secretary for a matter of weeks, resigned his post in late June after three other top state health officials had lost or quit their jobs amid wrongdoing and corruption accusations during the pandemic. His resignation came a week after federal agents indicted 17 people in Rio de Janeiro, including a former state lawmaker, for alleged involvement in a scheme to misappropriate funds meant to be spent on medical equipment.

Ferry later testified to lawmakers on an oversight committee probing public health expenditures during the pandemic that he feared ""dirtying"" his personal record. He told Brazil's TV Record: ""In order to make the machine work, I would have to sign off on things without being covered by a contract. And this legal imbroglio would spill over to my CPF,"" a reference to a Brazilian identification number that tracks one's creditworthiness.

'You could have saved more lives and helped more people if resources were not diverted'

President Bolsonaro rose to power promising to clean up corruption and to change ""all that is there, "" as he frequently said on the campaign trail. But France, from Transparency International, says that Bolsonaro's performance before and during the pandemic is hardly fulfilling the anti-corruption rhetoric that drew voters.

""Now, after a year and a half of governing, the Bolsonaro administration is responsible for a series of setbacks in the fight against corruption,"" France said. Those setbacks include instances of blatant political interference in institutions responsible for fighting corruption, such as the Federal Police, the Federal Prosecution Office, and the Council for Financial Activities Control.

In April, Bolsonaro replaced Justice Minister Sergio Moro with an ally, André Mendonça, who in turn named a new head of the Federal Police. This comes as two of Bolsonaros sons are under investigation for alleged wrongdoing unrelated to the pandemic.

Christian Lynch, political scientist and professor at Rio de Janeiro State University, says local corruption scandals and investigations could prove beneficial to Bolsonaro politically, as he outsources the responsibility of handling the pandemic.

""The scandals that appeared in Rio de Janeiro and Pará, states whose governors were the opposition, were very useful because they associated the independence of their opponents from the federal government with corruption,"" he said.

The country's flurry of corruption investigations come amid crushing poverty and unemployment in the country, as the pandemic caps off years of economic decline . According to a new projection from the International Monetary Fund, Brazilian GDP is expected to shrink 9.1% this year.

For Micaella Melo de Paula, a respiratory physiotherapist in a Rio de Janeiro public hospital who intubates Covid-19 patients, the allegations of misused funds and backroom deals are an indignity. Employees at the hospital where she works went unpaid for more than a month during the pandemic, the Rio de Janeiro state health secretariat has confirmed to CNN. A probe is now underway in order to settle payments. Melo de Paula herself says she is owed more than a thousand dollars in unpaid wages from work during the pandemic.

""But it gives you a feeling of impotence and anger to know that you could have saved more lives and helped more people if resources were not diverted, if supplies were not overpriced,"" she said.

""The pandemic comes to expose all these dirty politics and its schemes -- and we are the ones who are the frontline suffering from their actions.""",Brazil coronavirus: Cases explode while country investigates corruption,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/08/americas/brazil-coronavirus-corruption-intl/index.html,2020-07-08
Analysis Cnn'S Matt Rivers,"Mexico City (CNN) If you're not a close follower of US-Mexico relations, you might be forgiven for assuming President Donald Trump and Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador wouldn't get along.

The two share a famously contentious border. Demonizing people on the Mexican side of it has long been a key part of the Trump political playbook, while López Obrador -- known as AMLO in Mexico -- has accused Trump of inciting racism. But when the two men meet this week to celebrate the implementation of the United States-Mexico-Capnada Agreement (USMCA) trade deal , expect smiles all around.

This is the first time Mexico's President has left the country since taking office in December of 2018. The fact that he's headed to the White House speaks volumes, both practically and symbolically. Both leaders are looking for victories beyond their losing battles with the coronavirus pandemic.

Trump said last month that López Obrador was ""a really great guy,"" and López Obrador said he was going to Washington, DC, ""to thank Trump for his support and solidarity."" They still have plenty to disagree over, but there also seems to be a lot of common ground -- not the least of which could be their similar governing styles as two populists who've built political brands on a cult of personality.

Showing off the USMCA

Their meeting centers on the USMCA, a deal that passed after months of difficult negotiations.

The timing of the meeting amid the rampant spread of the coronavirus in both countries has questioned by critics. But for two men who've seen their approval ratings consistently drop during the outbreak, the meeting presents an opportunity to talk about something else.

""Right now, neither is getting high marks for their handling of the health crisis, making the visit a welcome distraction,"" said Christopher Wilson, deputy director of the Wilson Center's Mexico Institute.

The USMCA's implementation represents one of the biggest foreign policy wins of the Trump administration — and arguably one of the only major examples of the President creating new, lasting agreements with foreign countries rather than tearing up existing ones.

Trump will promote this deal as a win and a follow-through on a 2016 campaign promise to rework previous free trade deals, even as Democrats say the only reason they voted to pass the USMCA is because they overhauled the original framework during negotiations.

""López Obrador's visit will allow [Trump] to showcase how he has bent Mexico to his will by reminding voters that this is a 'very good deal' for the US while signaling his achievements at strong-arming Mexico on immigration policies,"" said Gladys McCormick, an expert on US-Mexico affairs at Syracuse University.

Meanwhile, López Obrador has also staked a lot of political capital in the USMCA and likely wants to make sure the Trump administration is invested in ironing out any issues that arise during its implementation.

Mexico's economy was sputtering even before the pandemic hit. Now, with the IMF predicting a 10.5% GDP contraction in 2020 and his party facing critical midterm elections next summer, shoring up Mexico's most important economic relationship is probably top of mind for López Obrador.

""Almost 85%of all [Mexican] exports go to the [United States], which is obviously a huge number,"" said Larry Rubin, president of the American Society of Mexico. ""Mexico is highly dependent on trade with the United States.""

""Mexico will benefit more by sending very clear and positive messages that if investors want to come and invest in Mexico, their investment will be protected,"" Rubin said.

A calculated strategy for AMLO

Critics of the Mexican President have urged him not to travel to the White House, saying it follows a trend of AMLO wilting in the face of Trump's economic bullying and racist rhetoric.

Consider that in 2019, when Trump expressed anger over the flow of Central American migrants traveling to the US border through Mexico, he threatened tariffs on Mexican imports if Mexico didn't crack down.

López Obrador quickly complied. He deployed Mexico's National Guard, a newly created force supposedly dedicated to fighting Mexico's horrific levels of violence, to the northern and southern borders, significantly slowing migrant flows.

Critics have said that while Trump's vaunted border wall hasn't actually been built or paid for by Mexico as Trump promised, AMLO's National Guard deployment essentially did just that.

AMLO also signed onto the so-called Remain in Mexico policy, under which the Trump administration forces asylum seekers to wait in Mexico while their paperwork is processed, exposing them to dangerous conditions in Mexican border cities where levels of violence are sky high.

AMLO has also largely refrained from criticizing the provocative language sometimes used by Trump and his supporters when describing people crossing from Mexico into the United States.

""How do you stop these people?"" Trump asked of immigrants at a May 2019 rally in Florida. When an audience member shouted, ""Shoot them!"" Trump smiled and said, ""Only in the [Florida] Panhandle can you get away with a statement like that."" The exchange continues to be referenced in Mexican political commentary today.

AMLO agreed to step up his country's immigration enforcement just a few weeks later.

""We Mexican democrats will not forget Mr. López Obrador's reverence to the man who has maligned us,"" wrote Mexican historian Enrique Krauze this week in a New York Times op-ed.

But López Obrador's approach to the United States is a calculated one. Next to nothing should get in the way of Mexico capitalizing on its relationship with the world's largest economic power. Some might call it appeasement. Others call it smart.

""If we have a good relationship with the US, we will avoid bad treatments, and we've accomplished this,"" he said in his daily press conference on Monday. ""My critics say, 'How am I going to the US if they have offended the Mexicans?'I want to tell the people of my country that since we took office, there's been a respectful relationship, not only to the Mexican government but also to the Mexicans.""

""Notwithstanding some of President Trump's derogatory remarks about Mexico and Mexicans, President López Obrador is placing Mexican national interest first and conducting himself like a statesman,"" said Armand Peschard-Sverdrup, a senior associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

Whatever the strategy, it has led to the US President taking a kind view of López Obrador, with Trump even tweeting in June of 2019, ""Mexico is doing a far better job than the Democrats on the border. Thank you Mexico!""

Two sides of the same coin?

And although the two presidents come from very different political backgrounds — Trump the right-wing former television star, AMLO the decades-long politician, self-declared leftist and former mayor of Mexico City — experts note they have very similar approaches to governing.

""Both presidents are populists and economic nationalists,"" said Wilson. ""Both came to power on a message of empowering the disenchanted and disaffected. Both see institutions and bureaucracy as unnecessary checks on their power and obstacles in their direct relationship with voters.""

And the presidents have taken a remarkably similar track in their handling of the coronavirus pandemic.

Both presidents downplayed the initial threat. Trump promised back in February it would just disappear while AMLO famously held up two amulets and said, while smiling, that they would ""protect"" him from the virus.

They also routinely ignore public health experts' advice to socially distance and wear masks in public, and neither man is in favor of mass testing.

Most crucially, Trump and AMLO are both aggressively pushing for their economies to reopen. So perhaps it's no surprise that, of all the reasons to meet, they would find time this week to tout a new economic deal.",Why Trump? Why now?

Bill Weir,"São Paulo, Brazil (CNN) Adenilson Costa has worked at the Vila Formosa graveyard for a quarter of a century and he says he has never seen the fresh graves fill up so fast.

It's the largest cemetery in Latin America, but since coronavirus came to Brazil , it isn't big enough.

Gravedigger Adenilson Costa says he is shocked and saddened by what he sees at work every day.

Families are hustled through funerals, Costa said, each given no more than 10 or 15 minutes to say goodbye so the cemetery can manage up to 80 burials a day at this site on the outskirts of São Paulo.

""That makes us very shocked, very sad, because it is the last greeting they will give to the loved one that they lost and they do not have time,"" Costa said.

There are so many burials at Vila Formasa these days, that families are restricted to just a few minutes to say their final goodbyes.

He spoke on a momentous day for Brazil -- a day when the Health Ministry announced more than 45,000 new cases of Covid-19 in the country, one of them the President, Jair Bolsonaro

Bolsonaro has spent months downplaying the spread of the lethal virus, even as Brazil became the country with the second-most cases -- and deaths -- behind only the United States.

And while gravedigger Costa is shocked by the rate of death, Bolsonaro told many of his citizens they had nothing to worry about, as he announced he himself had the virus.

Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro wore a mask when he told reporters about his coronavirus diagnosis.

""Younger people: take care, but if you are affected by the virus, rest assured that, for you, the possibility of something more serious is close to zero,"" the President said.

Bolsonaro acknowledged the risk was higher for those, like himself, over the age of 65. But he told reporters he felt fine, and gave much of the credit to hydroxychloroquine, the malaria drug first pushed controversially by US President Donald Trump then stockpiled by Bolsonaro but unproven as a treatment for Covid-19

Bolsonaro told CNN Brasil that he took both hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin while he awaited the result of his fourth Covid-19 test in four months.

""I am feeling very well. I believe that the way they administered the hydroxychloroquine on, the effect was immediate,"" he said.

Bolsonaro's touting of hydroxychloroquine worries Dr. Luiz Henrique Mandetta, Brazil's former health minister.

Former health minister Luiz Henrique Mandetta, at right in this photo from March, disagreed with President Jair Bolsonaro, left, over how to tackle the coronavirus pandemic.

""So he pretends that this medicine would save 90% of people's lives. It is not the medicine. It's just the way the disease goes,"" Mandetta said.

""The problem is that people are going to believe that,"" he added. ""His message could be a disaster in a country that has so many people that really listen more to messages than read about things.""

Mandetta said he and other ministers tried to warn Bolsonaro to take the pandemic seriously and make a national plan to tackle it. But they were not heeded.

""He [Bolsonaro] always said that he would, he was more worried about the damage in the economy than damage to people's lives,"" Mandetta said.

A backhoe has been brought in to dig more graves at the Vila Formosa cemetery in São Paulo.

Mandetta says he hopes the President gets well but also hopes he thinks of all the other Brazilians who got a positive Covid test result on the same day as Bolsonaro.

""I just hope that he can think about the other people that have a diagnostic on the same day as he did,"" he said. ""The people that received the test today are going home, not to the place where he lives with a personal physician 24 hours a day, ... plenty of people ... and all the equipment.""",Gravedigger takes Covid-19 more seriously than Brazil's President,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/07/americas/brazil-coronavirus-bolsonaro-gravedigger-weir/index.html,2020-07-07
Marcia Reverdosa,"Bolsonaro himself announced the result, speaking on Brazilian TV channels Tuesday. ""Everyone knew that it would reach a considerable part of the population sooner or later. It was positive for me,"" he said, referring to the Covid-19 test he took Monday.

""On Sunday, I wasn't feeling very well. On Monday, it got worse when I started feeling tired and some muscle pain. I also had a 38-degree [Celsius] fever. Given those symptoms, the presidential doctor said there was suspicion of Covid-19,"" Bolsonaro said, adding that he then went to hospital to receive a lung scan.

He said that his wife, First Lady Michelle Bolsonaro was also tested.

In an interview with CNN Brasil following his diagnosis, Bolsonaro said he would steer clear of in-person meetings in the near future. ""I'm not going to see anyone for meetings. Everything will be done via video conference and I will rarely meet people if I need to deal with more reserved matter,"" he said.

He also acknowledged the grave risk posed by a virus that he has in the past dismissed as just a ""little flu."" ""We know the fatality of the virus for those of a certain age, like me, above 65, as well as for those with comorbidities, diseases, other issues. In those cases, the virus could be decisive and lead to death -- everyone knew that,"" he said.

Bolsonaro previously reassured supporters on Monday that his lungs were ""clean,"" after being tested. Wearing a mask, he warned them to not get near him.

""You can't get very close [to me], OK? Recommendation for everyone,"" he said.

'I thought I had contracted it already'

Brazil is second only to the United States in numbers of coronavirus infections and deaths. But Bolsonaro has often appeared in public and at rallies without a face mask, even hugging supporters.

""I have to admit, I thought I had gotten it earlier, considering my very dynamic activity in the face of the people,"" he said on Tuesday. ""And I can tell you more, I am the President and I am on the front line, I don't run away from my responsibility nor do I shy away from the people.""

""Because of my contact with the people, I thought I had contracted it already and not noticed it, like the majority of the Brazilian population that contracts the virus, and doesn't know,"" he continued.

More than 65,000 people have now died of the virus in Brazil, according to figures released by the country's health ministry on Monday. So far, 1,623,284 cases have been confirmed. With coronavirus tests hard to come by in the country, some local experts say the real number of people infected could be 12 to 16 times higher.

The Brazilian leader struck a defiant note during his interview with CNN Brasil, defending his government's management of the pandemic.

""No country in the world has managed to prevent deaths,"" he said. ""The whole world was unanimous in saying that the purpose of the isolation measures... was not to prevent people from contracting the virus but that the contraction was inevitable and it should happen over a longer time for hospitals to be equipped with ICU beds and respirators.""

Bolsonaro has long maintained that lockdowns will hurt the country more than the virus itself. ""Our life has to go on. Jobs should be maintained,"" he said during a March 24 speech broadcast on national television and radio.

He held onto that position as Brazil's outbreak dramatically worsened, criticizing governors and mayors for introducing stringent lockdown measures in an attempt to curb cases.

Bolsonaro greets supporters upon arrival at Planalto Palace in Brasilia, on May 24, 2020, amid the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic.

Local targets of his ire included the mayor of Manaus Virgílio Neto, to whom Bolsonaro referred as a ""piece of shit"" for digging mass graves in his city during the pandemic. Neto is now being treated for Covid-19 at a prominent São Paulo hospital, according to a statement from his office.

During a Facebook Live session last month, Bolsonaro also implied that local politicians might be inflating the number of deaths from coronavirus in order to make the federal government response look bad. ""No one lost their life, in most cases, due to the lack of ICU beds or ventilators,"" Bolsonaro said, calling on citizens to enter hospitals to check ""if the beds are occupied or not.""

Following his diagnosis on Tuesday, Bolsonaro emphasized that mayors and governors were responsible for the handling of the pandemic. ""If it is going well or is going badly, it is a responsibility of governors and mayors, according to a decision of the Supreme Court,"" he told CNN Brasil.

Like US President Donald Trump, Bolsonaro has boosted anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine as a potential treatment for the virus, though it has not been consistently proven effective and the World Health Organization (WHO) has discontinued a major trial with the drug.

Bolsonaro told CNN Brasil on Tuesday that he took both hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin while he awaited the result of his fourth Covid-19 test in four months, and credited the controversial drug for his well-being.

""I am feeling very well. I believe that the way they administered the hydroxychloroquine on, the effect was immediate,"" he said.

The WHO on Tuesday wished Bolsonaro a ""speedy recovery."" ""It's very important to understand the seriousness of this virus and to be really serious,"" noted WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus at a press briefing in Geneva.

""No country is immune, and no country is safe, and no individual can be safe.""

Contact-tracing the president

Bolsonaro has previously tested negative for coronavirus in at least three separate examinations. Those tests were administered between March 12 and March 17, after Bolsonaro returned from a bilateral meeting with US President Donald Trump in Florida and many in his entourage tested positive.

This week's positive result comes just days after he attended a July 4th commemoration event with the US Ambassador to Brazil, Todd Chapman. According to a photo posted to the President's official Facebook page , Bolsonaro was at the Ambassador's residence with Chapman for the event.

Images from the gathering show Bolsonaro not wearing a mask or observing social distancing. In one picture, he stands next to several US and Brazilian officials, including Chapman, and Brazil's foreign minister, Ernesto Araújo. Chapman and his wife have Janetta Chapman have since tested negative for Covid-19, according to a statement tweeted by the US Embassy in Brazil.

Despite his diagnosis, Bolsonaro on Tuesday emphasized that his priority is still to restart Brazil's lagging economy. ""I know that nobody can recover from dying, but the economy not working leads to other causes of death and suicide,"" he said. ""We have suffered very harsh criticism in this regard, but today it shows that we are right. The fact that I am infected shows that I am a human being like any other.""

At the end of his comments, Bolsonaro stepped back and removed his mask. ""I'll get away a little. Just so you all can see my face. I'm fine, I'm fine, thank God. Everything is ok,"" he said. ""Thank you to those who prayed for me. Those who criticized, no problem, they can continue to criticize if they want. After all, we preserve the freedom of speech and understand it as one of the pillars of our democracy.""

He then resumed the assurances that have become a hallmark of his attitude toward the virus, ""So let's take special care of the elderly, of course. Younger people: take care, but if you are affected by the virus, be assured that for you, the possibility of something more serious is close to zero.""",Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro tests positive for Covid-19 after months of dismissing the seriousness of the virus,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/07/americas/brazil-bolsonaro-positive-coronavirus-intl/index.html,2020-07-07
Kevin Liptak,"As the coronavirus pandemic kept barbershops closed to customers, his tidy trim grew into a wave that evolved eventually into a mop with bangs. For some, the mane came to embody the shared sacrifices that Trudeau -- quarantined at his home in Ottawa -- was asking fellow Canadians to endure to stop the spread of coronavirus.

Things progressed differently 450 miles south in Washington.

On Wednesday, the differences in the two approaches will be front and center as Trump marks the official beginning of the new North American trade agreement that is a signature achievement for all three participating governments: the United States, Mexico and Canada.

While Mexico's President accepted Trump's invitation to participate in the ceremony, Trudeau did not.

""We wish the United States and Mexico well at Wednesday's meeting,"" the prime minister's office said. ""While there were recent discussions about the possible participation of Canada, the Prime Minister will be in Ottawa this week for scheduled Cabinet meetings and the long-planned sitting of Parliament.""

Last week, Trudeau himself said he was still in discussions about whether a trip to the United States ""makes sense,"" saying while he was troubled by the threat of new US tariffs on steel and aluminum, ""we're also concerned about the health situation and the coronavirus reality that is still hitting all three of our countries.""

Canadian perspective

JUST WATCHED See how Canada crushed the curve while the US struggles Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH See how Canada crushed the curve while the US struggles 03:03

Trudeau's decision to forgo travel to Washington comes as Trump's attempts to diminish or deny the health crisis are causing his political standing to crater -- which, in turn, has caused Trump to retrench in racist politics and culture wars . Earlier this month, when Trudeau was asked about the violent dispersal of peaceful protesters outside the White House after which Trump staged a photo-op near a church, the prime minister responded with an uncomfortable 20-second pause before saying he was watching the situation with ""horror and consternation.""

Given a chance this week to participate in his own photo-op with Trump, Trudeau declined -- a decision hard to imagine earlier in Trump's tenure, when world leaders flocked to the White House for obvious shows of flattery.

The sense among many officials at the Canadian embassy in Washington is that Trudeau has chosen to buy time and deal with Trump as infrequently as possible until the US general election in November, one senior Canadian official said. Trudeau, who has faced his own share of political problems in Canada, is trying to focus his energy now on the domestic response to coronavirus, instead of getting dragged in to the White House photo-op in a country now grappling with record-high coronavirus cases, this person said.

The decision to skip the event in Washington is the second time Trudeau has balked at the prospect of crossing the still-closed US-Canada border for a meeting with Trump; after the President floated an in-person meeting of the G7 to be convened in June, the prime minister (along with most other G7 leaders) said he'd only consider it if proper safety measures were in place.

Rushing to Washington now, as cases again surge in the United States, would also put Trudeau at risk of violating the very guidelines he was worked arduously to model himself as his country weathers the global health crisis. The border between the two countries remains closed except for essential travel, a status many Canadians support maintaining as cases spike in the United States.

When his wife tested positive for Covid-19 in March, Trudeau entered self-quarantine at Rideau Cottage, his official brick Georgian revival residence in Ottawa, where he solo-parented his three children while also running the government. He's remained more or less in the same place since, though did get a haircut when barbershops were allowed to reopen in Ottawa in mid-June.

The US approach

Trump, meanwhile, has adopted a different approach. Buoyed by an intensive testing regimen that White House aides say protects him from contacting the virus, Trump has traveled around the country on both official and political travel, including to states where case counts are surging.

While some of his events are designed to assess the country's response to the virus -- including tours of mask factories and medical distribution centers -- other trips stretch the definition of ""essential,"" including campaign rallies and fundraising jaunts

Trump has similarly ignored government guidance on avoiding large crowds, convening a major audience (though still smaller than he was expecting) at a rally in Tulsa and at July 4 celebrations at Mount Rushmore and on the White House South Lawn. At none of those events were many attendees wearing masks, and Trump's refusal to wear a mask in public is, by now, a defining feature of his coronavirus response. Trudeau has been pictured wearing a mask several times.

Months into the outbreak, the two men confront very different national health situations. Cases are spiking in the United States, a phenomenon Trump has blamed on more widespread testing. In Canada, daily case numbers have steadily fallen and are now close to levels seen in March.

Canada had 399 new cases on Monday, according to its Public Health Agency. The United States had just over 47,000.

On Wednesday, Trump plans to host Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador without Trudeau, including for talks in the Oval Office, a ceremony marking the new trade deal and an evening dinner at the White House that will include representatives of the business community.

Lopez Obrador said before departing Mexico that he had tested negative for coronavirus. Like the President of Poland, who was Trump's first foreign visitor amid the coronavirus pandemic, the Mexican delegation is expected to be tested before arriving at the White House.

The trip to Washington marks Lopez Obrador's first since taking office in 2018. Instead of using the presidential aircraft, he flew commercially with a layover, sitting in an economy class exit row with his advisers, a mask over his face for the duration of the trip.

Trump once sought to establish close ties with a number of younger, male world leaders who he believed he could influence, including Trudeau and French President Emmanuel Macron. Shunning protocol, Trump went as far as to give both men his personal cell phone number. Several administration officials said that Trudeau was known to take advantage of the direct line to the American president, and regularly called his cell phone, particularly during contentious negotiations over the new trade deal.

However, Trump is vastly unpopular among Canadians and Trudeau gradually realized that close ties to this American president may be a liability, not an asset, these people said, and he has increasingly opted to distance himself from Trump.

In December, a video emerged from a private gathering at the NATO summit which appeared to show Trudeau and Macron making fun of Trump

In his book, Trump's former national security adviser John Bolton writes that Trump doesn't particularly like Trudeau (or, for that matter, Macron).

""He tolerated them, mockingly crossing swords with them in meetings, kidding on the straight,"" Bolton writes. ""I assume they understood what he was doing, and they responded in kind, playing along because it suited their larger interests not to be in a permanent tiff with the US President.""",Trudeau led his country out of a pandemic while Trump's lack of leadership leaves the US in deep crisis,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/08/politics/trump-justin-trudeau-coronavirus-north-american-trade-agreement/index.html,2020-07-08
Eliza Mackintosh,"(CNN) Misha was living in a hotel in a leafy suburb of Ireland's capital city under the country's controversial asylum seeker accommodation system when a letter arrived.

She had been waiting months for a decision to be made on her asylum status. But the letter wasn't about that.

Misha, and dozens of other asylum seekers at the Dublin hotel were notified that they would be moved to a rural town over 200 miles away, on the west coast of Ireland, due to concerns over Covid-19 spreading through the accommodation, which was also shared by paying guests. She had less than 24 hours to pack her things.

When she was transferred to the Skellig Star accommodation center in Cahersiveen, County Kerry, on March 18, she was hopeful it would be safe. But, after arriving and being told to bunk with another asylum seeker she didn't know, she began to fear the worst.

""I was scared for my life,"" said Misha, who asked that her real name not be used for fear it might impact her asylum claim.

About 100 people in total were transferred from a handful of centers, including from one Dublin hotel where a guest from Italy had reportedly contracted the virus.

Just days after they arrived, one of the residents started showing symptoms, according to three people CNN talked to. Then the rumors started.

""I was scared for my life."" Misha

The Cahersiveen community had been given just as little time to prepare; locals found out only a few days before that the Skellig Star — rebuilt in 2006 on the promise of drawing tourists with a swimming pool and other leisure facilities — was being converted into accommodation for asylum seekers.

Despite their lack of consultation and concerns over losing business from the only major hotel in town, people in Cahersiveen welcomed the group, bringing them clothes and toys. But when news began swirling that asylum seekers were getting sick, and still shopping in the local stores, people in the small town began to panic.

""Rural Ireland would love to have these people living in the community ... they'd be more than welcome,"" said Jack Fitzpatrick, chairman of the Cahersiveen Community and Business Alliance. ""But, this is not the way to do it, to plunk 100 people into a very congested hotel in the midst of a pandemic.""

The outbreak, which swiftly spread through the hotel, infecting 25 people at its peak, was declared over on May 20 by Ireland's Health Service Executive (HSE), but local residents and asylum seekers are continuing to push for the center to be shut down, joining together as a united front in a series of demonstrations.

Asylum seekers at the Skellig Star hold a banner protesting the handling of the Covid-19 outbreak on May 7.

Under a system known as Direct Provision, overseen by Ireland's Department of Justice and Equality and operated by private businesses on lucrative contracts , asylum seekers are housed in emergency accommodation while they wait to find out if they will be granted refugee status and permission to stay in the country.

Calls for reform of the system, introduced initially as an emergency measure by the state in 1999 after a sudden increase in asylum applications, have coincided with sweeping, global protests for racial justice following the killing of George Floyd in the US.

Asylum seekers — many of whom are from African countries — have condemned Direct Provision for ""institutionalized racism"" on the part of the government, arguing that no one else in the country is treated in the same way as they are.

While their appeal is being assessed, they're provided with free accommodation, food and utilities, and have access to healthcare and education, but they have almost no autonomy and cannot choose where they live. And they are unable to apply for a work permit until at least eight months into their application process — expected to survive on a weekly allowance of €38.80 ($43) instead.

Commenting on the comparison between Direct Provision and the murder of George Floyd earlier this month, Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar conceded that while some Direct Provision accommodation was substandard and needed to change, it ""ultimately is a service offered by the state ... involves people being provided with free accommodation, food, heat, lighting, health care, education, and also some spending money.""

""It's not the same thing as a man being killed by the police.""

Decisions on asylum cases in Ireland can take years, a fact that has been criticized by the United Nations Refugee Agency , which recently called for the process to be sped up. And rejection rates are high — around 70%, according to recent figures . Dozens of people have died waiting, according to a Freedom of Information request from The Irish Catholic

Not fit for purpose

Ireland's Fianna Fail , Fine Gael and Green Party struck a draft deal to form a new coalition government on Monday, which, if ratified by the members of the three parties, will end months of political stalemate since the country's election in February. It will also inject urgency into reforming the Irish asylum system. One of the key commitments outlined in the agreement is a pledge to end Direct Provision and replace it with an accommodation policy centered on a not-for-profit approach.

Liam Thornton, a law lecturer and Direct Provision expert, greeted the decision with cautious optimism. ""After 20-plus years of government denial that anything much was wrong, it's interesting to see,"" he told CNN. ""While we haven't been here before, it is implementation that will be key.""

Thornton tweeted : ""Direct Provision is one of the darkest chapters in the Dept of Justice history. But it takes people to design, administer, implement such awfulness. New mindsets needed ASAP.""

Asylum seekers, human rights campaigners and legal experts such as Thornton say the pandemic has shone a spotlight on structural problems that have long existed in Ireland's asylum system. Against the backdrop of Covid-19, the often crowded, poor conditions have become that much more apparent.

""HSE has been advising us, and everybody, on social distancing, but you cannot social distance where there is no space,"" Misha said.

""We were sharing bedrooms with strangers. We were sharing the dining room. We were sharing the salt shakers. We were sharing the lobby. We were sharing everything. And if you looked at the whole situation, you cannot really say that it was fit for purpose.""

Skellig Star residents, locked inside the center during quarantine, chant ""move us out"" on April 29.

Misha says she watched in horror as people started falling sick around her, before being pulled into makeshift isolation rooms. The first suspected case of Covid-19 in the center was reported as early as March 24, the Justice Department has conceded, adding that the person did not test positive. They did not say when the test was conducted.

According to asylum seekers and a previous manager, testing of asylum seekers didn't start until weeks later in mid-April. After positive cases were confirmed, all residents at the Skellig Star were ordered to stay inside and quarantine.

""I have verifiable evidence of a written communication from the Skellig Star to the Department of Justice and Equality on 24 March confirming a suspected case of Covid-19. The resident concerned was placed in isolation on 20 March, one day after arrival in Cahersiveen,"" Member of Parliament for Kerry, Norma Foley, said in a special parliamentary committee hearing on the government's Covid-19 response.

""The timeline might not be of importance to either the HSE or the Department of Justice and Equality but it is very important to the residents of the Skellig Star and the community of Cahersiveen. This timeline confirms unequivocally that Covid-19 was transported by bus on 18 March and 19 March to the Skellig Star and the community of Cahersiveen.""

In a statement to CNN regarding the timeline, the Department said it had made an ""honest mistake"" in failing to receive the March 24 communication and that ""there was no attempt by the Department ... to intentionally mislead or conceal the facts"" related to the outbreak.

""Our biggest fear is a second wave ... We're afraid it will spread like wildfire in the hotel again, but next time it may also go through the community."" Jack Fitzpatrick

After her roommate tested positive and was taken away to self-isolate at another center, Misha thought that someone would move her, so that the room could be disinfected. When no one came, she said she raised her concerns with an HSE worker on site, who told her there was no reason to worry.

""It was an embarrassment to my intelligence,"" Misha said. She tested positive 10 days later.

Ireland's Justice Department told CNN that an HSE Development Worker was at the hotel to monitor the health of residents and staff throughout the outbreak, and is now providing more general support, including accessing mainstream health services and integrating in the local community.

The Department said it was continuing to work closely with the HSE and Cahersiveen center managers to ensure the wellbeing of all residents and staff, including offering all single residents their own bedrooms and providing enhanced cleaning services. The center also intends to provide self-catering facilities so that residents can cook in their rooms, instead of eating together in a communal dining room.

Townbe, the company that operates Skellig and three other Direct Provision centers, did not respond to CNN's request for comment. The Justice Department said it was unable to comment on the value of the contract with Townbe until after two years, because of commercial sensitivity.

But the conditions detailed by the Justice Department differ dramatically with what was described to CNN by two asylum seekers and one previous manager at the center.

Fears of second outbreak

When Misha and the other asylum seekers arrived at the Skellig Star in mid-March, they said they found a holiday hotel that was not ready for guests, or prepared to cope with the coronavirus. The central heating was broken, the bedrooms — which were smaller than standard size — were not deep cleaned, isolation rooms had not been established, personal protective equipment was not made available and staff had not been vetted by An Garda Síochána, Ireland's national police service.

Bulelani Mfaco, an activist who has been living in Direct Provision since 2017, detailed some of these conditions in a report for the Movement of Asylum Seekers in Ireland (MASI) , laying out recommendations for wide-ranging reforms of the system. Top of his list: Guaranteeing a suitable standard of living that protects the physical and mental health.

Skellig Star residents in quarantine wave to locals protesting outside on May 7.

""Cahersiveen demonstrates to us that the model doesn't work,"" Mfaco said. ""Giving vulnerable people to hoteliers, who have no training. No thought was given to the risk of gathering all these people, cramming them into a bus and bringing them to a remote village far from any healthcare services.""

Jack Fitzpatrick and other locals are fearful that those healthcare services will be overstretched if another outbreak hits.

The closest major hospital to Cahersiveen, which has a population of around 1,000, is 40 miles away. There are only two doctors in Cahersiveen, and one ambulance serves the entire remote Iveragh Peninsula, where the town is situated.

""We were very lucky that nobody died in the hotel, and that we managed to stop the virus going widespread in the community,"" said Fitzpatrick.

""Our biggest fear is a second wave ... We're afraid it will spread like wildfire in the hotel again, but next time it may also go through the community. So we are basically doing our best to try to get them to close it down and move the people to sort accommodation.""

People in the town are demanding the resignation of Justice Minister Charlie Flanagan, who they say misled the public over the Covid-19 outbreak at the Skellig Star.

""We should be given, at least, the status of permission to remain so we can have our own-door accommodation, cook our own meals and keep ourselves and our families safe from the virus."" Azwar Fuard

Flanagan has apologized to the people of Cahersiveen , but said his department had no knowledge of the infection in the Dublin hotel before transferring asylum seekers from it.

In the wake of the outbreak, Flanagan has asked the former Secretary General to undertake a review of the Department's response to Covid-19 in direct provision centers like Cahersiveen.

Ciaran Quinlan, of Cahersiveen, told CNN he is seeking an injunction to close the center. He says he wants ""to help these people to get their own front-door accommodation, and to move them out of the unsuitable accommodation that they're in.""

Azwar Fuard, an asylum seeker who has been acting as a spokesman for the 70 residents remaining at the center, is calling on Flanagan to grant the Skellig Star residents amnesty to remain in Ireland.

Fuard, originally from Sri Lanka, was moved from the same hotel as Misha in Dublin with his young family just as they were starting to feel settled. Both Fuard and his wife had found work in the capital, made friends, and their three-year-old daughter had started going to pre-school. To be ripped away from yet another life, he said, was like a double trauma.

Now he says the family of three is largely confined to a 12ft x 13ft room, with an ensuite bathroom and no cooking or washing facilities.

""We should be given, at least, the status of permission to remain so we can have our own-door accommodation, cook our own meals and keep ourselves and our families safe from the virus,"" Fuard said.","Amid the pandemic, a group of asylum seekers was moved to a small, rural Irish town.

London (CNN Business) Companies often talk about the benefits of scale. And during a pandemic, it appears bigger can be better.

What's happening: A new analysis by Bank of America found that spending at big restaurant chains has ""largely recovered,"" while small chains and independent eateries remain under pressure. It pointed toas one player with a big presence whose shares could rise over the longer term.

""Larger chains [are] flexing [the] benefits of size,"" analysts Gregory Francfort and JonMichael Shekian told clients.

Chipotle's stock is up 33% this year. The company's investments in technology — one of such advantages — have helped it pivot to delivery and takeout, with digital sales shooting up 81% in the first quarter. Meanwhile, its commitment to food safety protocols following past scandals allowed it to quickly implement safeguards specific to the coronavirus.

Why it matters: Scale allows companies to paper over issues at struggling locations and spread out costs associated with new safety measures. That flexibility could be crucial as Covid-19 cases rise across parts of the United States, forcing at least two dozen states to pause or roll back reopening plans.

Still, size isn't a panacea. Walgreens said Thursday that it's cutting 4,000 jobs at its UK pharmacy chain Boots, which kept most of its stores open through lockdown. The company cited a ""dramatic decline"" in footfall.

UK shoppers are making a tentative return to shops as lockdown restrictions ease, according to a report Friday from the British Retail Consortium and ShopperTrak, a research firm.

But the country's High Streets, which host the top chains, remain under strain. Footfall declined by nearly 65% year-on-year in June. As non-essential stores began to reopen in second part of the month, traffic improved — but was still down 58% compared to 2019.

Governments are frantically trying to get people to feel comfortable shopping and dining out again. Earlier this week, UK finance minister Rishi Sunak announced that meals at participating restaurants, cafes and pubs will be discounted by up to £10 ($12.61) per head from Monday to Wednesday for the month of August.

The path the virus takes could dictate the success of these efforts, however. In the United States, high-frequency data indicates that the number of seated diners at restaurants has been sliding since the July 4 holiday weekend as cases shoot up in some states.

There are signs of a pullback in activity even in states that have not reimposed restrictions, Andrew Hunter of Capital Economics told clients this week. That indicates that fears about the virus could outweigh messaging from the government — which would hit chains and independent stores alike.

Demand for oil could be hit by a rise in new infections

Oil supply hit a nine-year low in June as OPEC, its allies and producers in the United States pulled back to meet diminished demand for energy, the International Energy Agency said in a report released Friday.

That's helped push Brent crude futures, the global benchmark for oil prices, back above $40 per barrel. But the agency warned that the recent rise in coronavirus cases and the return of partial lockdowns ""introduces more uncertainty into the forecast.""

""While the oil market has undoubtedly made progress since 'Black April,' the large, and in some countries, accelerating number of Covid-19 cases is a disturbing reminder that the pandemic is not under control and the risk to our market outlook is almost certainly to the downside,"" the IEA said.

The agency now expects demand to plunge by 7.9 million barrels per day this year, a slightly smaller decline than forecast in its previous report.

The April to June period wasn't quite as bad as expected, it said, with demand rebounding ""strongly"" in China and India this spring. In China, transport fuel deliveries actually surpassed 2019 levels in April and May.

That said: Globally, demand for transport fuel is still ""much lower"" than it was one year ago, per the IEA.

And it's difficult to predict the effect of a virus resurgence in some regions. One one hand, a spike in cases could push more people to use cars, which would prop up fuel demand. But it could also just serve to reduce the amount of people moving around, limiting demand for energy.

Watch this space: Demand could also take a hit if governments enact large-scale clean energy programs as part of their economic recovery plans. The International Energy Agency hosted a summit Thursday with 40 government ministers to discuss how to reduce global emissions while boosting the economy.

A 'dangerous new normal' for the US job market

Week after week, the number of initial unemployment claims filed by Americans has declined. But the overall scale of applications for jobless benefits has remained stubbornly high, feeding fears among economists that the recovery is running into trouble.

The latest: Initial claims for the week ending July 4 came in at 1.3 million , down slightly from 1.4 million the previous week. That's well below the apex of nearly 6.9 claims reached in late March.

But Daniel Zhao, senior economist at Glassdoor, expressed concern about a ""dangerous new normal.""

""The decline in initial claims appears to be stalling out, with well over a million initial [unemployment insurance] claims being filed every week,"" he said in a blog post Thursday. ""This level of [unemployment insurance] claims, almost double the pre-crisis record, was unthinkable just a few months ago.""

James Knightley, chief international economist at ING, told clients that jobless claims have proved ""far stickier than most analysts thought likely as the reopening got underway.""

""Unfortunately we don't expect to see meaningful declines from these huge numbers anytime soon,"" Knightley said.

The numbers should bolster Congress' resolve to pass additional stimulus measures, which are currently locked in partisan negotiations, said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM. But he warned that ""fiscal fatigue"" appears to be taking hold.

Analysis Luke Mcgee,"London (CNN) For more than 70 years, the transatlantic alliance has served as the unshakable foundation of European stability and underpinned the values of the US-led Western order. In 2020, it appears that relationship is being rethought on both sides of the Atlantic.

Earlier this week, the European Union declined to include US in its list of "" safe countries ,"" meaning that American travelers will be unwelcome inside the bloc for the foreseeable future, due to the eyewatering US coronavirus infection numbers. Controversially, the list includes China -- the country where the virus originated -- on the condition of reciprocal arrangements.

EU officials insist that the decision was not political and based entirely on epidemiological evidence, in the hope this would pacify US President Donald Trump, a man who has attacked the bloc on several occasions.

However, others privately concede that had Brussels wanted to make the pill more palatable for an American audience, they could have added a sugar coating. ""In the past, I can see that we might have not included China in order to keep the US happy,"" says an EU diplomat not authorized to speak on record about how the decision was made.

It might seem a stretch to take this incident as evidence of a rupture in transatlantic relations, until you place it in the current geopolitical context. It's no secret that Washington takes less of an interest in European affairs these days. And it's well known that European nations actively seek greater diplomatic autonomy from America. This is especially true for the 27 member states of the European Union.

One of the ways Brussels thinks it can distance itself from DC is by engaging with China as a strategic and economic partner, decreasing its reliance on one of the world's superpowers by balancing its relationship with the other.

In the past few years, Brussels has stuck to its guns on big, international matters as Trump tore everything up. Think of the Paris Climate Accord, the Iran Nuclear deal, 5G , and you start to see a pattern of behavior in which the EU could be perceived to have sided with China over its oldest ally. Sure, it might be a ungenerous read of the situation, given the deep, established bond between Europe and the US, but in this context, any perceived friendliness to Beijing punches a very real bruise.

""Knowing what we know about China's data, how it has behaved during the pandemic and the White House's stance, I think in another world we would have kept them off,"" says the diplomat. That other world he refers to isn't simply the world before Trump took office.

Controversially, the EU has included China -- the country where the novel coronavirus originated -- on its list of ""safe countries"" on condition of reciprocal agreements.

One Brussels official who works on EU foreign policy but is not authorized to speak on the record said the shift away from Europe as a geopolitical priority began under former US president Barack Obama.

""Obama didn't have as close an interest in the Middle East as previous presidents, which is geographically more of a European problem. And he was shifting his priorities from Europe to China and Asia,"" the official said.

However, longstanding observers of the alliance accept it has been strained over the past four years -- and will worsen still if Donald Trump beats former vice president Joe Biden in this year's US election. ""Trump considers the EU, especially Germany, an economic and trade rival, which means tensions can be expected in the case he gets a second term,"" says Velina Tchakarova, from the Austrian Institute for European and Security Policy.

She says that as the EU is taking steps toward ""building stronger autonomy in the field of security and defence,"" Trump tries to ""undermine such efforts through his attacks on the European NATO members as well as through economic and trade measures.""

The Brussels official explains that Trump's ""break from multilateralism"" on big international matters like Iran, coupled with the US taking ""less responsibility in European security"" has accelerated European thinking to take a step away from America and ""do our own thing on the world stage.""

This characterization of a hostile US administration that goes out of its way to avoid working with Europeans is one that the EU diplomat recognizes. ""The problem is, officials in DC who want to work with Europe, while in contact, don't have the mandate from the government to engage in any serious way. They have hung on as long as they can but if we get a second Trump term, then we are in real trouble.""

President Trump has criticized the bloc on several occasions.

This, according to Tchakarova, is why ""EU institutions and leaders of the member states hope that Joe Biden will be elected in November ... he is in favor of multilateralism and the expectation is that he will strengthen the ties between the USA and Europe.""

CNN approached numerous officials from the EU institutions and diplomats on both sides of the Atlantic for comment. Most declined to comment; several conceded that they believed this to be the case. One European diplomat said: ""We'll dance with whoever is on the dance floor, but it doesn't take a genius to see that the EU-US cooperation is currently underperforming.""

Asked to comment on a potential pivot by the EU away from its historical ties with the US, a State Department spokesperson said: ""The United States and the EU share a strong, enduring partnership based on common democratic values and governance, respect for human rights and the rule of law, deep economic ties, and a commitment to Transatlantic prosperity and security. This longstanding partnership is vital as we coordinate on a host of international efforts.""

However, a potential Biden victory would provide no quick fix for the transatlantic partnership. ""The question is not really if you can get the relationship back to where it was, but if we can persuade the US to re-join the Western order,"" says the EU diplomat.

""The US and EU geopolitical pivots on Asia, the Middle East and trade have respectively already begun. The difference at the moment is we think the West should be pivoting as one.""

And even if Biden did go back to Obama-era policy on Europe, there is no guarantee that in four years' time he wouldn't be replaced by someone even more radical than Trump. ""The fundamental shifts going on in the US will probably remain and we have to adjust, making the best of the relationship we can. These shifts, they are structural and they are not just based on one person,"" says the Brussels official.

Of course, none of this means that the transatlantic alliance will stop being important. It will remain central to what the West represents, and the US will always be a more important ally to Europe than China ever could be. Besides, the EU's big plans to engage more with China were dealt a major blow by the Covid-19 outbreak.

However, that fading veneer of warmth -- with Europe seeking a new place on the world stage as the US's global role becomes inherently more unpredictable -- can only be seen as good news for those that these historic Western powers were united against not so long ago.",Cracks in the Trump-Europe relationship are turning into a chasm,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/04/europe/trump-europe-relationship-intl/index.html,2020-07-04
Analysis Julia Horowitz,"London (CNN Business) Brexit and the coronavirus pandemic are reshaping the UK economy . Could it end up looking more like Turkey, Mexico and Argentina than France, Germany and the United States ?

Some analysts on Wall Street are beginning to wonder whether a volatile currency, declining global clout and a reliance on foreign investors could relegate the United Kingdom to ""emerging market"" status.

Bank of America suggested in a recent note to clients that it may be time to treat the British pound as an emerging market currency, citing Brexit and worsening debt dynamics as a result of Covid-19.

""We believe [the pound] is in the process of evolving into a currency that resembles the underlying reality of the British economy: small and shrinking,"" wrote BofA strategists Kamal Sharma and Myria Kyriacou.

There are reasons the demotion to emerging market status seems like a stretch. The pound is heavily traded, investors have maintained their faith in British institutions and there's high demand for debt issued by the country's government.

But what the comparisons make clear is that investors are bracing for a world in which the United Kingdom's standing is diminished.

""We don't think there's any risk that the UK is suddenly going to be viewed as an emerging market,"" said Thomas Pugh, UK economist at the research firm Capital Economics. But Brexit and the country's response to the pandemic, he said, ""will weigh on confidence.""

A sagging United Kingdom

The United Kingdom, which has one of the highest per capita Covid-19 death rates in the world, is battling a deep recession as a result of lockdowns aimed at containing the virus.

The Bank of England estimates the UK economy could shrink by 14% this year, its worst downturn in more than 300 years . The country also has fewer than six months to hammer out a new trade deal with the European Union, its biggest export market.

The pound has become extremely volatile amid uncertainty about the United Kingdom's path forward. It's now trading at $1.26, down more than 15% since the 2016 Brexit referendum.

Bank of America's Sharma and Kyriacou described its fluctuations as ""neurotic at best, unfathomable at worst."" The only currency that investors see as more unstable is the Brazilian real, they noted.

Brexit, they added, isn't helping. The country's departure from the European Union ""is likely to permanently alter the way in which investors view the pound,"" Sharma and Kyriacou said.

Investors also have to stomach concerns about Britain living beyond its means.

For years, Britain has carried a sizable current account deficit, which means it spends more on goods, services and investments abroad than it brings in at home. That's now coupled with a worsening fiscal deficit as the country borrows huge amounts to finance its pandemic recovery plans. As of May, Britain's debt was bigger than the size of the entire economy for the first time since 1963

A pedestrian walks a dog along a street in Manchester on July 7.

This week, finance minister Rishi Sunak unveiled another £30 billion ($37.8 billion) coronavirus stimulus package aimed at stemming a growing jobs crisis. The Institute for Fiscal Studies, an economic think tank, predicted that the latest measures would likely push this year's deficit further north of £300 billion ($378 billion), which it said would be ""easily"" the highest as a share of national income since World War II.

These dynamics make Britain vulnerable to a rise in interest rates. Rates are extremely low right now and expected to stay that way for a long time. But a spike in inflation could change that calculus.

Per Sharma and Kyriacou, Britain's so-called ""dual deficit"" — its current account deficit and its fiscal deficit taken together — will be wider next year than that of Mexico and Turkey, as well as the G20 average.

Emerging market Britain?

The United Kingdom is still the sixth largest economy in the world. On most counts, it falls squarely into the ""developed market"" camp.

The British pound makes up 4.4% of the world's currency reserves, according to data from the International Monetary Fund, suggesting that foreign central banks consider it a safe bet.

Investors also place a lot of trust in the country's institutions, including the Bank of England, which was founded more than 325 years ago. The central bank has moved swiftly during the current crisis, dropping interest rates and ramping up its bond-buying program

Those bond purchases are allowing the UK government to finance its recovery efforts as it borrows record amounts, while supporting demand for UK government bonds, known as gilts.

The yield on the benchmark 10-year bond is 0.14%, reflecting its status as a safe haven. The yield on Mexico's 10-year bond, for comparison, is 5.76%, while Turkey's is 12.43%, indicating a much higher risk premium.

""There doesn't seem to be any ... unwillingness to buy and hold UK debt,"" UBS economist Dean Turner said. Should demand falter, there's an expectation that the Bank of England would quickly step in.

Still, there is a growing view that the country's stature in global markets could be under threat over the longer term.

Britain's budget watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, said in March — before the country entered lockdown — that it expected economic output to be about 4% lower over the next 15 years than it would have been without Brexit, even if the United Kingdom and the European Union reach a ""typical"" free trade agreement.

And Britain is not impervious to an emerging market-style currency crisis, if history is any guide.

In 1976, the country — battling a run on the pound triggered by recession and concern about high levels of public spending — was forced to appeal for a nearly $4 billion IMF loan.

""You only have to go [back] to the '70s when there was last real currency crisis,"" Pugh said. ""It's certainly not unheard of.""",Could the United Kingdom become an emerging market?,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/10/business/uk-emerging-market/index.html,2020-07-10
Hanna Ziady,"London has seen more than its share of crises. The 2000-year old metropolis has endured an influenza pandemic, the Blitz and several financial meltdowns over just the past century.

Time and again, London has come roaring back, relying on a spirit of resilience and reinvention that is being summoned once more as the British capital seeks to recover from what may be this century's greatest upheaval: the coronavirus pandemic.

The spread of the virus and efforts to contain it turned one of the world's liveliest urban meccas into a virtual ghost town, driving millions of people out of the city's center and its financial district, and bringing commerce to a sudden halt.

Spectators at the New Year's Day Parade. Over 10,000 performers paraded from Piccadilly Circus to Parliament Square.

The scale of the shutdown would have been unimaginable just six months ago, when around 500,000 people poured into the area around Piccadilly Circus for the annual New Year's Day Parade and it was common to wait 90 minutes for a table at the busiest restaurants.

Then the pandemic hit. Virtually overnight, shops closed, tourists fled, offices and streets emptied out and the city's 9 million residents holed up at home. Nowhere was the standstill captured more acutely than in the mainstay of London city life: the Tube.

Underground journeys for the month of March tumbled 43% from the 106 million recorded in February, and plunged even further in April, during the height of lockdown, to just 5.7 million. Social distancing rules mean the Tube can only handle up to 15% of its normal traffic, according to London's mayor, Sadiq Khan.

The fallout from lockdown has been severe. London's economy is expected to contract nearly 17% this year, according to figures from the city government, a sharper drop than the 14% decline the Bank of England expects for the United Kingdom as a whole.

Companies in London are expected to shed some 460,000 jobs, or about 7% of the workforce, with manufacturing, construction, retail, and accommodation and food services the hardest hit. Employment is not expected to fully recover until 2022.

With transportation severely constrained, and a potential coronavirus vaccine still many months away, the people and companies that have made London into a hub for real estate, finance, the arts, hospitality and technology are desperately trying to reinvent themselves in hopes of surviving the pandemic.

One sign of progress: pubs, restaurants and hair salons can reopen on Saturday, provided they follow social distancing guidelines.

The physical city

What the pandemic means for London's sprawling collection of corporate headquarters is still unclear. Paul Cheshire, professor of economic geography at the London School of Economics, is quick to dismiss the suggestion that the office is dead as ""nonsense,"" arguing that what happens in the long term will be less dramatic.

More people will spend more time working from home, or in decentralized office spaces, but this won't abolish companies' demand for locations in the city center, which have been shown to increase productivity and facilitate idea sharing, he said.

Commuters walk across London Bridge on February 3, 2020. The city went into lockdown on March 24.

What happens to real estate, which accounts for 15% of London's economy, matters a great deal to the city.

The government has protected commercial tenants from eviction through August, but those measures will at some point expire. According to property management platform, Re-Leased, just 45% of commercial rents for the third quarter had been paid by early July. But that was an improvement on the previous three months and ""a sign of the capital's resilience,"" said Re-Leased CEO, Tom Wallace.

The pandemic has accelerated existing trends around agile working and the desire for more flexible office space, where several different companies share meeting and social areas, as well as facilities such as showers, bike racks and kitchens.

Companies ""want their offices to count,"" said Darren Richards, head of real estate at British Land, a leading UK property company. He predicts that greater numbers of older offices in need of refurbishment will likely be released onto the market in the future, as companies prioritize higher quality spaces.

British Land owns 22.8 million square feet of commercial real estate, including 7.1 million square feet of offices in areas like Broadgate, Paddington, Mayfair and Regent's Place. It said that its tenants are currently not seeking to get rid of office space. Businesses still ""want space fundamentally,"" though they are contemplating how much and for what purpose, Richards said.

Still, the penetration of online shopping during the coronavirus will mean a reduction in brick-and-mortar outlets, which could radically alter the landscape of London's vast retail space and create yet more uncertainty for the city's real estate market. ""What would have happened over five years is happening over months,"" said Richards.

The City, reinvented

London's financial heart, referred to as the City of London, has a proven track record of reinvention.

Storied institutions like Lloyd's of London, the Bank of England and the London Stock Exchange have been around for centuries, withstanding radical social, political and economic turmoil

Today, the City is home to well over 250 international banks and handles 43% of global foreign exchange trading, according to the Bank for International Settlements. Financial services contributed £65 billion ($81 billion) to the London economy in 2018, or about 15%, figures from City Hall show.

And despite four years of uncertainty over Brexit, the United Kingdom has been Europe's top location for international financial services investment over the past two decades, with London claiming the bulk of those flows.

People observe social distancing as they look out at the skyline of London's financial district on June 9.

""London's dominance as the preeminent European financial center remains unrivaled,"" said Omar Ali, EY's UK financial services managing partner.

UK financial services will continue to be a leading recipient of overseas investment even after the pandemic, according to an EY survey conducted in April.

Investors ranked the availability of capital as the most important consideration influencing their future location choices, followed by safety and security measures introduced to prevent a future major crisis, whether that relates to health, the environment or cyber security.

London's dominance as the preeminent European financial center remains unrivaled."" Omar Ali, EY

There are factors working against the City, however. The UK government's handling of the coronavirus crisis has been widely criticized, and business and consumer confidence remains depressed.

""We failed to take advantage of the fact that we're an island and didn't move fast enough. There was a lot of complacency and hubris,"" said Richard Burge, the CEO of the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

The government's approach to negotiating its post-Brexit trading relationship with the European Union has also drawn reproach. A group of business leaders warned this week that Britain's decision not to extend the current transition period beyond the end of the year is a "" huge gamble .""

The City of London may yet be tested. Crucially, there is currently no guarantee that UK financial firms will retain access to the European Union after this year — an export market worth £26 billion ($32.4 billion) in 2018, according to the Office for National Statistics, or 40% of the sector's total value.

Still good for startups

As London seeks to retain its status as a leading global business center, the city's technology sector, which boomed following the global financial crisis, could help.

Google, GOOGL Facebook FB Amazon AMZN andhave big offices in London, and startup investment has continued during the pandemic, suggesting that losses in real estate and financial services could be made up in the tech sector. Startups based in London have raised $4 billion in venture capital since the start of the year, more than Paris, Stockholm, Berlin and Tel Aviv combined, according to figures compiled in June by Tech Nation and Dealroom.

""It's a global arms race but London is still ahead,"" said Brent Hoberman, the co-founder of Founders Factory, an accelerator. ""I think London absolutely remains as the global magnet for tech talent,"" he added, attributing its attractiveness to world class educational institutions, diverse culture and early entrepreneur success stories.

Lockdowns have only accelerated the adoption of digital technologies in everyday life, and boosted information and health technology companies, playing to London's strengths, said Suranga Chandratillake, a partner at Balderton Capital, one of Europe's leading early stage venture capital investors with stakes in companies such as Citymapper, Vivino, Lyst and Revolut.

The city is home to a large share of digital consumer businesses, Chandratillake said, including online grocer Ocado, digital banks such as Revolut and Monzo, and food delivery companies such as Deliveroo and Gousto.

London also boasts an outsized share of technology companies in areas such as cyber security and workforce management, now servicing armies of home workers. And the coronavirus has boosted investment into health technology, benefiting London and the United Kingdom more broadly.

""The city is the most genetically diverse in the world, almost all citizens use the same health system and there are a variety of tech projects, both government-funded within the NHS [National Health Service] and privately-funded startups, that have grown rapidly against this backdrop and stand in a very strong position,"" Chandratillake told CNN Business.

Zoom ZM The pandemic could even help to catalyze new ways of doing business. London & Partners, the trade and investment body for London, said it recently organized a trade mission via, where a group of human resources tech entrepreneurs pitched their businesses to potential investors and customers in New York.

""If we assume a reduction in travel, it points towards naturally digital sectors in which London has existing strengths,"" said managing director of strategy and corporate affairs, Allen Simpson.

Saving London's culture

While London's tech and finance sectors look set to weather the current crisis, social distancing and a reduction in travel spells disaster for its once booming arts and culture scene, which helps attract tourists, ambitious young professionals and investment. For theaters, museums, restaurants and bars, it's an existential threat.

Leisure and hospitality ""really strategically matter,"" said Simpson. ""People come from all over the world partly because London is a cool place to live.""

Nearly 40% of Londoners are born outside the United Kingdom, making London one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the world. It is home to 1 million EU nationals and was the world's third most visited city in 2018, narrowly behind Paris and Bangkok, according to Mastercard.

Last year, London boasted 21.7 million overseas visitors who spent £15.7 billion ($19.6 billion) on the local economy and supported 250,000 jobs, according to the Office for National Statistics.

""That revenue keeps certain things alive in London,"" said UK Tourism Alliance director Kurt Janson. ""The West End theaters couldn't survive if not for overseas visitors.""

In an open letter to the government signed by UK Theatre and nearly 100 actors, writers and directors, the Society of London Theatre worried that ""British theatre is on the brink of ruin.""

""Theatres do not have the money to operate viably with physical distancing,"" they said. The industry has called for an emergency relief fund, ongoing wage support and more help for freelancers and self-employed artists.

Museums, galleries and London's iconic tourist attractions are also at risk. Several have not yet announced plans to reopen, despite being allowed to do so on Saturday. In a joint statement issued late last month, directors of museums such as the Tate, British Museum and National Gallery said it was a question of ""how and when we can open our doors again in a financially sustainable manner, for the long term.""

The National Gallery has said it will reopen on July 8, while the Tate Britain and Tate Modern will reopen on July 27 and the Tower of London on July 10.

On Sunday, the government announced a £1.57 billion ($1.96 billion) rescue package, mostly in the form of grants, to ""provide a lifeline"" to the arts and culture sector. Details of how the bailout will be distributed still need to be ironed out, but it was welcomed by industry leaders. ""This is a vital next step on the road to recovery for the industry and will help to support and sustain the UK's vibrant arts ecology through this crisis,"" Alex Beard, CEO of the Royal Opera House, said in a statement.

London's pubs and restaurants face an even greater threat from social distancing.

Already, Michelin-starred Texture and the upmarket Indian Accent, a Mayfair outpost of the Delhi original, have permanently closed. They are unlikely to be the only casualties.

Murat Kilic, the owner of Amber, in the hip East Aldgate neighborhood, told CNN Business that he is not confident about reopening. Amber is opening its doors on Saturday for the first time in nearly four months, but at less than half its previous capacity.

Kilic worries that when government support is wound down in October, he could risk eviction unless his landlord agrees to temporarily reduce monthly rent payments.

For Joseph Ryan, business looks set to boom over the July 4 weekend at his two pubs in London. Howl at the Moon and The White Hart have far more bookings than usual, Ryan said, but he is less optimistic about the longer term outlook.

Indoor capacity has been cut in half, seating is now mandatory, wooden panels have been erected between tables, and staff will be wearing masks and gloves.

""We're confident about this weekend, but thereafter we're not so sure,"" said Ryan. ""The novelty might wear off.""

Whether Londoners are quick to return to bars and eateries remains to be seen. Worryingly, household income and expenditure are set to tumble by 5.5% and 12% respectively this year, and are not expected to reach 2019 levels before at least 2023, according to City Hall.

How quickly a new London emerges depends on the coronavirus: if cases continue to fall and social distancing is eased further, the economic outlook will brighten. A second wave could prompt further lockdowns and all the economic pain that brings.

London will find ""workarounds"" to the immediate challenges posed by the virus, said Burge of the London Chamber, from becoming a city of cyclists and walkers to standing outside bars in the drizzle. ""That's what we do,"" he said. ""London will come through.""

James Griffiths,"Hong Kong (CNN) Driving from their home in New York to Cambridge, Massachusetts, Harrison Li had no idea it would be the last time he saw his father for more than a decade.

It was the summer of 2016, and Li was about to resume his studies at Harvard. After dropping him off, his father returned to Long Island, where he was making final preparations for his own trip to Shanghai.

""We had no inkling anything like this was going to happen,"" the younger Li said.

Kai Li was born in Shanghai, and he was returning to the city for a ceremony to mark the one-year anniversary of his mother's death. However when his plane landed, he was met not by his family, but state security agents -- beginning a years-long ordeal that resulted, in July 2018, in him being sentenced to 10 years in prison for espionage.

The Li family maintains that the charges are trumped up and politically motivated. The case, which was held behind closed doors and has not been widely publicized, revolves around supposed state secrets that Li and his lawyer argue are freely available online, as well as communications with the United States government that are routine for people doing cross-border business.

In a letter to President Donald Trump in January, multiple US lawmakers denounced Li's ""arbitrary detention"" and urged Washington to do more to lobby for his release.

China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not respond to a faxed request for comment from CNN on the case.

Political prosecution

Kai Li appeared to be an American success story. Born in Shanghai in 1962, he emigrated to the US aged 27 to study, and later became an American citizen. A natural entrepreneur, he opened two gas stations on Long Island and also a export business, serving as a wholesale buyer and distributor of solar cells and related technologies for major US aerospace firms. China is among the largest manufacturers of solar equipment in the world.

For his export business, Li regularly traveled to the country to meet with clients, as well as to visit his extended family.

""My father would visit China a couple of times a year, for two or three weeks at a time,"" Harrison Li said. ""He's been doing that for 20-plus years.""

Prior to being detained by state security at the airport in Shanghai, Harrison Li said the family had no idea anything might be amiss. While the motivation behind the case is unclear, Kai Li has since suggested to his son that it could have been prompted by a business rival seeking to get him in trouble with the authorities.

China's justice system is particularly opaque -- especially when it comes to cases regarding state security. No details about Li's case have been published in China, either by the court or state media. Li's eventual trial was held behind closed doors, without US officials present.

For two months, Li was held in residential surveillance at a designated location , an extralegal system a panel of United Nations human rights experts has described as ""tantamount to enforced disappearance,"" which exposes detainees ""to the risk of torture and other inhuman and degrading treatment and other human rights violations.""

During that time, US consular officials alerted Li's family to his situation. According to US lawmakers and Li's family, he was denied access to a lawyer during his initial detention.

Following this, he was moved to another detention center while awaiting charges. There he was held in a small cell, without a bed, forced to sleep on the floor, fed little, and interrogated at all hours, Harrison Li said. Eventually, he was transferred to a regular prison and charged with furnishing Chinese state secrets to the FBI. His family maintains that normal business actions by Li have been ""grossly mischaracterized by Chinese authorities as espionage for political leverage.""

According to the US Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC) , the trial against Li, in July 2018, took place in secret, and was over within an hour. US diplomats were prevented from attending, the CECC and Harrison Li said.

Kai Li was eventually sentenced to 10 years in prison, and moved to Shanghai's Qingpu prison.

Dire conditions

A futuristic-looking complex located in the far west of the city, Qingpu prison is one of the main detention centers for foreigners in China. Its website describes it as ""window to showcase China's rule of law.""

Briton Peter Humphrey, who was held in Qingpu after his 2014 conviction on contested illegal information gathering charges , said that ""from the moon, Qingpu Prison would look like a peaceful walled university campus with dorms, gardens, camphor trees, a soccer pitch and a parade ground.""

""From my level, there were a dozen concrete cell blocks with barred windows, a prison theatre, an office block, a kitchen, a boiler house and a factory,"" Humphrey wrote in 2018 , following his release. ""The perimeter wall bristled with razor wire and was patrolled by armed PAP (people's armed police) guards. It could hold 5,000-6,000 prisoners. It also 'trained' prisoners for redistribution to other prisons.""

The prison made international headlines last year, when a British school girl found a message from inmates written inside a Christmas card

""We are foreign prisoners in Shanghai Qingpu prison China,"" the message read. ""Forced to work against our will. Please help us and notify human rights organization.""

The scandal forced supermarket chain Tesco to drop its Chinese supplier, though authorities in the country denied accusations of forced labor.

Humphrey said he regularly witnessed beatings and prisoners being forced to write confessions or being held in solitary confinement. He said he was denied medical treatment for prostate issues, and worried about his health.

Kai Li's health has also suffered, his son said: ""In his last two calls he complained for the first time about issues with his heart, of an irregular heartbeat and occasional numbness in his arm.""

Harrison Li said the prison doctor gave his father a blood pressure test and prescribed him a blood thinner, but would not respond to requests for a more thorough medical examination.

He added that Kai Li is careful in phone calls and letters, reminding his family that they are ""closely monitored.""

Kai Li in 2015 off the Long Island Sound, New York. Born in Shanghai, Li emigrated to the US in 1989 and became an American citizen.

Coronavirus complications

As well as heart issues, Harrison Li said the coronavirus had become a concern for his father in recent months. While it is largely under control in China, prisons have been sites of significant outbreaks in the country and around the world, due to crowded conditions and poor sanitation.

Though so far Kai Li has remained coronavirus free, the pandemic has affected him in other ways.

""The level of nutrition at the prison has gone down significantly,"" the younger Li said. ""There's no longer any fruits or vegetables in the diet or even available for purchase anymore. He asked to be able to get multivitamins, or even to buy them at the commissary, but that has been rejected.""

Harrison Li said the pandemic has also essentially cut Kai Li, and other foreign prisoners, off from the outside world, with no consular visits allowed since the virus began spreading in China in January.

In an email, a US State Department official confirmed this, saying the Chinese government ""suspended all in-person visits to detention centers and prisons on January 23, 2020 in order to reduce the spread of COVID-19.""

""The Department of State has no higher priority than the safety and welfare of US citizens overseas,"" the official added. ""During this suspension, our consular officers have been able to reach most U.S. citizen prisoners serving their sentences in China by phone in lieu of in-person consular visits. The US Mission China team continues to seek access to all persons in custody, and will resume regular in-person visits to detained U.S. citizens in accordance with guidance from health authorities once the Chinese government lifts its restrictions on consular visits.""

Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor have been detained in China on state security charges since 2018.

'Painful ordeal'

In a letter to Trump in February last year, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and other lawmakers urged the President to be a ""vociferous advocate"" for Kai Li's release.

""This painful ordeal has gone on for far too long and caused immeasurable harm to Mr. Li and immense pain for his family in New York,"" the lawmakers wrote.

At that time, negotiations were still progressing towards a US-China trade deal . However since then, relations between the two countries have taken a marked turn for the worse -- particularly since the beginning of the corovanirus pandemic, which the Trump administration has sought to blame on Beijing.

""US-China negotiations seem to be hitting new lows everyday,"" Harrison Li said. He added that it was encouraging to see US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's recent meeting with a top Chinese diplomat in Hawaii , but whether those talks will result in progress remains to be seen.

""As Secretary Pompeo has previously met with the loved ones of many Americans wrongfully detained abroad, I hope to get the opportunity to plead my father's case to him directly in the near future,"" Li added.

Kai Li is the only US citizen held on state security charges. His son compared his case to that of two Canadians, Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig, who were this week officially charged with espionage . The two Canadians were detained in 2018, following the arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver.

""My father is part of a broader pattern of the Chinese government charging foreign citizens on state security charges,"" Harrison Li said. ""It really highlights the danger for Americans looking to do business in China.""

People may see headlines about the two Canadians, he said, but ""this happens to Americans too.""

He fears that danger could soon extend beyond mainland China. The country's parliament, the National People's Congress (NPC), is due to impose a national security law on Hong Kong in the coming weeks , criminalizing separatism, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces.

Carrie Lam, the city's chief executive, has said the law would ensure ""the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong,"" with the proposed bill ""in line with the (city's) rule of law.""

But Harrison Li said it could result in ""political prosecutions.""

""(My father's) detention illustrates that China's national security laws are inherently arbitrary and can be used to exploit foreign citizens for political leverage,"" he said. ""That's something important for Americans to be aware of.""

Rishi Iyengar,"San Francisco (CNN Business) For decades, Silicon Valley giants shut out of China by the country's massive censorship apparatus have continued to operate in Hong Kong thanks to the city's unique political status that guaranteed it a free internet.

But a new law that gives Hong Kong authorities sweeping powers to regulate online content could put those companies on a collision course with that censorship mechanism, known as the Great Firewall — and potentially force them out of Hong Kong altogether.

Under the national security law that went into effect last week, Hong Kong police can demand that online platforms and network providers take down content deemed a threat to China's security or restrict access to their services. If they fail to do so, company representatives could face nearly $13,000 in fines and six months in prison.

That has big implications for tech companies that use the city as a regional base thanks to its relative openness and proximity to China and the Asia Pacific region, even if its approximately 7 million residents don't make up a significant portion of their users.

""It is not a huge market, but is important symbolically,"" said Adam Segal, director of the digital and cyberspace policy program at the Council on Foreign Relations.

Caught in the middle

""Firms would be worried by the impact it has on their users, staff, and executives — as well as global concerns that they would be actively facilitating human rights abuse happening under that framework,"" said Raman Jit Singh Chima, Asia policy director at technology advocacy group Access Now. Chima and other experts say companies are likely to wait and see how far China will go in its crackdown on Hong Kong's internet, but exits from the city remain a possibility.

""They may wait to see if the government makes a request, but then they will be forced to decide, and leaving is likely,"" Segal said.

The vaguely worded law also has a provision that states it would also apply to offenses from outside the region ""by a person who is not a permanent resident,"" potentially giving China the ability to take action against any post against Hong Kong on any platform, anywhere.

""I think that is meant to have a general chilling effect on people everywhere, not just not particularly high tech companies,"" said Scott Kennedy, an expert on China's economic policy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

And while that could lead to a degree of self-censorship overseas, Kennedy says there are questions about China's ability to actually enforce its rules on tech platforms outside its own territory.

""That's something that's a vast overreach by the Chinese, and I think they'd generate more pushback,"" he added.

Facebook, Twitter and Microsoft said they will continue to examine the law and its implications on their businesses.

""Our teams are reviewing the law to assess its implications, particularly as some of the terms of the law are vague and without clear definition,"" a Twitter spokesperson said in a statement.

A Facebook spokesperson said the company would conduct a ""further assessment"" of the law in consultation with human rights experts. ""We believe freedom of expression is a fundamental human right and support the right of people to express themselves without fear for their safety or other repercussions,"" the spokesperson added.

""As we would with any new legislation, we are reviewing the new law to understand its implications,"" a Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement.

Google, which also has operations and users in Hong Kong, did not respond to requests for comment.

Apple AAPL While those three companies are largely cut off from mainland China, the law could also have implications for firms, such asand Microsoft, that have a lot more at stake, according to Steven Feldstein, a nonresident fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Both companies have large manufacturing bases for their hardware products in China, which is also one of the world's biggest markets for iPhones.

""These companies, particularly Apple, are really interesting because they have a lot more to lose, particularly given the amount of hardware that they sell in terms of iPhones as well as their manufacturing,"" Feldstein said. ""I don't know exactly where they're going to end up ... short of a lot of public pressure, it's easy to conceive of a scenario where they try to also muddle their way through.""

Apple has found itself caught between China and Hong Kong in the past, most recently last October when it removed a mapping app from its App Store that the city's pro-democracy protesters were using to track police movements.

The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday, but said in a statement to Bloomberg earlier this week that it was ""assessing"" the law.

Safe harbor

Hong Kong's internet freedom is a product of a 1997 agreement between China and Britain, which handed the territory back to the Chinese government under a principle known as "" one country, two systems "" whereby the city would ""safeguard the rights and freedoms of its residents"" for a period of 50 years. But Beijing has been tightening its grip on those rights and freedoms for several years, and many fear the national security law is another big step in that direction. Several countries including the US UK and Australia have criticized the law, with some warning their citizens against visiting Hong Kong because of it.

""It's clear that the Chinese didn't want to pass it simply to create the illusion that they controlled Hong Kong,"" said Kennedy. ""They really want to control Hong Kong and change the facts on the ground.""

Many tech firms could now be eying an exit, with analysts pointing to Singapore as one of the prime alternatives if they are forced to leave Hong Kong. Many tech firms already have a presence in Singapore, though the Southeast Asian country has its own issues with free speech

""If [Hong Kong is] a regional hub for you, or you're there specifically because of the safe harbor it provides due to rule of law ... it's a challenge for you,"" Kennedy said. ""I wouldn't be surprised If every single [US company in Hong Kong] is considering their options about location, and the same for all of their employees.""

In the meantime, Hong Kong is getting a taste — if not the full impact just yet — of life within the Great Firewall, and companies will be on their guard.

""Even Hong Kong lawyers are unable to provide clear advice or guidelines on what would amount to an offense — the provisions are so broadly crafted that they are capable of capturing even benign conduct such as slogans,"" said Sharron Fast, deputy director of the journalism graduate program at the University of Hong Kong.

""Censorship is coming,"" she added, ""and if the breathtaking pace at which we have seen implementation ... is any indication, it will happen sooner rather than later.""",Hong Kong was a 'safe harbor' for tech companies shut out of China.

Brian Fung,"(CNN Business) The short-form video app TikTok could soon see a shakeup of its corporate structure as it confronts mounting criticism from politicians in the US over ties to its Chinese parent company.

TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, is considering establishing a headquarters for the video app outside of China or a new management board to distance the service from the country, according to the Wall Street Journal , citing a source familiar with the matter.

A TikTok spokesperson confirmed Thursday that its parent company is weighing changes to its corporate structure.

""As we consider the best path forward, ByteDance is evaluating changes to the corporate structure of its TikTok business,"" the spokesperson said in a statement provided to CNN Business. ""We remain fully committed to protecting our users' privacy and security as we build a platform that inspires creativity and brings joy for hundreds of millions of people around the world. We will move forward in the best interest of our users, employees, artists, creators, partners, and policymakers.""

US politicians have raised concerns about TikTok as a potential national security risk, claiming that Chinese national security laws could give Beijing access to data on TikTok's American users. President Donald Trump said Tuesday his administration is ""looking at"" banning the app, affirming remarks on Monday by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

Faith Karimi,"(CNN) After a week of skyrocketing coronavirus cases in the United States, officials are issuing a stark warning this July Fourth: Skip the parties.

If you really have to go, wear a mask, wash your hands and maintain social distancing. And if you must host, try to keep festivities outdoors and save the partygoers' information for future contact tracing if needed.

Coronavirus cases have been rising in 36 states with California, Arizona, Texas and Florida all posting record numbers of new infections this week.

The Florida Department of Health reported 11,445 new cases of Covid-19 on Saturday -- yet another record for new coronavirus cases reported in a single day. The previous record was set on Thursday, with 10,109 cases.

Nationwide, the virus has killed more than 129,000 people and infected over 2.8 million since the pandemic started, according to Johns Hopkins University. And for the third straight day Friday, the number of new cases surpassed 50,000 nationwide.

Despite the bleak milestones, President Donald Trump said Saturday that 99% of coronavirus cases ""are totally harmless"" and the rising number of cases are caused by increased testing.

""Now we have tested, almost 40 million people. By so doing, we show cases -- 99% of which are totally harmless — results that no other country can show because no other country has testing that we have. Not in terms of the numbers, or in terms of the quality,"" Trump said during remarks on the White House South Lawn.

Of the 36 states whose new cases have gone up this week compared to the previous one, nine of them have increased by over 50%. They are Montana, Idaho, Nevada, Florida, Georgia, Tennessee, Louisiana, Alaska and Delaware.

People yearning for some normalcy hosted barbecues, found crowds in Virginia Beach, Virginia, and attended gatherings to watch fireworks. Meanwhile, others were finding beaches in Miami and Los Angeles closed, tubing in Texas rivers banned and some city celebrations happening mostly on livestreams.

Fireworks light up the sky on June 30 in New York City, part of July Fourth displays in locations around the city that are kept secret to minimize crowds gathering due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Without stringent safety measures, health experts fear the holiday weekend could bring a wave of new infections that could overwhelm hospitals. To avoid a public health disaster, they're imploring people to wear masks, skip bars and crowded places, and avoid mixing with people outside of their households.

""What we know is that our behavior is the most powerful tool we have right now against the virus,"" said Dr. Nadine Burke Harris, surgeon general of California. ""And we really need folks to, you know, step up. I know that folks are tired, but it's absolutely critically important.""

Some beaches open for revelers, others stay closed

Beaches in Huntington Beach, California, would typically be packed with beachgoers this weekend. Just two weeks ago on June 14, photos showed the beach packed with people, towels and umbrellas.

But on Saturday, beaches in the Los Angeles area are closed due to rising Covid-19 cases, and beaches were left empty with large stretches of untouched white sand.

A normally crowded beach in Huntington Beach, California, is empty on July 4, 2020.

Renee Van Arsdale, who was riding bikes with her husband near the beach, told CNN there would usually be a ""sea of people"" on the beach for July Fourth.

""But today it's mostly locals just enjoying the beauty of the beach instead of being on the beach,"" she said.

Her husband, Gary Van Arsdale, pointed out that the city of Huntington Beach had to cancel its annual July Fourth parade. Instead, the city put on a neighborhood tour with small-vehicle caravans that weaved through the streets with local dignitaries.

Revelers enjoy the beach at Coney Island in the Brooklyn borough of New York on Saturday, July 4, 2020.

Beaches were open elsewhere, like New York's Coney Island. There were also beachgoers at Clearwater Beach in Florida, though there were fewer than typical for the holiday weekend.

At Clearwater, some had gathered in groups, according to a CNN crew on the scene, despite signs on the beach that warned not to gather in groups of 10 or more. But many at the beach told CNN they were taking certain precautions like wearing masks and having hand sanitizer at the ready.

Local resident Connor Gourley — who believed he had the coronavirus earlier in the year and recovered — told CNN he wasn't ""necessarily concerned"" about being on the beach. He wasn't going to let concerns about the virus stop him from celebrating Independence Day, he said.

""It's not more about the partying, it's about celebrating America and our Independence Day,"" he said. ""So, no matter what we're going to be out here and we're going to be American and enjoy our freedom.""

Some officials have made small exceptions for July Fourth festivities, so long as people adhere to restrictions. In Harris County, Texas, Judge Lina Hidalgo issued a countywide order prohibiting outdoor gatherings of 10 or more except for a handful of activities, including fireworks.

The order, signed Friday, says fireworks displays and gatherings with more than 100 people are allowed only if people view the celebrations from inside a vehicle. The order will remain in effect through at least Wednesday, August 26. It also includes exceptions for gatherings of 10 or more people at religious services, youth camps, swimming pools and certain sporting events.

""I think this is the real challenge we have,"" Dr. Umair Shah, executive director of Harris County Public Health, told CNN Saturday. ""It's 4th of July now. All of us should be coming together as Americans to fight this pandemic. It is not just going to go away.""

Health care workers make plea to governor

In Georgia, where coronavirus cases are going up, about 1,400 health care workers signed a letter to Gov. Brian Kemp asking him to increase state restrictions to slow the spread of the coronavirus.

The letter dated Thursday urged the governor to close bars and nightclubs and prohibit indoor gatherings of more than 25 people, including at places of worship. It also recommends a statewide face covering requirement that allows mayors and county officials to institute requirements appropriate for their jurisdictions.

""During the past week we have seen a sharp spike in cases that cannot be accounted for by increased testing. We also are seeing a very troubling increase in hospitalizations that, if continuing, will overwhelm our healthcare infrastructure, not only in metro Atlanta but also in rural Georgia,"" the letter said.

Dr. Jesse Couk, the chair of infectious disease at Shepherd Center and a doctor at Piedmont Atlanta Hospital, told CNN he worked with other doctors and health care professionals to create the letter after he became frustrated with lack of action after a spike in cases.

Couk and other medical contacts worked together to create the letter and have other health care professionals sign it. He said he wanted to highlight the need for increased social distancing and further restrictions to slow the spread and was speaking as a member of the Infectious Disease Society of Georgia and not as a representative of Piedmont Atlanta.

Health care workers push a patient from the Covid-19 unit at United Memorial Medical Center in Houston.

More states make sweeping mask mandates

""We have the ability to keep businesses open and move our economy forward so that Texans can continue to earn a paycheck, but it requires each of us to do our part ... and that means wearing a face covering in public spaces,"" Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said.

Other governors have also issued statewide orders, including California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois and Michigan. And in Tennessee, Gov. Bill Lee signed an executive order granting mayors in 89 counties the authority to issue mask requirements. It allows local governments to issue the mandates if a surge requires more preventative measures.

""While our densely populated urban areas continue to have the highest Covid-19 case rates, our local governments expressed a need for greater flexibility in addressing a rise in cases and that includes setting stronger expectations around masks,"" Lee said in a statement. ""This targeted approach ensures we protect both lives and livelihoods and safely keep our economy open in Tennessee.""

In Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, the beaches will be open to thousands of visitors for the holiday weekend — but with a mask requirement to help stop the spread, Mayor Brenda Bethune said.

US commercial labs report testing delays

Rising demand for Covid-19 testing has led some major commercial laboratories to report delays in turning around test results.

Testing demands have reached ""unprecedented levels,"" commercial laboratory Quest Diagnostics said this week, leading to delays in notifying clients of their results.

Although Quest can provide results within a day for priority patients — including sick health care workers and people in the hospital — the average turnaround time is three to five days for most other patients, the company said in a statement Monday.

While the number of tests conducted across the US is increasing, experts say long turnaround times can make it difficult to isolate confirmed cases and quickly quarantine their close contacts.

Another commercial laboratory, LabCorp, is reporting delays. The company told CNN in a statement Saturday that reporting test results may take one to two days longer now, leading to a current turnaround time of two to four days on average.

""In recent weeks, we have seen a steady increase in demand for molecular testing and we are doing everything we can to continue delivering results in a timely manner while continually increasing testing capacity,"" LabCorp said.","As coronavirus cases skyrocket, US marks July Fourth with pleas for people to skip the parties",https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/04/health/us-coronavirus-saturday/index.html,2020-07-04
Faith Karimi,"(CNN) As Americans find some beaches closed and Fourth of July fireworks scarce , authorities fear the holiday weekend may worsen the already ravaging coronavirus pandemic .

More than two months after the first peak affected just a handful of states, the virus is cresting again across the South and Southwest.

The US reported Friday at least 51,842 new cases, marking the third day straight with a daily high of more than 50,000 cases, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

Those who have not given up celebrating America's independence outdoors are finding that beaches in Miami and Los Angeles have been closed, tubing in Texas rivers has been banned and city-sponsored celebrations will be live-streamed.

After crowds were gathering at Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, on Friday, Mayor Brenda Bethune said officials were working to get the message out that masks are needed.

""People spread this virus and we can't stop people from coming here but we all have personal responsibility in helping to prevent the spread of this virus,"" Bethune told CNN's Jim Acosta.

California, Arizona, Texas and Florida all posted record new cases this week -- Florida reported nearly 9,500 additional coronavirus cases on Friday. Texas had 7,555 new cases after back-to-back days with about 8,000 a piece.

Florida is averaging more new cases per day -- 7,870 -- than any other state, according to a CNN analysis of data from Johns Hopkins University. California and Texas trail close behind.

""There's nothing more American than making a sacrifice by staying home to keep a family member safe, a neighbor safe or a stranger safe,"" Miami Beach Mayor Dan Gelber told CNN.

Nearly two dozen states have paused their reopenings to combat the spread while others have taken extra measures to keep it out of their borders. New York, New Jersey and Connecticut issued a travel advisory that requires people arriving from eight states with high coronavirus rates to quarantine for two weeks.

Here are other significant developments this week:

A man and a girl hear a band outside a music venue in Nashville, Tenn. The Nashville Health Department has a mask mandate to help battle the spread of the coronavirus.

Masks alone cannot help combat coronavirus

Some state leaders and experts have blamed the spike in cases on more testing.

""What we're seeing now in the Southwest is a surge in both the number of positive cases and the percentage of people testing who are positive,"" Dr. Jonathan Reiner, a CNN medical analyst and professor of medicine at George Washington University, said on Friday.

But others experts attributed it to a lack of a comprehensive response.

""If you turn your back on the virus, if you turn your back on science, it's going to bite you,"" said Dr. Thomas Frieden, the former director for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The virus, he told CNN, cannot be stopped by a single measure.

""Whether it's restricting travel or staying home or testing a lot of people or wearing a mask. And those are all important, but none of them, in and of themselves are going to control this,"" he said.

Officials fear July Fourth could bring a surge in cases, and are urging Americans to limit their festivities. The holiday weekend could be the ""perfect storm"" for new cases, said Dr. Joshua Barocas, an infectious disease physician at Boston Medical Center.

Coronavirus has killed more than 129,000 people and infected over 2.7 million nationwide, according to Johns Hopkins University. As infection rates continue rising in 36 states, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is projecting nearly 148,000 deaths in the US by the end of the month.

No social distancing at President Trump's event

The President and first lady Melania Trump went to Mount Rushmore National Memorial on Friday for an early Fourth of July celebration expected to be attended by 7,500 people.

No social distancing is planned for the event.

""We told those folks that have concerns that they can stay home, but those who want to come and join us, we'll be giving out free face masks if they choose to wear one,"" Republican Gov. Kristi Noem told Fox News.

CNN medical analyst Dr. Celine Gounder said holding such an event during a pandemic is ""beyond irresponsible.""

""This is the behavior of a cult leader who is jumping off the cliff but he is jumping into a safety net -- with protections around him,"" she said of the President. ""While he asks the followers to jump off a cliff into nothing.""

Coronavirus cases in South Dakota currently remain stable, according to data from Johns Hopkins University, with 6,893 confirmed cases and 97 deaths as of Thursday. But it's unclear how many attendees will travel from other states.

One Michigan bar. At least 158 coronavirus cases

Now, at least 158 coronavirus infections have been linked to that bar, Ingham County Health Officer Linda Vail told CNN on Friday.

Crowding, shouting, long lines and drinking combined to create ""a perfect storm,"" she said.

""It's really hard to contain when young people are reckless and don't think it's going to affect them, much less those high-risk people around them,"" Vail said.

Virus has mutated to become more infectious

The warnings of health officials are especially relevant following new research that the virus has mutated to become more infectious

A global study found strong evidence a new form of coronavirus has spread from Europe to the US. The new mutation makes the virus more likely to infect people but does not seem to make patients any sicker than previous variations, according to an international team of researchers.

""It is now the dominant form infecting people,"" said Erica Ollmann Saphire of the La Jolla Institute for Immunology and the Coronavirus Immunotherapy Consortium, who worked on the study. ""This is now the virus.""

The study was published in the journal Cell.

US to be placed on UK travel 'red list'

The UK government is expected to designate the United States as a ""red list"" travel destination due to concerns over the soaring US infection rate, UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said.

""Here, we've got things under control, but we know [the virus] is still raging in parts of the world, Shapps told BBC Radio 4. ""So, I'm afraid there is a red list.""

""The US, from a very early stage, banned flights from the UK and from Europe, so there isn't a reciprocal arrangement in place,"" he added, noting the US still has a ""very high"" rate of infection.

Thousands more deaths projected this month

The CDC now projects nearly 148,000 coronavirus deaths in the United States by July 25.

Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams urged caution about the death rate for the virus remaining flat while the number of new cases increases.

""We know deaths lag at least two weeks and can lag even more,"" Adams said Friday on ""Fox & Friends.""

""In the beginning, nursing homes were hit really hard, and the majority of our deaths were occurring on people who were 60, 65 and older. Now the majority of cases are in people who have an average age of 35.""

He added, ""What we're really worried about -- particularly with young people -- is that they get it and then they spread it to their grandmother, to their grandfather.""

The new projections estimate a range of 139,000 to 161,000 deaths.

""The state-level ensemble forecasts suggest that the number of new deaths over the next four weeks in Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Idaho, Nevada, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, Texas, Utah and Wyoming will likely exceed the number reported over the last four weeks,"" the CDC said.

More states make sweeping mask mandates

When mask mandates for Texas and Kansas go into effect Friday, 19 states and Washington, DC , will have such requirements.

In a major change, Texas won't allow people who are in counties with 20 or more active Covid-19 cases to go out without a face covering. That's about 95% of Texans.

""We have the ability to keep businesses open and move our economy forward so that Texans can continue to earn a paycheck, but it requires each of us to do our part ... and that means wearing a face covering in public spaces,"" Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said.

On Friday, cell phones in the state received an alert advising people to wear masks in public spaces.

""Punishable by a $250 fine,"" the alert read.

Other governors have also issued statewide orders, including California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois and Michigan.

The cause of the current spike in cases is impossible to pinpoint, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. But a series of events that occurred simultaneously, including protests, Memorial Day festivities and states reopening, likely contributed, he told the Harvard Business Review.

Of the 36 states whose new cases have gone up this week compared to the previous one, nine of them have increased by over 50%. They are Montana, Idaho, Nevada, Florida, Georgia, Tennessee, Louisiana, Alaska and Delaware.","US reports over 50,000 new coronavirus cases for third straight day",https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/03/health/us-coronavirus-friday/index.html,2020-07-03
Stella Chan,"(CNN) A Nigerian man nicknamed ""Ray Hushpuppi"" who flaunted his Rolls Royces, fancy watches and designer clothing on Instagram faces money laundering conspiracy charges in the United States, according to the Department of Justice.

Ramon Olorunwa Abbas appeared in a federal court in Chicago on Friday. He is accused of conspiring to launder hundreds of millions of dollars through cybercrime schemes.

According to a federal affidavit, one of the alleged victims was the client of a New York-based law firm that lost nearly a million dollars in 2019.

Abbas was arrested last month by law enforcement officials in the United Arab Emirates and transferred to the US this week by the FBI.

Prosecutors allege Abbas is one of the leaders of a global network that uses computer intrusions, business email compromise (BEC) schemes and money laundering capers to steal hundreds of millions of dollars.

Nyasha Chingono,"Harare, Zimbabwe (CNN) The shooting of two Zimbabwean workers by a Chinese boss shows the ""systematic and widespread"" abuse that locals face in Chinese mining operations, says the Zimbabwe Environmental Law Society (ZELA).

In a court affidavit, police said Zhang Xuen shot an employee five times and wounded another at the mine he runs in Gweru province, in central Zimbabwe, during a row with workers over outstanding pay.

Zhang has been charged with attempted murder, said Zimbabwe police spokesman Paul Nyathi.

According to local media reports , Zhang did not enter a plea because there was no approved interpreter in court. He will remain in custody until at least July 7, the report said.

The shooting happened on Sunday morning, when miner Kenneth Tachiona confronted Zhang after he allegedly refused to pay his wages in US dollars, as agreed, according to the affidavit.

Tachiona charged toward Zhang, who then drew his gun, shooting the worker three times on his right thigh and twice on the left, according to the affidavit.

Police said Zhang fired another shot at workers, and one of the bullets grazed the chin of a member of staff. The wounded workers are being treated at a private hospital.

A video that many alleged to be of the incident has circulated on social media in Zimbabwe, provoking public anger and calls from a local watchdog for a re-evaluation of Chinese mining operations in the country.

Remarks by the Spokesperson of the Chinese Embassy in Zimbabwe pic.twitter.com/cRk0Jc2J46 — Chinese Embassy in Zimbabwe (@ChineseZimbabwe) June 22, 2020

The Chinese Embassy in Zimbabwe described the shooting as an isolated incident and said it was in support of an open and transparent probe by local authorities.

""Any possible illegal acts and persons who violate the law should not be shielded. China and Zimbabwe have a long-standing friendship and cooperation. We call upon all relevant sides to safeguard it jealousy and carefully,"" the Chinese Embassy said in a statement on Twitter.

The Chinese Foreign Ministry told CNN: ""Overall, Chinese companies in Zimbabwe have operated their businesses in accordance with local laws and regulations, and made positive contributions to Zimbabwe's economic and social development.

""We respect Zimbabwe's handling of the case in accordance with law, but at the same time hope to see Zimbabwe protect the safety as well as legitimate rights and interests of Chinese nationals. There is traditional friendship between the two countries and we believe both sides will be able to properly handle this case.""

Dangerous conditions

China is Zimbabwe's largest foreign investor with significant interests in the country's extractive sector.

Last year, Chinese firm Tsignchan signed a $2 billion deal with the Zimbabwean Ministry of Mines to extract chrome, iron ore, nickel and coal, vital resources for China.

At least 10,000 Chinese people are in Zimbabwe, and many are working on in the country's mining, telecoms, and construction sectors on a contractual basis, according to a 2016 Brookings Institution report

But their presence in the country has sometimes been controversial.

Both Chinese-run mines in the country and state mining operations have been dogged with allegations of human rights violations and poor safety measures for staff.

In February, a group of local miners in Matabeleland South province petitioned a labor court to protest their firing by their Chinese employer.

Last April, workers at another Chinese mining operation in the province complained of being underpaid and working without protective clothing.

Several cases of Chinese miners refusing to pay salaries or provide their workers with protective clothing, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic, are currently being investigated by ZELA, according to its deputy director Shamiso Mutisi

""It has become a pattern and a system. We have cases where miners are abused, beaten, and discriminated against by Chinese miners,"" Mutisi said.

In a statement on Wednesday, ZELA said locals in some Chinese-owned mines often operate ""dangerous, harsh, and life-threatening"" conditions, while being paid poorly for their time.

Sunday's shooting is another reason for the government to rethink its political and economic engagements with China, the group said.

""In many parts of Africa, including Zimbabwe, Chinese mining investors have exhibited a history of bad safety, health, environmental, labor, and human rights standards,"" the statement said.

CNN has contacted China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs for comment.

The Chinese community in Gweru has distanced itself from the recent incident and promised to pay for injured workers' medical bills and support their families as they deal with the issue.

The Chinese community said in a statement the incident does not reflect the behavior of its members, and they have engaged the company to compensate the workers.

""We sincerely hope that our friendship and cooperation between the two countries and two peoples will not be sullied by this isolated incident, which does not reflect the behavior of us all as the Chinese community,"" the statement read.","Shooting of Zimbabwe workers by Chinese mine owner shows 'systemic' abuse, watchdog says",https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/27/africa/zimbabwe-mine-shooting-intl/index.html,2020-06-27
Bukola Adebayo,"CNN is committed to covering gender inequality wherever it occurs in the world. This story is part of As Equals, an ongoing series.

Lagos, Nigeria -- At the start of each day, Dr. Anita Kemi DaSilva-Ibru and her team put on gloves, facemasks and other personal protective equipment to see their patients.

They're not treating people for Covid-19, but they are on the frontline of the pandemic, working at the Women at Risk International Foundation (WARIF), a rape crisis center in Lagos, Nigeria.

Wearing protective gear is the new reality for crisis center workers, like DaSilva-Ibru.

""We change these kits each time we see a survivor as we are mindful of the risk of transmission of the virus between the survivor and us and the cross-contamination between a survivor and the next,"" she told CNN.

US-trained gynecologist DaSilva-Ibru has spent most of her career treating hundreds of sexual violence victims but it was the growing scale of the crisis in Nigeria that prompted her to set up WARIF in 2016.

The clinic in Yaba, a suburb of Lagos, provides medical treatment, legal assistance therapy and space for rape victims and survivors of sexual abuse to get back on their feet.

One in four Nigerian girls has been the victim of sexual violence, according to UN estimates but DaSilva-Ibru says the numbers are higher as many cases go unreported due to the stigma attached.

In recent weeks, two high profile cases of gender-based violence have brought Nigerian women out onto the streets demanding change.

Uwaila Vera Omozuwa, a 22-year-old microbiology student, was found half-naked in a pool of blood in a local church where she had gone to study after the Covid-19 lockdown left universities across the country shut.

""Rape is an epidemic in this country."" Dr. Anita Kemi DaSilva-Ibru, Women at Risk International Foundation

Her family said her attackers raped her and the student died while being treated at the hospital. A few days later, another student, Barakat Bello, was allegedly raped and killed during a robbery at her home, according to human rights group Amnesty International.

""Rape is an epidemic in this country,"" DaSilva-Ibru told CNN.

She says her work with survivors of sexual violence has become more critical during the outbreak, with restrictions to curb the virus from spreading fueling a surge in calls.

It's a story echoed in other parts of the region, as authorities grapple with a growing number of Covid-19 cases and the impact restrictions are having on women.

DaSilva-Ibru said she initially closed the center after authorities locked down the city in March, she had to reconsider the decision as the organization became inundated with SOS messages from sexual violence victims and their guardians.

Staff operating the 24-hour helpline at the center also reported a 64% increase in calls during this period, according to DaSilva-Ibru.

""Our phones were ringing. Women were calling and desperately asking how we can help them, these were women in fear of their lives, as many have now been forced into quarantine with their abusers, in an already volatile environment,"" DaSilva-Ibru told CNN.

For the center to re-open, DaSilva-Ibru said she had to source PPE, face masks and other protective gear personally and when that was not enough, the center launched an online appeal for funds from donors to buy the equipment at no cost to survivors, she said.

""We carry out forensic examinations on survivors and our frontline health workers who triage and examine patients are in close proximity to the survivors. As much as we need to carry out our duties, we also need to ensure our workers are adequately protected,"" DaSilva-Ibru told CNN.

The challenges Ibru faces to keep the center open, doesn't compare to what sexual violence victims have experienced as a result of this pandemic, she said.

DaSilva-Ibru recalls a woman who told staff at the center that her male friend had raped her in her home during the lockdown.

Dr. Anita Kemi DaSilva-Ibru.

""The first day we re-opened, we attended to women who had walked many miles in spite of the mandatory lockdown to get to the center. These are women who had been terrorized in their homes,"" she added.

""She (a survivor) had repeatedly been calling (the center) to find out how she could get help. She feared she might have contracted HIV and wanted to be tested,"" Ibru said.

Speaking to CNN, the woman, who didn't want to use her name to protect her identity, said a co-worker raped her after he came to her apartment unannounced in April.

The young banker said she had previously rebuffed his attempts to visit, but on that Sunday afternoon in April, he showed up at her doorstep.

""He's a friend, not a stranger, so I opened the door for him. I was still asking him what was so urgent that made him leave his home. He said he wanted to check up on me and I told him he could have done that over the phone,"" she told CNN.

But a few minutes into his visit, the conversation became uncomfortable between them.

""He kept coming towards me, and when I told him to stop, he put his hand over my mouth and pinned me on the floor,"" she said.

She says he apologized after raping her and hurriedly left her house.

The survivor told CNN she did not make a police complaint because she was worried about the stigma and strain that the rape might have on her parents.

A friend she confided in told her to reach out to the Lagos Domestic and Sexual Violence Response Team who put survivors in touch with treatment centers for help.

After several calls to the centers on their website, she was referred to WARIF

When she went to the clinic, she says staff ran some tests and placed her on Post Exposure Prophylaxis, a HIV prevention treatment for possible exposure.

""Sometimes I get really angry, and sometimes I feel numb,"" she said, reflecting on the assault.

She says she was sick every night for 28 days because of the drugs.

""...even though the doctor prepared me for the side effect, it has not been easy,"" she told CNN.

Gender-based violence is a problem in many countries, but the coronavirus pandemic has worsened the situation.

The UN says the raft of measures deployed by governments to fight the pandemic have led to economic hardship, stress, and fear -- conditions that lead to violence against women and girls.

Equality Now Regional Coordinator in Africa Judy Gitau told CNN that the wave of unemployment and school closures has put victims in a precarious situation.

The government enforced strict stay-at-home orders that closed businesses and schools across the West African nation to curb the spread of the virus, she said.

The restrictions made schoolgirls vulnerable to abuse as some were assaulted in their homes by relatives, and at the same time, a majority of girls from low-income families were coerced to exchange sex for money for food, Gitau said.

""Many of them wound up pregnant but the evidence became available when people were plugging back to life as they knew it as a normal society,"" she said.

Gitau says authorities must know that perpetrators often take advantage of the strict measures to abuse victims without arousing much suspicion.

As state resources are being re-focused to tackle the spread of coronavirus, law enforcement agencies should also respond quickly to reports of abuse and create shelters for victims in need of immediate rescue, she said.

But placing women in shelters, especially in countries battling an outbreak, comes with the additional burden of proof, according to DaSilva-Ibru who said shelters in Lagos city are asking survivors to take coronavirus tests before they can be admitted to prevent infection in their facilities.

""Violence against women and girls is one of the most pervasive forms of a human rights violation and should be recognized by all countries."" Dr. Anita Kemi DaSilva-Ibru, Women at Risk International Foundation

Authorities in Lagos designated gender-based violence services essential in May as it eased lockdown into curfews to allow service providers to get to work more smoothly, DaSilva-Ibru said.

The police force says it has now deployed more officers to its stations across the country to respond to the ""increasing challenges of sexual assaults and domestic/gender-based violence linked with the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic."" And last week, governors across the country resolved to declare a state of emergency on rape , according to the Nigerian Governor's Forum (NGF).

It's the first time federal and state authorities are coming out with a united voice to condemn gender violence, DaSilva-Ibru said and it validates the outcry of women in the country and the scale of the problem in Nigeria, she added.

""Violence against women and girls is one of the most pervasive forms of a human rights violation and should be recognized by all countries,"" DaSilva-Ibru said.

Sarah El Sirgany,"(CNN) Ghasan Saleh starts digging graves at the break of dawn to prepare for the dead bodies that will come in droves. Two men in white hazmat suits appear atop an approaching pickup truck. They hastily drop a corpse into a hole and cover it with dirt.

The health workers come and go in near-silence. Fear of infection means there are no mourners for those suspected to have died from Covid-19.

The cycle of digging and abrupt funerals continues under the blistering sun and suffocating humidity of Aden , the seat of power of the UN-recognized government in war-torn Yemen.

The Al Radwan cemetery has quickly expanded over the past few months, with new graves creeping closer to the residential buildings that border it. ""You can see my digging machine,"" says Saleh. ""Just now I dug 20 graves.""

Local medical authorities say that death rates in Aden are soaring this year, despite a relative lull in a war that ravaged the place in previous years.

The Al Radwan cemetery in Aden has rapidly expanded after a surge in Covid-related deaths.

In the first half of May, the city recorded 950 deaths -- nearly four times as many as the 251 deaths in the whole month of March, according to a Ministry of Health report.

Those 950 deaths in two weeks in May represent nearly half the number of casualties the city suffered in all of 2015, when the country's civil war was raging.

Back then Aden was devastated by heavy fighting, its streets blasted by rockets and its houses peppered with bullets. Now the city's biggest killers are silent.

On top of Covid-19, there's also a mosquito-transmitted virus outbreak, known as Chikungunya virus , and more than 100,000 known cholera cases across the nation. Many malnutrition centers and hospitals have closed due to funding shortfalls and doctors' concerns about their personal safety from coronavirus. Flash floods this spring destroyed the city's power grid.

""Yemen has faced wars and cannot handle three pandemics, economic collapse and a war and the coronavirus,"" Dr. Ishraq Al-Subei, the health official responsible for the response to the disease told CNN.

The official Covid-19 death toll in southern Yemen stands at only 127. Health workers say they don't know what the actual number is, because of low testing capacity. But the huge surge in deaths in Aden is being seen as a warning of worse to come, as the health sector becomes overwhelmed and more people die of treatable diseases.

In pursuit of a hospital bed

Hmeid Mohammed, 38, had an agonizing journey that started with a mild fever at home.

His family couldn't find a hospital to take him to when his fever started to rise rapidly in early May. He was in a coma when he was admitted by the only hospital in Aden designated to treat Covid-19 at the time.

""They brought him back to life,"" his brother-in-law Anwar Motref recalled.

He was diagnosed with meningitis, another disease common in Yemen. As soon as he showed signs of improvement, doctors advised him to leave the hospital to avoid becoming infected with Covid-19.

About a week later, his health deteriorated. Again, the family went to different hospitals in an effort to have him admitted, but with little success. Eventually they found him a bed in an emergency ward that he shared with six other people. Fluid filled his lungs and his kidneys were failing.

The family had the funds for medical treatment, but Aden's hospitals were either closed or full. A hunt for admission to a hospital that could perform surgery and dialysis in time to save him failed.

Mohammed died in late May, robbing his three children and widow of the family's only bread-winner.

""Who is to blame for all of this? We do not have a government or a state or anyone to help us in this country,"" Motref said at the family home in the rocky hills around Aden.

""Who should we complain to? We are tired of this life. Every morning we wake up to hear of 10-15 people who died,"" he added.

Local health officials say Aden recorded an average of 55 daily deaths in May, a significant surge from previous months.

Disappearing aid and a collapsing health sector

The guns in Aden have become quieter in recent months but Yemen's war has not gone away.

Five years of conflict has beggared the nation. Today more than half its population relies on aid to survive.

But the United Nations is now facing a potentially catastrophic shortfall in funds -- around $1 billion -- for this year. It is warning of a collapsing heath sector and the possibility that Yemen's death toll may continue to rise dramatically -- possibly exceeding the total number of dead during five years of war, when the country endured what was considered the world's ""worst humanitarian crisis.""

Fatalities in Aden, the seat of power of Yemen's internationally-recognized government, are poised to exceed its wartime fatalities.

""We are a billion short of our minimum target,"" Lise Grande, the head of the UN's humanitarian operations in Yemen, told CNN. ""So In the time of Covid what this means is that we're going to see approximately half of the hospitals which we are currently supporting in the country closed down -- and that's going to be happening in just the next few weeks.

""A week before the first Covid-19 case was confirmed in Yemen we ran out of money and had to stop allowances for 10,000 frontline health workers across the country. In the middle of Covid, it's devastating,"" she added.

There are just 60 hospital beds dedicated to Covid-19 in Aden, which has a population of roughly 800,000. These are in two hospitals operated by Doctors Without Borders (MSF). The city has 18 ventilators, all constantly in use, according to MSF.

Doctors and aid workers say patients mostly seek hospital treatment in late stages of the disease, when it is likely too late to save them. And in most cases, there is no capacity to treat them.

""Most cases are rejected because there are no available ventilators,"" Dr. Farouk Abduallah Nagy, head of the isolation department at the Gomhuria Hospital, told CNN.

Anwar Motref helped his brother-in-law Hmeid Mohammed find a hospital bed in his last days. Now, Mohammed's children are in his care.

""The health sector was already weak before the outbreak. And it is getting worse and worse. The health sector is collapsing,"" said Caroline Seguin, MSF communications officer in Aden.

Outside the city, the fighting between southern separatists and the government rages on , compounding the effects of the ongoing five-year war between Houthi rebels in the north and the fractious coalition backed by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in the south.

More than 112,000 people have been killed in airstrikes, shelling and bombing, according to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED).

Hundreds of thousands of people have been driven into camps as refugees from the war. There they face the risks of endemic disease, malnutrition, and overcrowding -- all ideal conditions for the spread of a disease like Covid-19.

Mokhtar Ahmed, originally from the port city of Hodeidah in the north, came to a camp on the outskirts of Aden three years ago.

""Cholera and the wars are one thing and corona is something else,"" he told CNN, flanked by his two children.

Tamara Qiblawi,"Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) A young man with a swagger approaches a dumpster. An employee from a nearby restaurant has just dumped a trash bag inside. He scoops the bag up, rummaging through it to look for leftover hummus and beans. Finding a half-smoked cigarette, he lights it, and puts it to his lips. Then, wiping his hands on his black shirt, he pokes his head into the container one last time, to check there's nothing else he can use, before walking away.

Two blocks away, on Beirut's bustling Hamra Street, a baby stroller lies atop a pile of garbage bags. ""What do you think? Could we use this?"" A veiled, middle-aged woman asks her young daughter. The woman holds up the contraption, examining its contorted pink rods.

Across the country, elderly couples sift through refuse together, and young men scrounge for clothes and shoes to bring back to their families.

Many of them cower when approached by cameras and journalists. ""Please, just go to the other side of the street. Go far away,"" one man, searching through a Beirut dumpster, told a CNN crew.

For many of those scavenging for goods in Lebanon , poverty is a new, and bitter, experience.

A man dismantles and sorts through discarded electric devices at a scrap workshop in the Bab al-Tabbaneh neighborhood of Lebanon's northern city of Tripoli on June 3, 2020.

As Lebanon entered a Covid-induced lockdown earlier this year, the destruction of the middle class remained largely out of sight, but now, as it reopens, there's no escaping the dystopian scenes of desperation repeated across the country.

Nearly every day, the snowball effect of Lebanon's economic meltdown brings new developments. For weeks, the country's currency has been in free-fall, losing 60% of its value in the last month alone.

People's life savings, locked up by the banks' discretionary capital controls, imposed since November, are largely believed to have gone up in smoke.

Doctors and university professors who, just a few months ago, were considered upper-middle class are now making the equivalent of a few hundred dollars a month.

Meanwhile, prices have surged -- the situation is verging on hyper-inflation -- and fuel shortages have plunged the country into darkness, with power outages lasting almost 24 hours.

The capital city of Beirut remains in darkness during a power outage on Monday, July 6, 2020.

""It feels very hopeless,"" said Carmen Geha, an activist and associate professor of public administration at the American University of Beirut. ""You're sitting and waiting and every day it gets worse, and the people around you get worse.

""It feels like you're waiting for the end of the world, with people eating out of garbage cans and people stealing from pharmacies,"" she added, recalling one recent armed robbery of diapers at a pharmacy. Diapers are prohibitively expensive for many in Lebanon.

""I didn't think it was going to be this bad,"" she said. ""I didn't think we would be living in a jungle.""

Less than nine months ago, the country swelled with acts of indignation against a political elite widely accused of corruption. Protesters demanding the downfall of Lebanon's sectarian leadership forced nationwide road closures, and patriotic anthems blasted from speakers set up at makeshift protest sites likened to social utopias.

Fast forward to today, and the contrast is stark.

The flurry of small demonstrations that continue to crop up around the country receives scant media attention. Instead, a string of recent suicides dominates conversations, and the atmosphere is solemn.

Half-empty cafes and restaurants play music at low volume, and social media pages that would normally be advertising summer parties and carnivals now issue a rapid succession of calls for solidarity and humanitarian relief.

Last Friday, a man shot and killed himself near a Dunkin Donuts branch in the middle of a busy street. He had prepared a sign, reading: ""I am not a heretic,"" in reference to a well-known Lebanese leftist song, and an apparent reference to religious taboos around suicide. The verse continues: ""But hunger is heresy.""

Even attempts to lighten the mood appear only to have succeeded in deepening people's sorrow.

On Sunday, an orchestra inside the ancient city of Baalbeck's Temple of Jupiter -- a venue that once hosted concerts by the likes of Nina Simone and the Egyptian diva Um Kulthoum -- played to an empty hall. The concert, entitled ""The Sound of Resilience,"" was broadcast across the country.

But as a light show beamed out from the concert hall to the soaring notes of Carmina Burana, a drone camera rose above the majestic temple, showing the vibrant colors glowing amid the pitch-black darkness of yet another power outage. Many saw this as funeral dirge for a bygone era.

But activists insist that there will be an end to this bleak picture.

Around the country, there is growing anger at a ruling elite that has done little to stymie the country's economic meltdown.

Leading figures in the political class point fingers at each other, jockeying for power. Reforms promised by the government of Prime Minister Hassan Diab, a self-style technocrat, have largely fallen by the wayside.

Negotiations with the International Monetary Fund have stalled after politicians aligned with the country's banking elite torpedoed the government's IMF-endorsed economic program, which had been expected to dig into bank profits.

Lebanese Prime Minister Hassan Diab and Iraq's Oil Minister Ihsan Abdel-Jabbara hold a meeting in Beirut on July 3, 2020.

The international community -- once an active player in Lebanese domestic politics -- has also been largely idle.

US officials have repeatedly signaled that aid would be conditional on Iran-backed Hezbollah's exit from government, where they have had seats since 2005.

International transfers have slowed because more foreign banks are shying away from a Lebanese banking sector riddled with accusations of mismanagement.

Many also suspect that Lebanese banks could be affected by the newly imposed Caesar Act, which sanctions assets from neighboring Syria.

Amine Issa, political coordinator for non-sectarian party The National Bloc, argues that the solution lies in nothing short of political transformation.

He calls the economic meltdown a ""panic-driven collapse,"" prompted by tumbling trust in the political leadership. ""The whole issue is one of trust ... not of supply and demand,"" said Issa.

He believes a boost in political confidence could lead to an economic turnaround: ""If (the leadership) stays then the country goes towards destruction,"" he said, calling up images of an educated middle class preparing to abandon the country, in favor of more promising shores.

""What happened on October 17 was a huge step,"" he said, referring to the popular uprising that began last year. ""There is a new breath, a new conviction, a new awareness that we want to build on.""

Some argue that the relative silence of the protest movement is because activists are busy organizing, coalescing into a political alternative to the current sectarian leadership.

The solutions, activists say, aren't something from a political utopia but lie within the existing legal system, which favors a non-sectarian state.

""We are very different from other Arab regimes because the solution is in our constitution,"" said AUB's Geha. ""We need to activate this system, that's all. It says that there should be a transition into a non-sectarian state.

""This is not like saying we want to bring a regime down because we want freedom. Actually, we're hostages of not having a system,"" she said. ""It is the pursuit of the rule of law.""

Meanwhile, acts of social solidarity are as commonplace as signs of despair.

Analysis Jomana Karadsheh,"(CNN) On what was once a desert minefield separating Jordan from Israel , King Hussein and Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin made history. It was October 1994 and the Jordanian and Israeli leaders were signing a peace deal, turning the page on decades of war and hostility.

The iconic moment was in no small part the result of a shared vision for peace by two men who were said to have a personal chemistry between them. It was a day ""like no other,"" an emotional King Hussein announced. It was ""the dawning of the new era of peace... As we come together to ensure, God willing, that there will be no more death, no more misery, no more suspicion, no more fear, no more uncertainty.""

But 26 years on, that vision looks like an illusion. The survival of the peace treaty -- one of two Israel has with the Arab world -- is now in question.

""We are at ... the lowest level in the relationship ... since the signing of the peace treaty"" Jordan's Prime Minister Omar Razzaz told CNN in March. At the time, it seemed as though the relationship could be salvaged, that Israel and the Trump administration could be dissuaded from making good on promises to annex parts of the West Bank.

Now, while the immediate timetable for annexation might be slipping a bit, Israel still appears to be on the verge of unilaterally proclaiming sovereignty on a patch of land that is a critical part of Jordan's foreign and domestic policy. This has driven the Jordanian sovereign, King Abdullah, into a corner.

The Jordanians share the view of much of the international community when it comes to this issue: annexation of the West Bank, they say, would kill the long-touted two state solution. It would undermine a 2002 Arab peace initiative that outlines a future Palestinian state based on Israel's pre-1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital. The Jordanian monarch has also long believed that there will be no end to the region's turmoil without a resolution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, something that appears to be an ever-dimmer prospect after US President Donald Trump's peace plan failed to bring the Palestinians back to the negotiating table.

But for Jordan, this is not just about peace in the region. The end of the two-state solution would present an existential threat to the Kingdom, rattling its identity and future.

US President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump welcome Jordan's Queen Rania and King Abdullah II outside the West Wing of the White House in April 2017.

A deteriorating relationship with Netanyahu

The relationship between Israel and Jordan has grown more strained with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the helm. Jordanian officials have always been wary of him and his right-wing politics. But a Netanyahu emboldened by Trump's backing has become nearly impossible for Jordanian officials to work with.

According to a Palestinian media report citing a Jordanian official in June, the King didn't take a call from the Israeli PM. Jordanian officials would not confirm or deny the report that was widely circulated in Israeli media.

The Israeli Prime Minister's office said the report is not true.

""The message should be clear: annexation will not go unanswered. For if it does, there will only be a fiercer conflict. Annexation will make the two-state solution an impossibility,"" Jordan's Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi warned at a committee meeting in early June.

The two countries still maintain close ties when it comes to security and intelligence sharing. Historically, Jordan -- while small and resource-poor -- has always been important for Israel. In a hostile neighborhood, Jordan provided Israel with a buffer on its eastern frontier and served as a mediator when Israel needed one.

But now Jordan has its own interests at stake. More than half of Jordan's population of 10 million is of Palestinian descent, and the country is home to more than 2 million registered Palestinian refugees. From a Jordanian perspective, a future Palestinian state would ensure that these refugees would have a right of return and prevents any possibility of a further influx of people. Without that state, Jordan could turn into a de facto state for the Palestinians -- something Jordanians fear is in fact the ultimate aim of right-wing Israelis.

If Netanyahu goes ahead with the plan on or after July 1, the immediate concern for the Jordanians will be quelling anger on their streets, potentially putting King Abdullah in one of the toughest positions of his two-decade rule.

The peace treaty between the two countries never got popular support. Calls have been growing among lawmakers and the public for the Kingdom to abolish the peace treaty and sever ties with Israel.

In May, the monarch told the German publication Der Spiegel that if annexation went ahead it would lead to ""a massive conflict with ... Jordan."" While not going as far as threatening to abrogate the peace treaty, he said all options were being considered. It was his most stark warning to the Israelis yet.

It is not clear what that ""conflict"" would entail but unrest in the Middle East is always an opportunity for extremism to flourish. Additionally, an annexation -- whether partial or total -- vindicates anyone in Jordan who opposed peace with Israel, and gives those who advocated against trusting Israel an opportunity to turn around and say. ""I told you so.""

Trump and Netanyahu take part in an announcement of Trump's Middle East peace plan in the White House on January 28, 2020.

The king's options are limited. His country is heavily reliant on US aid and with a US president who has frequently used aid as leverage and threatened to withhold it from allies, Abdullah would have to tread carefully. Risking US aid would be dangerous for the country, especially with growing public discontent over the state of the economy.

Standing alongside King Abdullah in the White House's Rose Garden in 2017, President Trump showered his key ally with praise and promised to consult with the monarch on an Israeli-Palestinian peace plan. But in the months and years that followed, Abdullah was sidelined and his advice was ignored. Jordanian officials say they only saw the peace plan when it was unveiled in January.

These shifting relationships appear to have prompted the Jordanian monarchy to circumvent the White House in their bid to prevent annexation and appeal directly to Republican and Democratic US lawmakers. The king held several video calls with congressional leaders, including Nancy Pelosi and Mitch McConnell in mid-June.

Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi has been engaged in a diplomacy marathon, trying to garner international backing for Jordan's campaign to stop the annexation. In mid-June, he paid a rare visit to Ramallah, the seat of the Palestinian Authority's power, in a show of support to Palestinians. He also held a series of calls with his Arab and Western counterparts, including the German, Austrian, Egyptian, Irish and Finnish foreign ministers, asking them to work to stop the annexation.

Jordan's efforts may do little to stave off the Israeli plan, but pressure from another influential Arab state may be having more of an impact on Israeli decision making.

In an unusual move, the United Arab Emirates Ambassador to the US, Yousef Al Otaiba in a Hebrew-language article published in an Israeli daily, called the annexation move ""an illegal seizure."" He gave Israelis an ultimatum: it is either annexation or normalization.

The UAE and other Arab Gulf states have been moving closer towards normalizing ties with Israel. A strategic relationship Israel has been pursuing for years.

""Annexation will certainly and immediately upend Israeli aspirations for improved security, economic and cultural ties with the Arab world and with UAE. With the region's two most capable militaries, common concerns about terrorism and aggression, and a deep and long relationship with the United States, the UAE and Israel could form closer and more effective security cooperation"" Al Otaiba wrote.

The influential diplomat also singled out Jordan and his country's concerns about the impact annexation will have on the Kingdom. Abu Dhabi's Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Zayed reiterated his country's support for Jordan's bid in a tweet last week.

""(The annexation) will send shock waves around the region, especially in Jordan whose stability -- often taken for granted -- benefits the entire region, particularly Israel,"" Al Otaiba warned.",Why West Bank annexation poses an existential threat to Jordan,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/01/middleeast/jordan-west-bank-annexation-israel-intl/index.html,2020-07-01
Tamara Qiblawi,"Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) The United States has rolled out fresh sanctions that aim to drive Syrian President Bashar al-Assad back to a UN-led negotiating table and threaten to devastate Syria's already floundering economy.

On Wednesday the US State Department and Treasury Department released 39 targets for sanctions, including Assad and his wife Asma al-Assad, marking ""the beginning of what will be a sustained campaign of economic and political pressure to deny the Assad regime revenue and support it uses to wage war and commit mass atrocities against the Syrian people,"" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement.

""We anticipate many more sanctions and we will not stop until Assad and his regime stop their needless, brutal war against the Syrian people and the Syrian government agrees to a political solution to the conflict as called for by UNSCR 2254,"" he said, referring to a UN Security Council Resolution calling for a ceasefire and political settlement in Syria.

The first tranche of economic penalties come as part of the newly enforced Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act, which is expected to trigger the most wide-reaching and aggressive economic penalties ever imposed on Syria, potentially targeting its energy, construction and banking sector.

The bill was named after a former photographer for the Syrian military, codenamed Caesar, who leaked a trove of photographs showing dead and mutilated prisoners in Assad's jails.

""Caesar,"" the man credited with smuggling out 50,000 photos said to document Syrian government atrocities, listens to his interpreter as he prepares to speak at a US Congressional briefing in July 2014.

US Ambassador to the United Nations Kelly Craft told the Security Council on Tuesday the move was a bid to ""prevent the Assad regime from securing a military victory, and to steer the regime and its allies back toward Special Envoy (Geir) Pedersen and the UN-led political process.""

Syria angrily hit back at the sanctions on Wednesday, saying the US move ""exceeds the ugliest forms of lies and hypocrisy.""

In a statement to state-run news agency SANA, Syria's Foreign and Expatriates Ministry also questioned US moral authority, in the light of recent widespread protests over the deaths of several black Americans in police custody. The US, it said, ""is the last one who has the right to talk about the human rights, because the US administrations have established their state upon the culture of killing, disregarding any value of laws or conventions,"" it said.

China and Russia also criticized the plan on Tuesday. China's UN Ambassador Zhang Jun called the sanctions ""inhumane."" Russia's UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia accused Washington of attempting to ""overthrow the legitimate authorities of Syria,"" according to Reuters

The Caesar Act, a bipartisan Congress bill, has received broad support from Syria's diaspora community, many of whom were driven into exile by Assad's brutal oppression of largely peaceful protests that began in 2011. Assad has been repeatedly accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity in his military campaign to quash Syria's armed opposition. He is also widely believed to have been behind multiple chemical attacks in rebel-held areas. Assad's government has repeatedly denied the charges.

But even among Syria's opposition, many expect that the US sanctions will also deal a crushing blow to Syria's civilian population. The poverty rate stands at over 80%, according to the UN . Syria's currency collapsed rapidly in recent months on the heels of an economic crisis in neighboring Lebanon, where many Syrian businessmen circumvented international sanctions during the war. Much of Syria lies in ruin.

""(Syria's) economy has become something similar to the economy of the West Bank, an economy reliant on aid,"" Syria analyst and nonresident scholar at the DC-based Middle East Institute Karam Shaar told CNN. ""It's not really a functional economy. It's basically something that survives only because the West keeps injecting money into it.""

US sanctions threaten to cut off injections of cash from donations and remittances that keep the country afloat. Because the Caesar Act includes secondary sanctions -- punishing non-US people and entities for transactions with regime-held Syria -- they will likely create ""phobia"" and ""panic from banks"" around dealing with Syria, said Shaar, choking off financial transactions to the country.

He also warned that humanitarian exemptions for food and medicines included in the Caesar Act may have no effect, a situation that would be similar to Iran, which has also struggled to obtain medicinal supplies despite US waivers.

""When you have an act that destroys the exchange rate of a country -- and you know that 60% of the inputs for the pharmaceutical industry are actually imported -- you are affecting medicines,"" said Shaar. ""The Caesar Act will affect everything.""

""Unless the Syrian regime accepts to negotiate, I project a famine and it's going to be terrible.""

The sanctions' knock-on effects in neighboring Lebanon are also expected to further cripple its collapsing economy. Lebanon's banking sector, which is buckling under a severe liquidity crisis, is believed to possess billions of dollars of Syrian assets. Because of this, the international financial system may soon deem Lebanon's banks untouchable, said Shaar.

Tensions in Lebanon have reached fever pitch in recent weeks, as its currency continued to tank, stoking riots across the country. On Tuesday night, the leader of the Iran-backed militant and political group Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, delivered a fiery televized address vowing to prop up Syria economically and calling on Lebanon to spurn US pressure to abide by the Caesar Act.

Nasrallah also accused the Trump administration of ""laying siege"" to Lebanon's economy in an effort to pressure Hezbollah, and suggested that the country could move deeper into the economic orbit of Iran, Syria and China, doing away with US influence.

Lebanon's political establishment is composed of a hodge-podge of pro-US and pro-Iran politicians. Hezbollah, which intervened in the Syrian war on Assad's behalf, is the most powerful political force in Lebanon.

The US has repeatedly said that it supports reforming Lebanon's deeply sectarian political leadership and combating corruption, and has not yet publicly pre-conditioned economic support for Lebanon on Hezbollah's disarmament. But local media and politicians have speculated that the international community has shunned the country as part of a ramped up international effort to dislodge the armed group.

""(Lebanon's government must) demonstrate that they're willing to take tough decisions to reform,"" said Assistant Secretary for Near Eastern Affairs David Schenker at a talk at the Middle East Institute earlier this month. ""It's hard to see how (Hezbollah) are going to get behind this reform.""

As Assad and his allies double down on anti-US stances, there are few signs the Syrian government intends to return to the negotiating table, and analysts warn that the Caesar Act will do little to hold Assad accountable for his crimes.

""Caesar's proponents hope that the law will prove a step towards accountability for the regime's terrible crimes,"" Syria Program Director at Synaps Group Alex Simon told CNN. ""While that goal is unassailable, there's no evidence to suggest that Caesar would achieve this.""

Simon describes the sanctions as a ""policy of piecemeal, reflexive escalation, for which ordinary Syrians pay the price.""

""People today are selling off what few assets they still have in order to feed their families. Some are selling kidneys,"" said Simon. ""Pharmaceutical shortages are so bad that people have taken to Facebook to pool information on who has spare medicine that may help save lives.""","As the US rolls out new sanctions on Assad, Syria braces for economic devastation",https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/17/middleeast/syria-caesar-act-us-sanctions-economy-intl/index.html,2020-06-17
Tamara Qiblawi,"Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) Anti-government protesters took to the streets in multiple Lebanese urban centers on Thursday, setting up burning barricades and forcing road closures as the country's currency fell rapidly.

Demonstrators hurled stones at military forces and some protesters attempted to scale a security fence outside the prime minister's office in the capital city Beirut. Protesters chanted against the country's political elite, which many hold responsible for the country's economic woes

Lebanon's main coastal highway was closed by burning tires in the north and south of the capital, as protests were staged in areas that rarely see demonstrations, such as Hezbollah strongholds in the capital's southern suburbs.

Protesters chant slogans in the Lebanese capital Beirut's southern suburb late on June 11, 2020.

In the northern city of Tripoli, protesters pelted the army with rocks and threw Molotov cocktails at the city's Central Bank office. Protests also erupted in the southern cities of Saida and Nabatieh.

In recent days, Lebanon's currency has taken a nosedive, losing around 70% of its value since October. The currency's collapse has stirred panic in a country that relies heavily on imports for its basic needs.

Harare (CNN) With her baby strapped on her back, Maud Mufambi clutches a plate as she waits patiently in line for some food.

The 30-year-old mother is among hundreds of people queuing for free food outside a home in Chitungwiza township on the outskirts of Harare in Zimbabwe.

A woman is busy dishing out portions of maize meal porridge and Mufambi and her two-year-old baby are among the grateful diners, who know that, at least for one night, their meal is guaranteed.

Before a friend told her about the kitchen, Mufambi told CNN that her family would oftentimes go to bed hungry.

""My son and I will never go to bed hungry again, this relief kitchen will sustain us as I try to make ends meet,"" Mufambi said with a smile.

Zimbabwe's hunger crisis

The kitchen is run by Samantha Murozoki who is ensuring that people in her community are getting fed in a country where hunger is rampant.

More than seven million people -- half of Zimbabwe's population -- were facing food shortages or hunger before the coronavirus outbreak in the country, according to the World Food Programme (WFP)

UN food agency WFP is appealing for $US19.5 million to fund its logistics and operational response to the Covid-19 outbreak in the southern African nation.

""WFP is currently scaling up its urban assistance program to deliver monthly cash transfers for food to more than half a million urban dwellers in Zimbabwe by the end of the year,"" WFP Communications Director Neville told CNN.

Minister of Labour and Social Welfare, Amon Murwira said the government had revived its social welfare program during the lockdown to cushion millions facing hunger.

""Everyone who lost income can go to social welfare and register for assistance. We have a budget for the next eight months to cater for one million people,"" Murwira told CNN.

In March, the Zimbabwean government imposed the first 21-day lockdown, followed by another two weeks as Covid-19 cases increased.

Zimbabwe has officially recorded just 391 cases of Covid-19 but a mass outbreak would devastate an already weakened health system.

Authorities extended the nationwide lockdown i ndefinitely in May partially opening the manufacturing and mining sectors.

But people like Mufambi, who ekes out a daily living selling imported secondhand clothes, say they're finding it difficult to eat during the lockdown.

She's one of more than 16 million people who are struggling to make ends meet, according to the WFP.

It's a tiny drop in the ocean but Murozoki's food kitchen is plugging the gap and giving hope to hungry families in the area.

Samantha Murozoki serves food to a young child.

A national heroine

What began as a desire to feed a neighbor who had gone to bed hungry at the start of the lockdown has grown into a community feeding scheme, that attracts more than two thousand people daily, according to Murozoki.

""Ever since the lockdown was introduced, a lot of folks have suffered... they are sitting indoors with no way to make money and to find for themselves. This is how my little unit came up,"" she told CNN.

""It was mainly to cater to people I grew up with. Things escalated and I ended up feeding people from all over.""

Children queue for food outside Murozoki's kitchen in Zimbabwe.

Initially, she funded the project out of her own pocket, but the community soon started to contribute to sustain the project -- and she traded some of her own items too.

""It took me less than two weeks to get to 867 people coming to eat... so I started to barter jeans, sneakers, jackets. Anything I wasn't using at the time to trade for maize, cooking oil, salt, labor, so we could get the ball rolling,"" Murozoki said.

The 35-year-old lawyer and mother of two, has since become a national heroine and says her life has changed.

""It's been a roller coaster,"" she says. ""I'm just happy. My son understands that mummy needs to feed people... My day starts at 4 am and ends at 7.30 pm when we served the last meal... It's a lot of work... ""

In May, Murozoki faced a setback after the Chitungwiza municipal police shut down her feeding kitchen over regulatory issues.

She has since resolved the licensing problems and is feeding even more people.

""Our register has about 4300 people that have had a meal once or twice for the past 33 days. We serve an ever-growing community. I am glad that the government has recognized us and the kitchen is likely to feed more people,"" Murozoki said.

'Worst day of my life'

As well as hunger issues, daily wage earners have also been feeling the full force of the law, following a government crackdown on illegal structures.

Bright Mutema, 34, was forced to watch his vending stall destroyed by Harare municipal police. Local authorities have targeted stalls and wooden cabins like Mutema's after the government gave orders for them to be destroyed during the Covid-19 lockdown.

""It is the worst day of my life. I thought I would have somewhere to start from after the lockdown but I'm grounded. I fear for my children. What kind of father will I be if I cannot provide,"" Mutema tells CNN.

""Many people, including myself are more afraid of hunger than the virus. Hunger is more lethal than this virus that we cannot see,"" he said.

Mavis Mapako, 42, a mother of five, shutdown her tuckshop when President Emmerson Mnangagwa declared a nationwide lockdown in May.

Mapako has now resorted to street hawking for a living.

She has endured running battles with police, ordering people to stay indoors.

""I don't have anywhere to sell my goods, vending was banned because of the pandemic. We are always harassed by soldiers and police. All I want is food for my family, I don't even know what to do,"" Mapako tells CNN.

Soaring poverty levels

The lockdown economic woes have also affected the private and public sectors.

Obert Masaraure, leader of the Zimbabwe Rural Teachers Association of Zimbabwe told CNN that government workers were barely surviving under the extended lockdown.

""The lockdown has affected teachers in a big way. Poverty levels have soared. The majority of our civil servants are earning US$30. They have been surviving on side hustles which are part of the informal economy which has been completely shutdown,"" Masaraure said.

""The lockdown has plunged the civil servants into abject poverty,"" he added.

Zimbabwe faces a long road to recovery, former finance minister Tendai Biti told CNN. He said the country would remain stuck in depression until the government addresses Mugabe-era political issues that have made the nation ineligible for international funding.

""The key precondition here is to resolve the political crisis but it doesn't appear that it will be resolved any time soon. So talking about the prospects of a rebound when it comes to Zimbabwe is basically far-fetched and daydreaming,"" Biti said.",She didn't want her neighbors to go hungry during lockdown.

Aisha Salaudeen,"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) Before coronavirus pandemic, Rovingheights , a book distribution business based in two Nigerian cities made sales daily from online and walk-in orders.

The stores were also a hive for book lovers who attended reading events in Lagos, the country's bustling metropolis, and in Abuja, its capital.

But as the virus spread to the country, forcing a lockdown that lasted several weeks in some of its major cities in March, Rovingheights says it was forced to temporarily close down its stores and online operations.

The Roving Height bookstore is also used for small events like book readings

Adedotun Eyinade, co-founder of Roving Heights told CNN that sales dropped significantly during the lockdown, leaving the business with no choice but to cut down on employee salaries in April.

""We weren't making a lot of sales and the logistics of delivering books during the lockdown was difficult because book stores were not among the essential services allowed to operate,"" he said.

""April was difficult. It was like the poorest sales in about two years for us,"" he added.

In Nigeria, small and medium enterprises such as Rovingheights account for 96% of businesses and 84% of jobs, and for the last five years, they have contributed to around half of Nigeria's GDP , according to online publication, Stears Business.

Many sectors in the country such as aviation, leisure, and real estate have been impacted by the spread of coronavirus.

Airlines, for example, are shut down as all airports in the country have been closed to contain the virus.

A free online store for businesses

As businesses like Rovingheights continue to feel the impact of Covid-19, a Lagos and San Francisco-based tech company, Flutterwave , has built a digital store for business owners, allowing them to display and sell their products online.

The company's core business is digital payments and it joined forces last year with Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba's Alipay to offer digital payments between Africa and China.

Founder Olugbenga Agboola told CNN that Flutterwave store was created in response to the current pandemic which has infected more than 115,000 people on the continent as of May 27.

Agboola said the company noticed that many SMEs did not have an online presence which was a critical way of making sales in the wake of the pandemic.

""You have small companies trying to sell to their customers and can't earn due to Covid-19, they are all shut down. So, we thought, what can we do to help them keep the light on? How can we help them move their sales online and settle customers?

Then we came up with the Flutterwave store that allows any small business anywhere in the world to go online, create a profile, and upload their product online and start selling,"" he said.

They can also set prices and choose to integrate their own delivery system or use Flutterwave's delivery partners such as Sendbox in Nigeria and Sendy in Kenya.

""The SME owner has access to analytics on the platform. They can see who is paying them and from where, they can pay suppliers and staff from the platform. It's a one-stop-shop,"" Agboola explained.

Joining the Flutterwave store is free and businesses are only charged a small payment fee for their transactions, he said.

Using the Flutterwave store

More than 1,000 businesses from across Africa have so far signed up to sell their products using the store, according to Agboola.

One of them is Rovingheights . With the lockdown now lifted, the business has partially resumed operations and is in the process of trying to get back on track.

""When the storefront opened, I was like, this is exciting. I felt it was a good way to reach out to more people. So, it's just one of the things we did to get through to more customers,"" owner Eyinade said.

Joining Flutterwave store, despite their own existing online presence, has been a boost for the company, he added.

""One of the highlights of our month was just getting people telling us they saw our store on Flutterwave. We had a lot of feedback like that so that was useful for us,"" he said.

The store, which is open to any type of business on the continent will continue to run post coronavirus, according to Agboola.

“Demand for above-ground pools has more than doubled,” says Steven Metz, president at Central Jersey Pools – a family-owned business founded in the 1950s after Metz’s farmer grandfather realized selling pools would be more profitable than plowing. He attributes the substantial increase in interest to the fact that most Americans aren’t traveling. “People are staying in and enjoying their homes instead.”

While Amazon’s substantial selection of inflatable pools is still an option, Americans are wanting something more substantial to swim in. They’re also wanting something cheaper than inground pools.

Unfortunately, there aren’t enough above-ground pools to go around. Central Jersey Pools will be out of stock until at least early August. And it’s not as though shoppers can just go to a different pool store in the next town over. In early June, The New York Times was already reporting it may be too late to find a pool. Just June 30, an article published by the Omaha World-Herald titled “Supply of above-ground pools is running dry as parents snap up pandemic diversions” spoke to what most of the country is experiencing at their local pool retailer: a severe shortage.

It’s a similar story online. Doughboy Pools, which has been manufacturing above-ground pools since the late 1940s, is telling its customers to expect to wait at least 12 weeks from purchase to delivery. “No one could have predicted the unprecedented demand for above-ground pools,” reads the company’s homepage dedicated to its COVID-19 announcement.

Even shoppers willing to get creative with what they use for above-ground pools right now are running into empty shelves. According to a recent article published by the San Francisco Chronicle, ranch supply stores have run out of livestock tanks – one of the most popular DIY ideas for above-ground pools.

Whether or not you take the livestock tank route, it’s not surprising above-ground pools have a reputation far more Beverly Hillbillies than Beverly Hills. On a $300 budget you can find scores of plastic pools most HOAs would deem eyesores. However, these days it’s not uncommon to find above-ground pools – made of high-quality rust-resistant materials like aluminum and resin – costing more than 10 times that.

According to Recreation Wholesale, a pool retailer in Kansas City, Mo., the average cost of an above-ground pool, including installation, is around $6,000. Still, Recreation Wholesale’s owner Joe Herndon says he’s seeing more customers willing to spend a little extra for what he calls “onground pools.”

Onground pools are basically above-ground pools that can be buried to look like inground pools. Recreation Wholesale’s most popular model is the Stealth pool which costs around $16,000, including installation. That’s about half the average cost of traditional inground pools which start at $35,000 and can go as high as $100,000. In New Jersey, Metz is also noticing more people partially burying above-ground pools. For customers wanting to bury their pools, he recommends Doughboy models, which are more conducive for burial.

One popular alternative to digging up a yard to hide unsightly pool walls is to build a deck around them. It’s even possible to buy these pool-deck combos secondhand. Currently there’s a 28-foot saltwater above-ground pool with a large wraparound deck in South Carolina listed on eBay for $13,000. The original owner paid $24,000 for it 2 years ago.

But perhaps the easiest, and most affordable, way to hide the hardware of an above ground pool is through strategically-located landscaping, rocks and lighting. Still, it’s best not to get so caught up in aesthetics that you buy the wrong pool altogether. According to Metz the biggest mistake people make when it comes to above-ground pools is buying a pool based on looks alone and not getting a thick enough liner. “You want to make sure a liner is durable,” advises Metz. “This is what holds the pool water and the entire structure.”

But even if you end up with the right pool, you can have problems. According to Herndon, the number one mistake people make is buying an above-ground pool online and then not being able to find anyone to install it properly. “Then they typically try it themselves and don’t get it right,” says Herndon. For that reason alone, it pays to buy an above-ground pool from a local dealer.

The tricky part, at least during the pandemic, is finding a store that is open, has the model you want in stock and is staffed with enough employees to help with installation. In other words, you may as well hunt for the Holy Grail. After all, according to Doughboy, “experts are predicting an extraordinary demand” for the next two to three years. In other words, if you envision swimming in your own above-ground pool in summer 2021 or even summer 2022, place your order today.","What to know about getting an above-ground pool, if you’re able to find one this summer",https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/what-to-know-above-ground-pool-summer,2020-07-10
John Branch,"Most are jury-rigging plans to educate online, some entirely. Budgets are in tatters. Students are in limbo. Faculty are torn by the bad options of teaching in person during a pandemic and educating through computer screens. Support workers and others linked to campuses wait, but each day seems to make the view murkier.

Colleges, and the towns that support and rely on them, are microcosms of the nation’s anxiety and uncertainty. They face a grudge match between health and economics. The safest option is to keep campuses closed. That might mean economic devastation to colleges and their communities. Is there middle ground?

Now throw athletics into the caldron. Unlike most professional sports leagues, several of which are already struggling to cocoon themselves in tightly monitored, self-described bubbles without getting people sick, there is no way to separate college sports from college environments or society at large.

Even small outbreaks could spread like wildfires into a forest.

So far, more than 3.1 million Americans have been diagnosed with Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, and 133,000 have died. On Wednesday, the day that the Ivy League canceled fall sports, nearly 60,000 new cases were reported in the United States, a new high.

Some of those were college athletes. Through Wednesday, at least 426 had tested positive for the coronavirus among roughly 50 Division I programs, but the number of cases is likely much higher. About half of American universities either did not respond to requests for testing results from The New York Times, or declined to provide numbers, under the auspices of protecting the privacy of student-athletes.

Ohio State, in suspending its off-season workout programs this week, did not reveal how many students tested positive. It only said that the shutdown impacted seven sports, including football.",College Football Season Teeters on the Brink,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/10/sports/ncaafootball/coronavirus-college-football-season-canceled.html,2020-07-10
Linda Qiu,"Since effectively securing the Democratic nomination in April, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has focused his low-profile campaign on hammering President Trump’s handling of the coronavirus epidemic. We rounded up some inaccurate claims in his recent remarks.

Mr. Biden misleadingly suggested he had recommended specific interventions that would have saved tens of thousands of lives.

What Mr. Biden Said

“There’s a study out of Columbia University and a disease control center up there. They pointed out that if he had listened to me and others and acted just one week earlier to deal with this virus, there’d be 36,000 fewer people dead.”

— in an interview in May on the radio program “The Breakfast Club”

This is misleading. A study by infectious disease modelers at Columbia University did find that about 36,000 deaths could have been prevented through early May had social distancing measures been enacted by March 8, rather than in mid-March. But there is no record of Mr. Biden urging adoption of those measures before March 8, nor does Mr. Trump have the power to compel their nationwide enforcement.

The study estimated the combined effects of all intervention practices including mask wearing, travel restrictions, business and school closings and shelter-in-place orders as “they were varyingly applied and complied with over time on a county-by-county basis,” said Jeffrey Shaman, a professor of environmental health sciences at Columbia University and a co-author of the study.",Fact-Checking Biden on the Coronavirus and His Own Record,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/11/us/politics/fact-checking-biden-on-the-coronavirus-and-his-own-record.html,2020-07-11
Christina Macfarlane,"(CNN) MaliVai Washington is a ""little sad."" That's because he holds a 24-year record that he never expected to possess for so long -- he's the last African-American man to reach a grand slam final.

On July 7, 1996, Washington strode onto Centre Court beside Dutchman Richard Krajicek for the biggest match of his career: the Wimbledon final.

It was the first time two unseeded players had reached this final, which was also disrupted by an infamous streaker appearance just before the coin toss.

The match itself was over in 94 minutes with Krajicek needing only three sets to dismiss his opponent. But the feeling of being there on that day, on the cusp of history, lingers on for Washington.

""It's distressing. It's unfortunate and a little sad,"" Washington told CNN Sport as he reflected on that 24-year record and that it's also 45 years since a Black American last won Wimbledon.

""I'm surprised that we don't have more Americans, period, on the men's side, but also more Black men who are succeeding at a high level.""

Washington makes a forehand return against Todd Martin during their Wimbledon semifinal in July 1996.

'Like catching lightning in a bottle'

He says people underestimate just how difficult it is for a player of any colour to achieve the feat -- especially in the era of Roger Federer, Rafa Nadal and Novak Djokovic, the sport's Big Three.'

""It's like catching lightning in a bottle,"" says Washington. ""The last American man to reach the final of a major was in 2003, Andy Roddick ... I mean, that just shows you how difficult it is not just for people of colour, but for people in general to reach the final of a major.

""A lot of that has to do with, you know, someone named Federer and Nadal and Djokovic over the past 15 years.""

But it also has a lot to do with what he calls ""the numbers game.""

""A young Black boy who's five years old, 10 years old, can turn on the TV Saturday or Sunday during any college football or pro football season, and he can see a ton of players that look a lot like him. Guess what? That's his guy and that's who he wants to be. That's not necessarily the case at all with tennis on the men's side.""

The 51-year-old knows he was lucky. Like so many other professionals in the game, it was his father who introduced him to tennis at the age of five and instilled in him a work ethic so strong that he and three other siblings went on to play professionally.

But the experience of seeing other players that looked like him succeed, also had an impact, notably Frenchman Yannick Yoah, who won the French Open in 1983.

""I loved a guy like Yannick Noah ... I was asked to warm him up at the US Open when I was still a junior. And I thought it was like the coolest thing in the world.

""But I was worried about screwing it up and nervous I'd turned up at the wrong court. A few minutes before 6 p.m. I saw this sea of people coming towards the court.

""You could see his head and these dreadlocks and hear that French accent above the crowd walking towards me. We exchanged a few words; he said, 'I heard you're a promising young player, good luck.' It was a special moment for me.""

As a teenager, Washington was inspired by French tennis star Yannick Yoah.

'They didn't allow Black players at that particular club'

Not all of it was special. Growing up in a sport that was overwhelmingly White, Washington tried not to let the color of his skin dictate what he could achieve on court, though others did.

""I absolutely experienced racism in tennis and out of tennis. There were times growing up you'd play played [a] junior tournament of multiple age groups and you just kind of knew -- or were told -- you weren't going to play at that particular club. They didn't allow Black players at that particular club.""

But the worst examples of racism came through discrimination in the draw.

""You'll see a draw, 32 players let's say, and three of the players are Black ... And there were times where it was just kind of uncanny how two of the Black players faced each other in the first round, and then if you won, you were going to play the third Black person in the second round.

""And you're just thinking ... all right, it could have just been the luck of the draw? But then when it happens a few times it kind of makes you wonder -- OK, are they fixing the draw just to eliminate the Black players from the draw? I would argue that every Black tennis player at some point has seen that.""

Washington has set up a foundation to help bring tennis to underprivileged urban kids.

'Out of line'

As he progressed up the tennis ladder Washington says he was dealt with ""more integrity."" Even so the top level of tennis wasn't immune with a racial slur or joke occurring here and there.

""There were incidences that happened not ever necessarily with the tournament officials, but maybe someone who's working for the tournament ... various comments or jokes that they thought were kind of funny that I was thinking, all right, that's completely out of line,"" says Washington.

The ATP did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment.

Does he wish he would have said something at the time? ""Yes, I do,"" he replies.

""There's a part of me that wishes I had because it could have been an educational moment right there. But there's also a part of me that also says, you know what? I don't want to spend all my time trying to correct what I perceive as a racially-motivated event. That's not the best use of my time.""

So Washington used his time in a very different way. After reaching the final of Wimbledon -- a moment that would prove to be the summit of his career -- he decided to launch the MaliVai Washington Foundation to help bring tennis to underprivileged urban kids. He didn't need to look far to find the right spot.

""You go into this area of Jacksonville (Florida), the 32209 zip code. You go into that area. The last thing you expect to see is tennis. You'll see a group of kids on the court playing tennis, playing competitive tennis and just getting after it.""

Chairman of the Board and President of the USTA Jon Vegosen, MaliVai Washington, Billie Jean King, James Blake, First Lady Michelle Obama, Serena Williams and Katrina Adams participate in the Let's Move! tennis clinic during Day Twelve of the 2011 U.S. Open.

'Challenging economic situations'

In an area notorious for drug-related crime and murder, the Foundation quickly blossomed into a comprehensive after-school youth development program providing tennis, homework tutoring and life skills for low-income youth. As a result, graduation rates are high, teenage pregnancies are non-existent and crime rates low among the students who attend the Foundation.

""Oftentimes, kids are coming from very challenging economic situations,"" Washington explains. ""But that can't ever be their excuse for lack of success or lack of education or incarceration, because the Foundation -- that is your advantage.""

The Foundation's focus on tennis and education is something Washington's predecessor, Arthur Ashe, would approve of.

Ashe was not only the first Black man to win a grand slam -- three in total -- but during his career, he became a powerful activist for Black rights, as well as social and political issues.

Washington recalls sitting next to him at West Side Tennis Club at Forest Hills -- the original home of the US Open.

""I remember telling him that I was I was thinking about turning pro after my sophomore year...and this look kind of came on its his face, like 'I don't know whether you should do that.' But I don't think it was necessarily a reflection on me and my tennis, but more reflection about how much he valued education.""

Arthur Ashe won three grand slams.

At that point neither player would know Washington would go on to reach the final of Wimbledon in 96' -- and win the 'Arthur Ashe Humanitarian Award' in 2009 for his work with the Foundation.

""I think what I what I took from Arthur over the years is, as human beings and certainly as athletes who play on an international level, we have a responsibility to do more than just hit a tennis ball.

""And I'm going to paraphrase here in one of his books, he said: 'If I'm just remembered as a tennis player, I failed. I didn't do I didn't do my job.' That one line has always stuck with me and I've tried to in some ways live by that.""","Wimbledon: 'I absolutely experienced racism in and out of tennis,"" says Mal Washington",https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/09/tennis/mal-washington-wimbledon-final-cmd-spt-intl/index.html,2020-07-09
Matias Grez,"(CNN) It's widely accepted that English football lost a generation of influential Black players in the 1980s and 1990s, who might have become managers but never did.

Fast forward to the 21st century and just five of the current 91 (5.5%) managers and head coaches in England's top four divisions are from a Black, Asian or minority ethnic background.

Both the Premier League and the English Football League have backed players and coaches taking a knee in support of the Black Lives Matter movement in recent weeks, but that lowly statistic leaves both organizations looking more exposed.

Gestures are all well and good, but when push comes to shove, when will black coaches be able to showcase their talents from a position of power?

That lack of representation has now prompted the Premier League and EFL to launch a new scheme to help develop Black, Asian and minority ethnic coaches.

The new initiative -- which the Premier League says is ""aimed at increasing the number of Black, Asian and minority ethnic players moving into full-time coaching roles in the professional game"" -- will give six coaches per season a 23-month work placement at EFL clubs.

Darren Moore, manager of Doncaster Rovers, is one just five black coaches in English professional football.

The scheme will be jointly funded by the Premier League and Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) and the first six people will begin their placements at the start of the 2020-21 season.

On the face of it, the initiative seemed like a positive step; a move towards addressing the huge under representation of Black managers and coaches in the top four divisions of English football.

However, Troy Townsend, the Head of Development at anti-racism organization Kick It Out, admits to being ""a little bit underwhelmed"" by the new initiative and fears yet another generation of black players will be overlooked when it comes to getting jobs in management.

Other critics have labeled the new scheme as nothing more than adult work experience.

""We've been in this space before where we've spoken up about the lack of representation in coaching circles, but I'm not sure what this addresses,"" Townsend told CNN Sport.

'Frustration'

According to research carried out by Farenet in 2014, the proportion of Black, Asian and minority ethnic footballers in English professional football -- in first teams, academies and development squads -- since the early 1990s has been an estimated 30%.

The current figure for professional footballers in the UK is around 25%. However, those numbers have never been reflected in senior positions or positions of authority within the sport.

""There seems to be just an entry level for these coaches,"" adds Townsend of the new initiative. ""Six coaches over 23 months, the best part two years; it strikes a chord to me that will only go so far.

""I'm looking and wondering why it's only acceptable to have six coaches and why we cannot progress something that's rolled out right across the leagues and has a little bit more impact as well, so I'm holding fire on on it.

""There will be some coaches that want to go through that process, no doubt, because maybe they're not in the game. But there must be some who are looking at it and thinking: 'I've had the opportunities at this level and I want to try and pit my wits and find out what the highest level is like.'""

Wolverhampton Wanderers boss Nuno Espirito Santo is currently the only black manager in the Premier League.

Townsend, among others, has also questioned why the new initiative is limited to the 71 EFL teams and doesn't include the Premier League.

England's top tier does have its own program -- the Premier League Elite Coach Apprenticeship Scheme (ECAS) which launched in 2015 -- which it says ""complements"" the new EFL initiative.

Former professional footballer Iffy Onuora, who currently works as the equalities coach for the PFA, admits he ""gets the frustration"" of the scheme's critics but says even the best coaches in English football today had to cut their teeth in the lower leagues.

""If you look at even the foreign coaches, the big headline people like [Pep] Guardiola ... certainly [Jurgen] Klopp, who worked at Mainz, they had a grounding lower down in the Bundesliga [and La Liga],"" he tells CNN.

""Certainly that's where they get their first foot hold; you make your mistakes, you build your reputation and you go from there. So, realistically, for us that's the same thing. You go into an EFL club and you try and pick heads through that.""

The problem of under representation isn't only limited to coaching and managerial positions; it's also a problem in senior business and decision-making roles.

Currently, less than 1% of senior roles involved in the running of football clubs are held by an individual of a Black, Asian or minority ethnic background.

Among the few in English football are Les Ferdinand, who holds the position of Director of Football at Queens Park Rangers (one of the clubs the former England international played for), and Burton Albion chairman Ben Robinson, who has overseen the modest club's improbable rise through the football leagues.

While the new scheme perhaps provides a base to build from, Onuora is aware that it's just one part of large variety of issues around race that English football needs to tackle.

""I think this is a part of increasing the pipeline,"" Onuora says. ""It doesn't take away from the other things we need to do. We need to get black faces in the boardrooms, they are the decision makers at clubs. It's not a conversation in isolation, it's got to be a part of a wider picture.

""You gotta have people in the boardroom, you have to encourage the club and the stakeholders to open the doors, [make] transparent decisions. There's the old saying: 'You can't be what you can't see.'

""If the directors and CEO's can't see other directors or CEO's, or other people around them in their network who are people of color as well, then ... we've got very few Ben Robinson's in the boardroom.""

'Ignorance'

One of the five black managers currently in charge of a Football League club is Darren Moore, who has been at third-tier Doncaster Rovers for just under a year.

Moore is a member of the Premier League's Black Participants' Advisory Group -- which was launched last year to ""ensure the views of Black, Asian and minority ethnic players and coaches are heard"" -- and will be offering his support and expertise to the six participants and the clubs involved in the new scheme.

Like Onuora, Moore says he understands the frustrations people have looking in from the outside, but believes even just the announcement of the scheme is already having a positive effect.

Since it was launched, he says his phone and been ringing with coaches wanting to sign up or asking for more information.

""It's a real start and this scheme gets the individuals hands on,"" Moore tells CNN. ""It's a start; six places better off than we were yesterday or the day before. For me, if the group, if the system works ... then I'm sure more EFL coaches will open up to what we are doing.

""It's six places every season. What if we are sitting a year from now and those six places have gone well, that it doubles or it even triples? That means we started from somewhere.

""So, yes, there is going to frustration. Yes, I have illustrated before it's not the be all and end all in terms of fixing the problem, but it is a scheme that has to be looked at as a positive going forward.""

'Rooney Rule'

At the EFL's general meeting last June, it was announced that the 'Rooney Rule' would be officially introduced after an 18-month trial period.

Named after NFL diversity committee chairman Dan Rooney, it requires clubs to interview at least one Black, Asian and minority ethnic candidate for vacant managerial or senior club operation positions.

However, Townsend believes the lack of data available -- the number of black coaches applying, those who reach the interview stage and are turned down and what the process is like for them -- makes the EFL's 'Rooney Rule' difficult to judge.

Townsend says this lack of information leads to one of the biggest frustrations he faces: people asking him if black coaches are even applying for jobs.

""There's a certain amount of ignorance, not only in this game, but in society in general,"" he says. ""When that question gets asked, I chuckle a little bit and I kind of say to myself: 'Well, I cannot continue to keep answering the same questions over and over and over again.'

""I've been privy to a list of all the black coaches that are qualified, that are able, that could go into the industry; not just in the academy environment and not just in the EFL, and I would hope would be able to cut their teeth at a high level. There are many other people that have been privy to that as well.

""So those noises normally come from people who have no appreciation and understanding of the coaching circles and they'll probably continue to exist, but there are a plethora of coaches out there that could be working in the industry and are struggling.

""And maybe we might lose a generation, again, of those good coaches because they just feel that the opportunities are not there for them.""

While Moore accepts the lack of black coaches is unacceptable, he believes the new scheme a first step towards ensuring this same conversation of under representation isn't being had in the future.

""The numbers are alarming, yes they are, let's not go away from the fact that there are currently five that are serving within the game,"" Moore says. ""What I will say to you now is that there are many, many more from the outside serving.

""We are working extremely hard to bring the rest of those people into the game. As I said before, there are many, many talented [coaches] from the Black and Asian community that are outside the game, that need to be inside the game. Not only that, but I individually know that there's a thirst and a hunger for them to serve the game.

""The wonderful thing that we are trying to do now is create platforms where there is more visibility and there's more opportunities inside the professional game. There's more of a movement globally and in the country to see this change.""",Why English football can't afford another 'lost generation' of Black coaches,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/08/football/black-asian-and-minority-ethnic-coaching-scheme-english-football-premier-league-spt-intl/index.html,2020-07-08
Ben Morse,"(CNN) Global protests sparked by George Floyd's death at the hands of police in Minneapolis are likely never to be forgotten, but less well known are the race riots that flared across the US 110 years ago.

Those riots weren't sparked by police brutality, but by a boxing match.

In 1908, Jack Johnson became the first Black heavyweight boxing champion of the world, fighting at a time when, despite slavery having been abolished 45 years previously, African Americans were still subjected to widespread segregation and racism.

His victory over James J. Jeffries -- in what was billed then as the ""Fight of the Century"" -- on Independence Day in 1910, sent shockwaves through both the Black and White communities across the world

The bout was fought in Reno, Nevada, at the height of the Jim Crow laws era, when racial segregation in the US South was rigorously enforced.

A former undefeated heavyweight champion, Jeffries came out of retirement to ""to make an effort to reclaim the heavyweight championship for the White race."" He added : ""I should step into the ring again and demonstrate that a White man is king of them all.""

Johnson's subsequent victory sparked race riots across the US, pitching a Black community -- jubilant that their champion had won -- against their White counterparts, seething with anger at the outcome of the fight. More than 20 people were killed and hundreds were injured. Most of the victims were Black.

In part due to his refusal to fight Black contenders after beating Jeffries, an extravagant lifestyle and his feud with Joe Louis , Johnson managed to somewhat alienate himself from the Black community and subsequently become something of a forgotten figure.

It wasn't until the rise of Muhammad Ali -- who recognized many similarities between himself and Johnson -- and the arrival of the Black Power era that his career and achievements became more widely appreciated, not just for his sporting prowess but for his trailblazing success in an era when racism was widespread and commonplace.

According to Theresa Runstedtler -- author of 'Jack Johnson, Rebel Sojourner: Boxing in the Shadow of the Global Color Line' -- the boxer's defeat of Jeffries ""ripped the veil off of the niceties that were used to cover up the violence of White supremacy.""

""[Johnson's rise to champion] signified Black possibilities at a moment when all of the regular channels of Black success, whether it be trying to get a quality education or trying to make it in business or even just trying to be involved in politics -- because there was so much widespread disenfranchisement -- this was an example of a success that couldn't be disputed,"" Runstedtler told CNN Sport

""That he had defied social barriers to become the best at something when all of these other barriers were being put up in front of African Americans seeking to improve their social status, symbolically, he was super important.""

Johnson faces Jeffries in the ""Fight of the Century"" in 1910.

Reaching the pinnacle

Perhaps what's even more remarkable about Johnson's success is that he was raised by two former slaves.

""To know that somebody in an era of just the most appalling racism decided as a very young boy that he was going to be something unique and special and then set out to do that is, people talk about the American dream, which is largely a myth, but he embodies it,"" according to Geoffrey C. Ward, author of 'Unforgivable Blackness: The Rise and Fall of Jack Johnson.'

As a Black fighter, he was predominately restricted to facing only Black opponents -- he fought Jeffries' younger brother in 1902 -- competing under the confines of the 'Colored Heavyweight Championship of the World' category which he won in 1903. At the time in some areas of the USA, interracial boxing was banned.

Johnson was the first African American to hold the world heavyweight boxing title when he beat Canadian Tommy Burns in Sydney, Australia.

However, then-current world heavyweight champion Tommy Burns was more open-minded, promising to defend his title against ""all comers, none barred. By this I mean Black, Mexican, Indian or any other nationality without regard to color, size or nativity.""

Burns initially wanted ""to give the White boys a chance"" first -- but Johnson finally got his shot and he took it with both hands.

In 1908, in front of a crowd of 20,000, Johnson was handily beating Burns in Sydney, Australia, before police stopped the fight in the 14th round to prevent Johnson from knocking out his opponent. Nevertheless, Johnson's victory was secure, making him the first-ever Black heavyweight boxing champion.

Given the widespread racial animosity within the American population, largely White media outlets sent out the call for a ""Great White Hope"" to steal the title from Johnson.

After successfully defending his title three times on US soil -- he also drew with Philadelphian Jack O'Brien -- Jeffries, who had since retired to an alfalfa farm, answered the call for a boxer to ""demonstrate the superiority of the White race,"" Ward says.

Jeffries -- who hadn't fought for five years -- said upon accepting the fight: ""I am going into this fight for the sole purpose of proving that a White man is better than a negro.""

James J. Jeffries was once considered one of the greatest heavyweight champions of all time.

'Fight Of The Century'

And so on July 4, 1910, in a bespoke, 22,000 capacity stadium in downtown Reno in front of an entirely White crowd, Jeffries went toe-to-toe with Johnson in what turned out to be as one-sided a heavyweight title clash as you are ever likely to see.

The quicker, more agile Johnson easily evaded Jeffries' lumbering attacks, knocking him down twice. Finally, during the 15th round Jeffries' corner threw in the towel.

""They basically begged [Jeffries] to come out of retirement, pump up his ego and make him think he's gonna win, and he just fails miserably at that,"" Runstedtler said.

Jeffries indicated after the fight his time out of the ring meant he was no longer able to compete with ""The Galveston Giant."" ""I am not a good fighter any longer,"" he said . ""I could not come back. Ask Johnson if he will give me his gloves.""

Johnson before his successful title defense against ''The Great White Hope'' Jeffries.

The result of the fight shocked those in attendance. While Johnson and his team celebrated in the ring, the audience streamed out of the stadium in eerie silence, according to Runstedtler.

Around the US though, the reaction wasn't so muted, with Johnson's victory sparking race riots across many states.

The bout was one of the first fights ever to be filmed, meaning that there was a celluloid record for all to watch. However, just days after the fight, many states and cities banned showings of the Johnson-Jeffries film.

Indeed, two weeks after the fight, former US President Theodore Roosevelt, who himself was a boxing fan, wrote an op-ed in which he supported the banning of moving pictures of boxing matches, hoping that the Johnson-Jeffries bout was ""the last prize fight to take place in the United States.""

From White officials in the US to colonial officials in the British empire , moves were made to prohibit the circulation of the film.

Said Runstedtler, ""[They] were terrified about what this film would do to the delicate balance of power in their spaces where, in particular in the British case, often they were outnumbered by people of African descent.

""There was a huge build-up around it and so it wasn't just the fight itself, and the victory on that day, but the reverberations of it across the rest of the US and the world.""

'A very flamboyant, ostentatious personal presentation'

Outside of the ring, Johnson's lavish lifestyle -- notably his collection of expensive cars -- often alienated him from what people at the time perceived to be a ""respectable"" image of Black leaders of the day, embodied by the term ""Talented Tenth,"" popularized by W.E.B. Du Bois.

""If you've looked at any of the photos of him, he had a very flamboyant, ostentatious personal presentation at a time when African Americans were seen by the rest of society as manual laborers or workers,"" Runstedtler explained.

""He was known to hang out in the vice districts of Chicago and other cities where he traveled and to cavort with the sporting crowd, the gamblers, the pimps, the prostitutes, etc.""

His relationships with Black boxers after he became world heavyweight champion also didn't help. One of his Black challengers at the time, Joe Jeannette said : ""Jack forgot about his old friends after he became champion and drew the color line against his own people.""

Johnson's feud with Joe Louis, world heavyweight champion from 1937 to 1949 and one of the greatest heavyweight boxers of all time, further tarnished his reputation.

Future Black fighters often tried to distance themselves from Johnson as they tried to become ""paragon's of Black middle class respectability,"" according to Runstedtler.

""He bet against [Louis], he hoped Billy Conn would beat him, he hoped Max Schmeling would beat him,"" Ward noted.

""And after the first Schmeling fight in 1936 (which Louis lost), he went down on 120 Fifth Street in Harlem and showed off all the money that he had won betting against Joe Louis and the police had to rescue him from the crowd.""

It wasn't until long after Johnson's death in 1946 that people started to revisit his story and the effect that he had on society, primarily because of the success of Ali and the legendary heavyweight's own interest in Johnson's life.

After going to see ""The Great White Hope"" -- a Broadway show based on Johnson's life, starring James Earl Jones in the lead role -- in 1968, Ali told Jones: ""That's my story. You take out the issue of White women and replace it with the issue of religion. That's my story!""

At that time, Ali's refusal to fight in Vietnam after converting to Islam had resulted in his boxing license being suspended and the government taking hold of his passport. These struggles he faced were the reasons why he saw so many similarities between him and Johnson's plights.

As a result, in subsequent fights, Ali's cornerman, Drew ""Bundini"" Brown, could be heard shouting: ""Ghost in the house! Ghost in the house! Jack Johnson's here! Ghost in the house!"" to encourage Ali.

""People within the Black community, particularly Black men, revisited his image and said: 'Wow, this guy just did whatever the heck he wanted,'"" Runstedtler said. ""And he embodied the kind of powerful Black masculinity that appealed to people during the Black Power era.""

The Black Power movement began in the 1960's in which activists ""boldly challenged the hatred and violence of an intractable system of racism and oppression,"" the author Joyce Marie Bell wrote

Ali's revisiting of Johnson's story helped catapult the one-time world champion -- who had had his title stripped because of his refusal to be drafted into army service to fight in the Vietnam War -- back into the public's consciousness and also create a lineage of great Black heavyweight boxers.

Even Lennox Lewis -- three-time heavyweight world champion -- said that he would ""never forget that I stand on the shoulders of Jack Johnson.""

""To be honest, I knew more about Muhammad Ali,"" Lewis told the Guardian in 2010. ""He was in our time. But I learned about Jack Johnson. Ali's contribution was profound, but Jack Johnson's was the first. It was quite a story. I am a lover of history and it was good to look again at the sort of attitudes that were about back in those days, to see how far we have come.

""Even though Black people were, in some ways, more accepted in American culture, the promoters' dream became to look for controversy. And Jack Johnson was the first great showman.

""He gave them what they wanted. Look at the time he lived. It was remarkable that he was travelling the world, as a Black man, getting arrested, leaving America, going to Europe. In the end he got old, like we all do, and he got knocked out by Jess Willard.""

Johnson became world heavyweight champion in 1908.

The pardon

In 1913, Johnson was convicted for violating the Mann Act for transporting women across state lines for immoral purposes.

Johnson fled to Europe in 1913 while free on appeal. But after years of fights overseas, including the eventual loss of his title in Havana, Cuba, in 1915, Johnson came home where he eventually turned himself over to U.S. authorities at the Mexican border in 1920 and served 10 months in prison.

While the law had found him guilty of transporting Belle Schreiber across state lines, his Mann Act conviction was clearly ""meant as a lesson to the Black folk, the world around.""

Following a long campaign initiated by documentary maker Ken Burns, and with the support of the late Senator John McCain, Mike Tyson, and Lewis among others, on May 24, 2018, 105 years after being convicted of violating the Mann Act, Johnson was posthumously pardoned by US President Donald Trump.

US President Trump holds a signing Executive Grant of Clemency for Johnson in the Oval Office with Deontay Wilder (second left) and Lennox Lewis (far right) in attendance.

And although Trump's pardoning of Johnson ""brought him back into public view,"" Runstedtler contends Johnson's legacy of rebellion against the status quo wasn't fully acknowledged during the pardon campaign.

""(The White campaigners) don't actually want to embrace a more subversive legacy that he has, which I think is actually the more complicated one and the one that I would hope that he would be remembered for.

""Certainly the campaign to pardon him has brought him back into public view for mainstream White America and potentially folks who are boxing fans in other countries around the world. But there's still a kind of underlying or subversive aspect to his legacy, and I don't think has been fully acknowledged in that pardon campaign.""",Jack Johnson: Black boxer who sparked race riots after world heavyweight win,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/03/sport/jack-johnson-fight-of-the-century-110-anniversary-boxing-cmd-spt-intl/index.html,2020-07-03
Matt Majendie,"(CNN) His boss might be famed Mercedes F1 chief Toto Wolff, but Ian James is bringing his own ""passionate"" approach as head of the marque's fledgling Formula E team.

The Briton has been tasked with turning Mercedes , the dominant force of Formula 1, into the front-runner in the electric racing series.

Its appearance in Formula E is down in no uncertain terms to a dramatic and very public U-turn by Wolff, who was an early skeptic of the series.

He even said at the team's unveiling he ""didn't believe that Formula E could make it.""

Now, though, Wolff is a fully fledged convert, and he turned to James to lead Mercedes' venture into electric motor sport.

James shuns comparisons with Wolff, but also aims to copy his boss.

""It's brilliant to work with someone like Toto,"" said James. ""At a race weekend, we speak on multiple occasions. His focus is Formula 1 but he is still very much involved in the Formula E programme.

""What I try to do is the same as Toto, which is holistic. I'm passionate about racing and making sure we're always moving in the right direction. He does that very well.

""He'll leave us to it but he offers great advice when it comes to drivers or analyzing what went wrong at a race and what could have been done better.""

Wolff v Wolff in Formula E

Ian James and Toto Wolff at the Mercedes-Benz EQ Formula E Team launch with the teams' drivers Nyck de Vries and Stoffel Vandoorne.

Despite Wolff's split interest and direction, James is adamant it will have no bearing on Lewis Hamilton or Mercedes' continued ambition to remain No.1 when the F1 season gets under way in Australia next month.

But the Austrian is not the only Wolff James has to deal with. Toto's wife Susie, team principal of the Venturi team , is a partner in using the Mercedes EQ powertrain but also a grid rival.

James laughs at the idea he might be caught in the midst of a Wolff vs. Wolff on-track battle. ""It's certainly a unique position to be in,"" he said. ""But it's great to have Susie on board as she's someone I can have a very open dialogue with.

""We know if we take the right approach and work collaboratively, we can develop both teams faster together. And it would be a dream if all four drivers are fighting for the top spots. Then it gets serious.""

Like Wolff, James' passion for motor sport growing up lay in F1, first getting hooked at the age of five or six.

For him, the standout early moment was spilling onto the circuit at Silverstone when Nigel Mansell won the 1991 British Grand Prix and famously gave rival Ayrton Senna a lift back to the pit lane after he ran out of fuel at the finish.

After studying mechanical engineering at university, James' first job came at McLaren working on the Mercedes Benz SLR McLaren for three and a half years before a switch to Mercedes where he has worked for the last 15 years.

'We're racers'

His roles have been multifarious: part of the team behind the introduction of KERs in 2011 and helping the returning Mercedes to a first victory the following season with Nico Rosberg. But he was also heavily involved in the powertrain development which led to the first world titles in 2014 and the ongoing dominance.

""I'm a jack of all trades, master of none,"" he said. ""I'm an engineer by trade but genuinely a bad one. I've had time in finance and marketing, in program management. It's been a mixed bag.

""And with this, I was lucky -- it was genuinely too good to turn down, not just getting back into motor sport which is a passion of mine but also the opportunity to start up a business.""

And like any motor sport business, the primary goal is winning.

""Internally, there's enough understanding and empathy that expectations are kept in check in our rookie year in a complex series,"" he said. ""But externally we're the team with the three-pointed star, one linked with great success in F1 and DTM before that.

""It takes time, look at F1 for example. But we want to win the competition as we're racers. The mid-term goal is to get into championship contention but we're aware how challenging that will be.

""Of all the things I've done, this will be very hard to top. We're at the start of this journey and making sure we bring the results and build up the business to make sure that it's ready for the future.""",'Toto Wolff of Formula E' aims to make sparks fly for Mercedes,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/11/motorsport/toto-wolff-of-formula-e-spt-intl/index.html,2020-03-11
Emma Reynolds,"(CNN) England rugby union bosses are reviewing the use of the slave-era song ""Swing Low, Sweet Chariot"" as a chant by fans, saying many may not be aware of its ""historical context.""

The Rugby Football Union (RFU) did not immediately respond to CNN but in a statement released to British media the organization said it was determined to ""accelerate change and grow awareness,"" as the Black Lives Matter movement prompts corporations and institutions to rethink how they operate.

In recent weeks following George Floyd's death , a number of British organizations , such as the Bank of England, and businesses have been reviewing their historical associations with slavery.

""The RFU has stated we need to do more to achieve diversity and we are determined to accelerate change and grow awareness,"" the governing body said in a statement.

""The Swing Low, Sweet Chariot song has long been part of the culture of rugby and is sung by many who have no awareness of its origins or its sensitivities.

""We are reviewing its historical context and our role in educating fans to make informed decisions.""

English rugby union fans at the HSBC London Sevens at Twickenham Stadium on June 2, 2018 in London.

Former England rugby union player Maggie Alphonsi spoke out about why she no longer sings the song, writing on Twitter : ""I will NEVER stop using my voice!!""

Brian Moore, a former English rugby union player and commentator said : ""The world has moved on and, rightly, things that were normal then should not necessarily be normal now ... It should be celebrated in its rightful context.""

But former England cricket captain Michael Vaughan posted a news story about the issues around the song on Instagram with the caption: ""Please tell me if I am wrong ... but this surely can't be right !!??""

Is it right for rugby fans to sing a slave-era song?

The song ""Swing Low, Sweet Chariot"" is one of the most recognized African-American spirituals. Revered, emotive, and rooted in the horrors of US slavery and the oppression of race.

But for the last three decades, the familiar melody has also been the adopted anthem of England's rugby union team, its haunting chorus a common echo in stadiums where the national team plays.

And therein lies the problem.

Cornell Brooks, President of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).

Should lyrics which are about suffering and despair be sung by thousands of England fans who are often middle-class, often White?

""A slap in the face to the history of slavery,"" Cornell William Brooks, then president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), described the use of this spiritual in a sporting arena. Brooks is now Hauser Professor of the Practice of Nonprofit Organizations and Professor of the Practice of Public Leadership and Social Justice at the Harvard Kennedy School.

Lord Herman Ouseley, chairman of anti-racism group Kick it Out in 2017, said singing ""Swing Low, Sweet Chariot"" to cheer a rugby team was a matter of ""ignorance, lack of sensitivity and arrogance,' while American academics have called it cultural appropriation

Three years ago, when asked by CNN whether the RFU would be reviewing the use of ""Swing Low, Sweet Chariot,"" an spokesperson for English rugby's governing body said: ""Swing Low has been associated with rugby and rugby clubs for decades. It is sung by fans to get behind the England rugby team.""",English rugby union bosses reviewing slave-era song used as chant,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/19/sport/swing-low-chant-england-rugby-slavery-gbr-spt-intl/index.html,2020-06-19
Frank Pallotta,"""We are in a new normal,"" said D'Amaro, who started the job in May. ""The world is a different place, but we feel really prepared to operate in this new environment.""

D'Amaro spoke with CNN Business on Saturday about reopening as coronavirus cases surge in Florida , the criticisms around opening ""The Most Magical Place on Earth"" in the middle of a pandemic and their recent decision to retheme the racially problematic Splash Mountain.

This interview has been edited and condensed.

Coronavirus cases are surging in Florida, why is Disney World reopening right now? Isn't reopening in this climate unsafe?

We are in a new normal right now, so what's happening outside of the gates of Walt Disney World is our new world. I think you know we were one of the first theme parks to close, and we'll be about the last to open. And we spent every minute of every day thinking about how to operate in this new normal that we're in.

I'm exceptionally proud of this group in terms of what they've put together from a protocol perspective and being able to open in a phased and really responsible way. I had a chance to walk Main Street just a few minutes ago. It feels really good in the park. So yeah, the world is a different place, but we feel really prepared to operate in this new environment that we're in.

What guarantees can you offer to guests that they'll be safe inside of your park?

We've got a screening process, for example. When folks enter the park, they'll be temperature checked. Everyone will be wearing a mask. Sanitizers are basically everywhere in the theme park. We've programmed the environment with six-foot social distancing everywhere that you go, whether that's on an attraction, in the merchandise shop, in the food and beverage [areas.]

The experience will look different. So, you won't necessarily see fireworks anymore, but you still will feel some of that magic that people are accustomed to experiencing at Disney. Our training is really aggressive with our cast members. I had a chance to speak with cast members over the course of the last couple of days. They're incredibly prepared.

What else?

Communication to our guests, who also have a responsibility here, has been really pervasive as well, so they come prepared with their face masks and understanding what social distancing looks like. And then, we're in control of the environment. We have a reservations system that we've put in place that allows us to control how many guests are inside of our parks. And then finally we're doing this in a phased fashion. We will, take our time and with the right way and make sure that guests feel comfortable and that we're feeling comfortable with the operation.

Speaking of guests: Two of the safety requirements for Disney World are wearing masks and proper social distancing. But how are the parks going to make sure that guests are following these guidelines? We've seen many across the country avoid these rules. How do you guys plan on enforcing them?

So first of all, from a communication perspective, we've been incredibly aggressive in communicating to our guests. We've actually had a little bit of fun with that as well, using our intellectual property and The Incredibles, letting the guests know that they have a part in this whole process.

The other thing that we have the benefit of is parks around the world. And we've had a chance to open parks around the world and watch how guests are behaving and shift our operations as necessary. In fact, Disney Springs just opened recently right here in Orlando, and we've had the benefit of working with our guests and our cast members to make sure everybody's doing their part. And they are.

We've been really impressed with guests understanding when they come into this environment that it is a new environment and they have a responsibility as well. And it's working really well. And again, just walking around Walt Disney World this morning, everybody looks fantastic in their face masks, and they all have them on.

But some people may refuse to wear a mask. Some people may take it off and not put it back on. Do you guys have any structures in place to deal with this situation when people break the rules?

We've actually seen incredible cooperation from our guests, first of all. And if anybody loses sight of what's necessary when they're in the park, we have cast members, again, that are exceptionally well-trained. In fact, we have very specific cast member groups, I think we call them ""The Incredi-Crew,"" leveraging the communication that I talked about a little bit earlier. And they'll very nicely remind somebody, ""Pull your face mask up,"" or, ""If you're not eating or drinking, make sure you have your face mask on."" And that seems to be working pretty well.

Did you, at any point since announcing the reopening date, reconsider opening Disney World as cases in Florida spiked?

Listen, we are watching the external environment really carefully. But what we've done here is we've built an operations protocol. We've phased this opening. We put ourselves in complete control. But our confidence has always been high that independent of what's happening on the outside of our gates, we're in a position to open responsibly. And again, it's validated when you go and you talk to our cast members and you see the guests coming in this morning. So, we're really confident with our approach.

If the situation gets worse in Florida, at what point would Disney consider re-closing Disney World?

Well, first, what I'm focused on right now is getting the park open, which I'm really proud of and, again, seeing the guests come in this morning. We built our operation, so we can flex. And so, we'll flex with what's happening on the outside from, again, controlled attendance to training our cast members to kind of watch the motions inside of the park.

Disney has a workforce of about 75,000, which makes it America's largest single site workforce. And many of them may be worried or even scared about returning to work. What do you say to those cast members?

Well, I had the benefit yesterday of walking around both of our parks, and I talked to literally hundreds of cast members, and this is a new environment for our cast. When they come back, they're getting trained in a brand-new way. I think I see the confidence in the cast members' eyes. I hear it in what they're playing back to us.

There's no doubt that at some point people might feel a little bit nervous, but once we train them and help them understand the protocols that we have into place, the way in which they're going to interact with guests, the way that we've programmed the whole operation, their confidence is incredibly high. And this is something I take very seriously. We do have a lot of cast members here. This is our number one priority, to make sure that they feel equipped to do their job in the best way possible.

There's been criticism about Disney reopening in this climate. Do you think that's fair?

I can understand people's criticisms, but again, I am incredibly confident about where we are from an operations perspective. And when guests are ready to come, they can come. It's their choice. We will be ready and open for business and ready to make that magic that we always make.

Disney announced it would be re-theming Splash Mountain into ""The Princess and the Frog"" from the controversial ""Song of the South."" What role did the Black Lives Matter protests and conversations about race in recent weeks have in influencing the timing of the announcement?

We actually have been working on it for well over a year. In fact, I was a part of those conversations over a year ago. Listen, our stories evolve all the time. I mean, back from when Walt started Disneyland back in 1955, he stated that if we would continue to evolve our stories, that they're never ending, that they'll always be contemporary. And I think that that's what you're seeing with Splash Mountain.

I keep using the same word, but I'm really proud of this team and what we're doing on this front. I think Splash Mountain, no doubt, is a sacred attraction to many of our guests. And I think you're going to love what we're doing in making the attraction even more contemporary.",Disney Parks chief on reopening: 'We are in a new normal',https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/11/media/disney-world-reopening-disney-parks-chief/index.html,2020-07-11
Ryan Gaydos,"UFC star Jorge Masvidal on Friday defended Goya Foods as the company’s CEO came under fire for his support of President Trump.

Goya faces threats of a boycott after CEO Robert Unanue praised Trump during an event Thursday at the White House, saying, ""We’re all truly blessed ... to have a leader like President Trump, who is a builder.”

GOYA FOODS CEO WON'T APOLOGIZE IN FACE OF BOYCOTT, BACKLASH FOR PRO-TRUMP REMARKS: 'SUPPRESSION OF SPEECH'

The remarks prompted a backlash on social media led by Hispanics, the firm's customer base, but Masvidal came to the company’s defense.

“Actions of @GoyaFoods speak louder than the #woke mob. My people don’t get influenced by those that don’t know. They’ve been helping our people when we needed it most,” Masvidal tweeted, linking to a story about Goya donating a million pounds of food to those impacted by Hurricane Maria in 2018.

Despite the protests, Unanue said Friday during an appearance on “Fox & Friends” that he wasn’t backing down.

NO LONGER DANA WHITE'S DREAM, UFC'S FIGHT ISLAND IS REAL

“We were part of a commission called the White House Hispanic Prosperity Initiative, and they called on us to be there to see how we could help opportunities within the economic and educational realm for prosperity among Hispanics and among the United States,” he said.

Unanue called the pushback against him “suppression of speech.” He noted that he was also invited to the White House for an event hosted by the Obama administration honoring Hispanic Heritage Month.

“So you’re allowed to talk good or to praise one president, but you’re not allowed to aid in economic and educational prosperity? And you make a positive comment and all of a sudden, it is not acceptable?” Unanue asked.

Sam Dorman,"Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick outlined his state's plans for returning kids to school amid the coronavirus pandemic Saturday, insisting that childen must return to classrooms.

""We want our students back in the classroom,"" he said, calling it ""so important on so many levels.""

Patrick, appearing on ""Cavuto Live,"" promised that resuming classroom education in the fall will be done safely.

""We want to make sure our parents and our teachers come back to a safe environment,"" the Republican said. ""And I think we put that all together, whether it's in mid- to late August or early September The school districts will make those decisions, and I think that's the way it should be.""

Patrick's comments came amid mounting concern over returning students to schools as coronavirus infections reach record highs in a number of states.

While a number of teachers unions oppose the move, the American Academy of Pediatrics has pushed for reopening schools, emphasizing the importance of students being physically present in school.

TRUMP SAYS DEMOCRATS WANT TO KEEP SCHOOLS SHUT 'FOR POLITICAL REASONS'

Patrick said his state will allow districts to address their own unique challenges with the virus by offering flexibility in reopening plans.

""We have set forth guidelines on everything from how schools should operate to their time coming back to school -- but we're giving flexibility to our school districts. Just to put this in persepctive, we have more kids in school, K-12, about 5.5 million, than about half the states have people. We have 1,200 school districts and over 9,000 campuses,"" he said.

""So we like to give flexibility to the local school boards or the local superintendents. ...They have the option to slide that [reopening] back a week or two. We have about 100 counties in our 250, for example, that have less than 20 cases of COVID, so they a may want to go back [at the] regular time.""

GOP REPS INTRODUCE BILL TO HALT SCHOOL'S FEDERAL FUNDING IF NOT OPEN FOR IN-PERSON LEARNING IN THE FALL

The Trump administration has urged states to reopen schools for the benefit of students, parents and the economy.

Confirmed COVID-19 cases in the U.S. hit the 3 million mark this week, with over 130,000 deaths now recorded. The surge has led to new personal protective equipment shortages and long lines at testing sites with delayed results.

On Thursday, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos told ""America's Newsroom"": ""There are no excuses for sowing fear and for making excuses when there are clearly safe ways to do things, and we can make those decisions, take those steps forward to getting schools fully open, fully operational and serve the families that we’ve made the promise to.""

DeVos and President Trump have pushed back on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for reopening schools, which Trump criticized as onerous and ""impractical.""

Democratic leaders have backed the idea of reopening schools but urged caution in doing so.

Julia Musto,"If there's one place on Earth that could get reopening right during the COVID-19 pandemic, it's Disney World, Orange County Mayor Jerry Demings said Saturday.

In an interview on ""Cavuto LIVE,"" Demings told host Neil Cavuto that things in his Florida county are ""looking fairly well here.""

HUNDREDS SEEN LINING UP FOR DOWNTOWN DISNEY REOPENING AS CORONAVIRUS CASES IN CALIFORNIA SPIKE

""I will say that even though the virus is still within our community, we have to learn to live with the virus,"" he said. ""And so, what Disney is doing is really, I call it, akin to a living laugh because this is a wonderful experiment to figure out if we can reopen business and reopen our theme parks and do so in a safe manner.""

Demings pointed out that Disney had been reworking their reopening plan for four months and, if successful, will ""stand as a shining example of what perhaps we can do in other localities around the world.""

Disney World has since introduced new safety protocols, including reduced admission capacity, online tickets, temperature checks, mandatory face coverings for staff and guests over two-years-old, menus on signs, and increased cleaning of high-touch surfaces and high-traffic areas.

However, Saturday's park reopening comes as cases in the Sunshine State are on the rise.

According to the South Florida Sun-Sentinel, total confirmed coronavirus cases in Florida eeked over a quarter million on Saturday, as the state reported an additional 10,383 cases and 95 deaths.

New data released by Florida's Agency of Health Care Administration revealed that almost 85 percent of the state's ICU beds are occupied, with just 933 ICU available beds remaining.

On Friday, there were 63,900 cases recorded nationwide -- a single-day record -- according to the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center.

""Well, I think the difference here is that we're well within our hospital capacity. While we have within Orange County to date a little over 16,000 cases, to put that into perspective with Miami-Dade County here in Florida, they have over 58,000 cases,"" Demings said.

""And, even though we have a significant increase in our cases here locally, what we're not seeing at this point is our hospitals being overwhelmed with individuals who are critically ill. The median age of the persons who are being primarily impacted the greatest by the virus in our community is now around 33 years old,"" he added. ""And, that really is something that shifted since the Memorial Day period of time.""

""So, they have put a number of sanitary protocols in place including mandates about wearing a mask, a number of handwashing stations throughout the park itself, and then enforcing social distancing within the park itself. So, there will be these safety ambassadors located throughout the park,"" Demings said.

Adam Shaw,"The State Department is warning Americans to use “increased caution” in China over what it says is an increased risk of “prolonged interrogations and extended detention” amid increased tensions between Beijing and Washington.

The security alert, sent to citizens in China and obtained by Reuters, warns that “U.S. citizens may be detained without access to U.S. consular services or information about their alleged crime.”

“Security personnel may detain and/or deport U.S. citizens for sending private electronic messages critical of the Chinese government,” the alert said, warning also that Americans could face “prolonged interrogations and extended detention.""

It did not say what prompted the alert. However, it comes amid a deteriorating relationship between the U.S. and China, particularly after the spread of the coronavirus -- which originated in Wuhan -- and its recent incursions on freedoms in Hong Kong with the passage of its national security law.

Additionally, the administration has been ramping up pressure against Beijing over human rights violations about Uyghurs in the Xinjiang region of the country.

The State Department and the Treasury announced sanctions this week against a number of Chinese officials for their alleged role in the persecution of minorities -- including forced abortions, sterilizations and forced labor.

White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters Friday that the actions were one of a number of “strong actions against human rights abuses by the Chinese Communist Party.”

Ryan Gaydos,"Atlanta Dream players came out in support of the Black Lives Matter movement, after co-owner Sen. Kelly Loeffler, R-Ga., criticized the social-justice initiative.

Each Dream player co-signed a statement, which was released Friday night.

SEN. LOEFFLER STANDS BY OPPOSITION TO 'DIVISIVE' BLACK LIVES MATTER AMID ROW WITH WNBA PLAYERS

“Black lives matter,” the statement starts.

“We are the women of the Atlanta Dream. We are women who support a movement. We are strong and we are fearless. We offer a voice to the voiceless. Our team is united in the Movement for Black Lives. It is not extreme to demand change after centuries of inequality. This is not a political statement. This is a statement of humanity.

“Black lives matter.”

The Republican senator sparked an uproar among WNBA players earlier this week when she sent a letter to WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert, asking her to forget about the plans for players to wear warmup jerseys with Black Lives Matter” and “Say Her Name.” Instead, she asked for all uniforms and apparel to have the American flag on it.

SEN. KELLY LOEFFLER, CO-OWNER OF ATLANTA DREAM, OBJECTS TO WNBA'S SOCIAL JUSTICE PLANS

“The truth is, we need less — not more — politics in sports. In a time when polarizing politics is as divisive as ever, sports has the power to be a unifying antidote,” Loeffler wrote. “And now more than ever, we should be united in our goal to remove politics from sports.”

A co-owner of the Dream since 2011, Loeffler said that she wasn’t consulted about the league’s new social justice policy.

Engelbert issued a statement in response to Loeffler in a statement.

“The WNBA is based on the principle of equal and fair treatment of all people and we, along with the teams and players, will continue to use our platforms to vigorously advocate for social justice,"" the commissioner said. ""Sen. Kelly Loeffler has not served as a Governor of the Atlanta Dream since October 2019 and is no longer involved in the day-to-day business of the team.”

The WNBA players union put out a tweet Tuesday saying “E-N-O-U-G-H! O-U-T!” in response.

Loeffler appeared on “The Ingraham Angle” on Wednesday and said she had no plans to step down as a co-owner of the franchise. She pointed out that while sports have the power to unite Americans through their differences, she believes the Black Lives Matter movement is politically “divisive” and “based on Marxist principles.”

She told host Laura Ingraham she had suggested this because the flag is a symbol that has endured the test of time and ""can bring us together.”

Additionally, Loeffler reiterated her stance in an op-ed for the Daily Caller.

“But this is America and I'm not going to bow down to the woke mob,” she wrote. “I'm not going to give up on the team because of my personal or political views.”",Atlanta Dream players show support for Black Lives Matter movement amid criticisms from co-owner Sen.

Julia Musto,"Nebraska's economy has been the least impacted by coronavirus in the country, Republican Gov. Pete Ricketts announced Saturday.

In an interview on ""Cavuto LIVE,"" Ricketts told host Neil Cavuto that the Cornhusker State is ""doing pretty well"" in terms of COVID-19 case numbers and hospitalizations.

NEBRASKA GOVERNOR THREATENS TO WITHHOLD FEDERAL CORONAVIRUS AID TO COUNTIES THAT REQUIRE FACE MASKS

""The thing we’ve really been focused on is hospitalizations, and our hospitalizations are as low as they've been since we've been able to get good data. So, it’s probably going back to as low as we’ve had since the middle of April,"" he said.

""We’ve got about 100 people in the hospital right now who have coronavirus and that's out of 4,000 hospital beds. We've got -- over 40 percent of our hospital beds are available. Over 40 percent of our ICU beds are available and about 80 percent of our ventilators,"" Ricketts continued. ""So, we're in very good shape.""

According to data from the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), the state has confirmed a total number of 20,777 positive cases.

On Friday, health officials reported 154 new cases and two new virus-related deaths, bringing Nebraska's death toll up to 286 people.

""Cases have remained reasonably steady. We had a little bit of [an] increase last week, but…the average of the last seven days [was about] 160 cases,"" said Ricketts. ""So, you can see it really wasn't that much. You know, we’re going to continue to monitor it and continue to make sure that if anybody is infected we get them isolated.""

""But, you know, we’ve struck that balance here so that we've had, you know, been able to manage the hospital systems [and] cases being steady. And, we've got the lowest unemployment rate in the country,"" he added. ""Last week, the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) said our state economy has been the least impacted of all 50 states.""

In its first estimate for the U.S. economy’s second-quarter growth rate, the BEA reported that national GDP is down about five percent.

New York and Nevada saw the biggest GDP decline among states at 8.2 percent and Nebraska saw the smallest decline of 1.3 percent.

""Well, I think all governors are going to be judged with regard to how they handle the virus,"" Ricketts said.

""Here in the United States, we're decentralized. We do rely on our states to be able to take this. And I'm a state’s rights guy so I think that's exactly the right place it should be,"" he noted. "" And, you know, as governors we know our states better than anybody else. So, it should be left to us to manage this.""

David Limbaugh,"New York Times columnist Tom Friedman's proposal that Joe Biden shouldn't debate President Donald Trump unless ""a real-time fact-checking team"" is part of the mix is an ironic illustration of the closed-mindedness of the left.

Why would Friedman want a candidate who is eager to contrast his views with Trump's to impose conditions that would make a debate less likely, unless, of course, Friedman realizes that the failing Biden would be particularly disastrous in a debate?

That seems to be the case here, as Friedman's other condition -- that Trump agree to release his tax returns for 2016 through 2018 -- is just as unrealistic but not for the reason Democrats would have you believe. It's not that they think Trump is concealing some sinister criminality but that the returns would be a gold mine for ginning up class resentment against the mega-wealthy Trump and fodder to smear him with innuendo.

NEW YORK TIMES COLUMNIST URGES BIDEN NOT TO DEBATE TRUMP UNLESS POTUS AGREES TO 'TWO CONDITIONS'

Friedman recommends the fact-checkers be approved by both candidates ""and that 10 minutes before the scheduled conclusion of the debate this team report on any misleading statements, phony numbers or outright lies either candidate had uttered. That way no one in that massive television audience can go away easily misled.""

He arrogantly implies that his candidate -- Biden -- would automatically win in a truth contest. But why should anyone assume the confessed plagiarist and policy chameleon would have an advantage here?

The answer is that Friedman knows, perhaps subconsciously, that any such process would be rigged. Like so many terms in the liberal lexicon, ""fact-checker"" doesn't mean what progressives want you to think it means.

Invariably, fact-checkers are adjuncts of the liberal media who depict opinions as facts, such as a conservative's assertion (or progressive's denial) that we have a crisis on the southern border. At one point, the network-news broadcasts were pregnant with panting anchors apoplectic over the claim and dubbed it an outright lie. As conditions at the border steadily deteriorated to undeniable crisis levels, we heard no retraction from Democrats, much less from the opinion-checkers.

We shouldn't ignore Friedman's ludicrous proposal simply because it will never be adopted, as it provides a window into the progressive mind. Many progressives are frighteningly narrow-minded, intellectually cloistered and authoritarian. They tend to believe their opinions are facts (or so morally superior that they ought to be treated as such) and so are justified in censoring opposing views as inarguably false, immoral, offensive or politically incorrect.

In institutions they dominate, such as academia and Hollywood (or bar associations), they get to define what is offensive and then ban it -- by diktat. For example, Cambridge University rescinded a speaking invitation for psychologist Jordan Peterson because of his skepticism about white privilege and climate change. Compounding foolishness with absurdity, the censors claimed they disinvited him to promote an ""inclusive environment.""

Similarly, some state bar associations now require, as part of the continuing legal education lawyers must imbibe to retain their licenses, a course in diversity, inclusion and anti-bias. Attorneys must sit through the propaganda, during which certain debatable assumptions are treated as fact and the progressive agenda is advanced. One presenter admonished his captive audience to consider the possibility of bias in every aspect of their law practice -- that they should always be mindful of it as they tackle any legal problem, presumably even those that couldn't remotely touch on the subject. How's that for thought control?

One takeaway from these examples and hundreds more is that the left, at its core, lacks confidence that its views could prevail in the marketplace of ideas, and so it manipulates the playing field. We see this in its support for the destruction of monuments and erasing our history because it wants to control not only the current narrative but also the historical one.

Friedman's fearlessness of fact-checkers doesn't mean he's confident that Trump's dishonesty and Biden's truthfulness will be exposed but that today's"" fact-checkers"" will almost always come down on the side of progressives. Progressives are so used to controlling the narrative that they're confident their subjective ideas will be presented as factual. Perhaps even scarier is that they think their opinions are objectively true.

Why must they control people and their thoughts? Why can't they allow people to draw their own lessons from history instead of purging it? Why are they afraid of debate viewers deciding for themselves whether Trump's or Biden's ideas are more compelling and truthful?

How often do conservatives propose that we erase evidence of our history? That we ban certain speech because they find it offensive? Do conservative business owners ever send employees to sensitivity training because their views aren't conservative enough?

Tom Friedman's laughable idea is no laughing matter because he represents the authoritarian progressive mindset. That many such progressives sincerely believe their ideas are superior isn't the problem. The problem is that they want to limit your freedom to oppose them.

Peter Aitken,"The largest Los Angeles teachers union is calling for campuses to remain closed when the new school year starts.

The board of directors and bargaining team for United Teachers Los Angeles say it’s too soon to safely bring children back to classrooms -- despite a push by President Trump to have all schools nationwide reopen in the fall.

In a statement earlier this week, union leaders declared that “safety has to be the priority.”

“We all want to physically open schools and be back with our students, but lives hang in the balance,” UTLA President Cecily Myart-Cruz said. “We need to get this right for our communities.”

Union leaders also cited a research paper that showed a “jarringly disparate rate” of infections and death among blacks and Hispancis, which would put the families of those students at greater risk.

California has seen a surge of new coronavirus cases, with thousands recorded every day. The total number of cases statewide has ballooned to more than 312,000.

The union represents about 32,000 district employees, including teachers, counselors, nurses and librarians, according to the Los Angeles Times. In an informal poll released Friday, 83 percent of union members who responded agreed that Los Angeles Unified School District campuses should not physically reopen this fall.

KUDLOW LAYS OUT 'FOUR THINGS EVERY CITIZEN SHOULD DO' TO ENSURE SCHOOLS, BUSINESSES STAY OPEN

L.A. school officials have already suggested two options for how they would approach reopening: a learning-from-home program; and a hybrid plan that would combine learning at home with part-time attendance on campus in small, social-distanced classes.

""It is hitting us hard to think we may not be back with our students in the fall,"" Myart-Cruz told ABC News. ""And we know this is hard on our students and their parents, so many of whom have stepped up as our partners in teaching while struggling with the economic fallout of this crisis.""

“But safety must come first, along with a commitment to focus on strengthening distance learning.""

The UTLA is still in discussions with the district, but it not the only California union calling for a delay in reopening.

The Oakland Education Association announced that it was in negotiations with the Oakland Unified School District to determine what safe learning will look like in the upcoming school year.

Amna A. Akbar,"The uprisings have also expanded the space for a reckoning with the failures of liberal reforms and with the possibility of doing things in radically different ways. Tinkering and training cannot fix our reliance on police officers to deal with routine social problems through violence and the threat of it.

The demand for defunding calls into question the fundamental premise of policing: that it produces safety. It urges us to take collective responsibility for collective care, repair and redress. It shifts our vantage point on persistent problems: for example, to guarantee housing for all rather than to continue to arrest and cage this country’s more than 567,000 homeless people.

The call to defund the police is often accompanied by a call to shift resources elsewhere, to education, housing and health care. The pandemic has put on display the spectacular contradiction such appeals reveal. We have no guaranteed health care, wages, housing or food; we can’t even provide personal protective equipment. These failures have devastated Black communities in particular.

But then, in response to Black Lives Matter protests, the police show up in high-tech gear and military-style vehicles to arrest, gas and bludgeon protesters, demonstrating where our tax dollars have gone instead. The demand for defunding shifts power and our imaginations away from the police and toward a society rooted in collective care for ordinary people. It brings into sharp relief who we have allowed ourselves to become and offers a vision for who we could be.

Taking money away from the police is not the sole demand. Consider the push to cancel rent. It asks the state to abolish tenants’ obligations to pay their landlords each month. But rent is the product of a private contract about private property: the foundation of our social, economic and political order.

So when organizers make the demand to cancel rent, they are conjuring up a state whose primary allegiance is to people’s needs instead of profit. The demand raises the possibility of a world where housing is an entitlement rather than a commodity. It aims to shift power from landlords to tenants, in the service of visions of housing for all.

Or consider the environment. The Green New Deal does not merely call for less pollution. It requires that we restructure our economy so we can move to clean, renewable energy sources and net-zero greenhouse gas emissions.","'Defund the Police,' 'Cancel Rent': The Left Remakes the World - The New York Times",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/11/opinion/defund-police-cancel-rent.html,2020-07-11
