Stella Chan,"Instagram star flaunted lavish lifestyle but was actually conspiring to launder hundreds of millions of dollars, US prosecutors say","(CNN) A Nigerian man nicknamed ""Ray Hushpuppi"" who flaunted his Rolls Royces, fancy watches and designer clothing on Instagram faces money laundering conspiracy charges in the United States, according to the Department of Justice.

Ramon Olorunwa Abbas appeared in a federal court in Chicago on Friday. He is accused of conspiring to launder hundreds of millions of dollars through cybercrime schemes.

According to a federal affidavit, one of the alleged victims was the client of a New York-based law firm that lost nearly a million dollars in 2019.

Abbas was arrested last month by law enforcement officials in the United Arab Emirates and transferred to the US this week by the FBI.

Prosecutors allege Abbas is one of the leaders of a global network that uses computer intrusions, business email compromise (BEC) schemes and money laundering capers to steal hundreds of millions of dollars.

Nyasha Chingono,"Shooting of Zimbabwe workers by Chinese mine owner shows 'systemic' abuse, watchdog says","Harare, Zimbabwe (CNN) The shooting of two Zimbabwean workers by a Chinese boss shows the ""systematic and widespread"" abuse that locals face in Chinese mining operations, says the Zimbabwe Environmental Law Society (ZELA).

In a court affidavit, police said Zhang Xuen shot an employee five times and wounded another at the mine he runs in Gweru province, in central Zimbabwe, during a row with workers over outstanding pay.

Zhang has been charged with attempted murder, said Zimbabwe police spokesman Paul Nyathi.

According to local media reports , Zhang did not enter a plea because there was no approved interpreter in court. He will remain in custody until at least July 7, the report said.

The shooting happened on Sunday morning, when miner Kenneth Tachiona confronted Zhang after he allegedly refused to pay his wages in US dollars, as agreed, according to the affidavit.

Tachiona charged toward Zhang, who then drew his gun, shooting the worker three times on his right thigh and twice on the left, according to the affidavit.

Police said Zhang fired another shot at workers, and one of the bullets grazed the chin of a member of staff. The wounded workers are being treated at a private hospital.

A video that many alleged to be of the incident has circulated on social media in Zimbabwe, provoking public anger and calls from a local watchdog for a re-evaluation of Chinese mining operations in the country.

Remarks by the Spokesperson of the Chinese Embassy in Zimbabwe pic.twitter.com/cRk0Jc2J46 — Chinese Embassy in Zimbabwe (@ChineseZimbabwe) June 22, 2020

The Chinese Embassy in Zimbabwe described the shooting as an isolated incident and said it was in support of an open and transparent probe by local authorities.

""Any possible illegal acts and persons who violate the law should not be shielded. China and Zimbabwe have a long-standing friendship and cooperation. We call upon all relevant sides to safeguard it jealousy and carefully,"" the Chinese Embassy said in a statement on Twitter.

The Chinese Foreign Ministry told CNN: ""Overall, Chinese companies in Zimbabwe have operated their businesses in accordance with local laws and regulations, and made positive contributions to Zimbabwe's economic and social development.

""We respect Zimbabwe's handling of the case in accordance with law, but at the same time hope to see Zimbabwe protect the safety as well as legitimate rights and interests of Chinese nationals. There is traditional friendship between the two countries and we believe both sides will be able to properly handle this case.""

Dangerous conditions

China is Zimbabwe's largest foreign investor with significant interests in the country's extractive sector.

Last year, Chinese firm Tsignchan signed a $2 billion deal with the Zimbabwean Ministry of Mines to extract chrome, iron ore, nickel and coal, vital resources for China.

At least 10,000 Chinese people are in Zimbabwe, and many are working on in the country's mining, telecoms, and construction sectors on a contractual basis, according to a 2016 Brookings Institution report

But their presence in the country has sometimes been controversial.

Both Chinese-run mines in the country and state mining operations have been dogged with allegations of human rights violations and poor safety measures for staff.

In February, a group of local miners in Matabeleland South province petitioned a labor court to protest their firing by their Chinese employer.

Last April, workers at another Chinese mining operation in the province complained of being underpaid and working without protective clothing.

Several cases of Chinese miners refusing to pay salaries or provide their workers with protective clothing, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic, are currently being investigated by ZELA, according to its deputy director Shamiso Mutisi

""It has become a pattern and a system. We have cases where miners are abused, beaten, and discriminated against by Chinese miners,"" Mutisi said.

In a statement on Wednesday, ZELA said locals in some Chinese-owned mines often operate ""dangerous, harsh, and life-threatening"" conditions, while being paid poorly for their time.

Sunday's shooting is another reason for the government to rethink its political and economic engagements with China, the group said.

""In many parts of Africa, including Zimbabwe, Chinese mining investors have exhibited a history of bad safety, health, environmental, labor, and human rights standards,"" the statement said.

CNN has contacted China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs for comment.

The Chinese community in Gweru has distanced itself from the recent incident and promised to pay for injured workers' medical bills and support their families as they deal with the issue.

The Chinese community said in a statement the incident does not reflect the behavior of its members, and they have engaged the company to compensate the workers.

""We sincerely hope that our friendship and cooperation between the two countries and two peoples will not be sullied by this isolated incident, which does not reflect the behavior of us all as the Chinese community,"" the statement read.",2020-06-27,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/27/africa/zimbabwe-mine-shooting-intl/index.html
Bukola Adebayo,She's on the frontline of a rape epidemic. The pandemic has made her work more dangerous,"CNN is committed to covering gender inequality wherever it occurs in the world. This story is part of As Equals, an ongoing series.

Lagos, Nigeria -- At the start of each day, Dr. Anita Kemi DaSilva-Ibru and her team put on gloves, facemasks and other personal protective equipment to see their patients.

They're not treating people for Covid-19, but they are on the frontline of the pandemic, working at the Women at Risk International Foundation (WARIF), a rape crisis center in Lagos, Nigeria.

Wearing protective gear is the new reality for crisis center workers, like DaSilva-Ibru.

""We change these kits each time we see a survivor as we are mindful of the risk of transmission of the virus between the survivor and us and the cross-contamination between a survivor and the next,"" she told CNN.

US-trained gynecologist DaSilva-Ibru has spent most of her career treating hundreds of sexual violence victims but it was the growing scale of the crisis in Nigeria that prompted her to set up WARIF in 2016.

The clinic in Yaba, a suburb of Lagos, provides medical treatment, legal assistance therapy and space for rape victims and survivors of sexual abuse to get back on their feet.

One in four Nigerian girls has been the victim of sexual violence, according to UN estimates but DaSilva-Ibru says the numbers are higher as many cases go unreported due to the stigma attached.

In recent weeks, two high profile cases of gender-based violence have brought Nigerian women out onto the streets demanding change.

Uwaila Vera Omozuwa, a 22-year-old microbiology student, was found half-naked in a pool of blood in a local church where she had gone to study after the Covid-19 lockdown left universities across the country shut.

""Rape is an epidemic in this country."" Dr. Anita Kemi DaSilva-Ibru, Women at Risk International Foundation

Her family said her attackers raped her and the student died while being treated at the hospital. A few days later, another student, Barakat Bello, was allegedly raped and killed during a robbery at her home, according to human rights group Amnesty International.

""Rape is an epidemic in this country,"" DaSilva-Ibru told CNN.

She says her work with survivors of sexual violence has become more critical during the outbreak, with restrictions to curb the virus from spreading fueling a surge in calls.

It's a story echoed in other parts of the region, as authorities grapple with a growing number of Covid-19 cases and the impact restrictions are having on women.

DaSilva-Ibru said she initially closed the center after authorities locked down the city in March, she had to reconsider the decision as the organization became inundated with SOS messages from sexual violence victims and their guardians.

Staff operating the 24-hour helpline at the center also reported a 64% increase in calls during this period, according to DaSilva-Ibru.

""Our phones were ringing. Women were calling and desperately asking how we can help them, these were women in fear of their lives, as many have now been forced into quarantine with their abusers, in an already volatile environment,"" DaSilva-Ibru told CNN.

For the center to re-open, DaSilva-Ibru said she had to source PPE, face masks and other protective gear personally and when that was not enough, the center launched an online appeal for funds from donors to buy the equipment at no cost to survivors, she said.

""We carry out forensic examinations on survivors and our frontline health workers who triage and examine patients are in close proximity to the survivors. As much as we need to carry out our duties, we also need to ensure our workers are adequately protected,"" DaSilva-Ibru told CNN.

The challenges Ibru faces to keep the center open, doesn't compare to what sexual violence victims have experienced as a result of this pandemic, she said.

DaSilva-Ibru recalls a woman who told staff at the center that her male friend had raped her in her home during the lockdown.

Dr. Anita Kemi DaSilva-Ibru.

""The first day we re-opened, we attended to women who had walked many miles in spite of the mandatory lockdown to get to the center. These are women who had been terrorized in their homes,"" she added.

""She (a survivor) had repeatedly been calling (the center) to find out how she could get help. She feared she might have contracted HIV and wanted to be tested,"" Ibru said.

Speaking to CNN, the woman, who didn't want to use her name to protect her identity, said a co-worker raped her after he came to her apartment unannounced in April.

The young banker said she had previously rebuffed his attempts to visit, but on that Sunday afternoon in April, he showed up at her doorstep.

""He's a friend, not a stranger, so I opened the door for him. I was still asking him what was so urgent that made him leave his home. He said he wanted to check up on me and I told him he could have done that over the phone,"" she told CNN.

But a few minutes into his visit, the conversation became uncomfortable between them.

""He kept coming towards me, and when I told him to stop, he put his hand over my mouth and pinned me on the floor,"" she said.

She says he apologized after raping her and hurriedly left her house.

The survivor told CNN she did not make a police complaint because she was worried about the stigma and strain that the rape might have on her parents.

A friend she confided in told her to reach out to the Lagos Domestic and Sexual Violence Response Team who put survivors in touch with treatment centers for help.

After several calls to the centers on their website, she was referred to WARIF

When she went to the clinic, she says staff ran some tests and placed her on Post Exposure Prophylaxis, a HIV prevention treatment for possible exposure.

""Sometimes I get really angry, and sometimes I feel numb,"" she said, reflecting on the assault.

She says she was sick every night for 28 days because of the drugs.

""...even though the doctor prepared me for the side effect, it has not been easy,"" she told CNN.

Gender-based violence is a problem in many countries, but the coronavirus pandemic has worsened the situation.

The UN says the raft of measures deployed by governments to fight the pandemic have led to economic hardship, stress, and fear -- conditions that lead to violence against women and girls.

Equality Now Regional Coordinator in Africa Judy Gitau told CNN that the wave of unemployment and school closures has put victims in a precarious situation.

The government enforced strict stay-at-home orders that closed businesses and schools across the West African nation to curb the spread of the virus, she said.

The restrictions made schoolgirls vulnerable to abuse as some were assaulted in their homes by relatives, and at the same time, a majority of girls from low-income families were coerced to exchange sex for money for food, Gitau said.

""Many of them wound up pregnant but the evidence became available when people were plugging back to life as they knew it as a normal society,"" she said.

Gitau says authorities must know that perpetrators often take advantage of the strict measures to abuse victims without arousing much suspicion.

As state resources are being re-focused to tackle the spread of coronavirus, law enforcement agencies should also respond quickly to reports of abuse and create shelters for victims in need of immediate rescue, she said.

But placing women in shelters, especially in countries battling an outbreak, comes with the additional burden of proof, according to DaSilva-Ibru who said shelters in Lagos city are asking survivors to take coronavirus tests before they can be admitted to prevent infection in their facilities.

""Violence against women and girls is one of the most pervasive forms of a human rights violation and should be recognized by all countries."" Dr. Anita Kemi DaSilva-Ibru, Women at Risk International Foundation

Authorities in Lagos designated gender-based violence services essential in May as it eased lockdown into curfews to allow service providers to get to work more smoothly, DaSilva-Ibru said.

The police force says it has now deployed more officers to its stations across the country to respond to the ""increasing challenges of sexual assaults and domestic/gender-based violence linked with the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic."" And last week, governors across the country resolved to declare a state of emergency on rape , according to the Nigerian Governor's Forum (NGF).

It's the first time federal and state authorities are coming out with a united voice to condemn gender violence, DaSilva-Ibru said and it validates the outcry of women in the country and the scale of the problem in Nigeria, she added.

""Violence against women and girls is one of the most pervasive forms of a human rights violation and should be recognized by all countries,"" DaSilva-Ibru said.

""In Nigeria, it has become a national crisis that needs urgent attention. I am pleased that this has been recognized.""",2020-06-23,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/23/africa/asequals-nigeria-rape-sexual-violence-intl/index.html
Kieron Monks,Nigeria challenges Christie's over 'looted' treasures,"Written by Kieron Monks, CNN

Nigerian historians and government officials are trying to stop the auction of several artifacts from the country.

The artifacts featured in auction house Christie's collection "" Arts of Africa, Oceania and North America "" are scheduled to go under the hammer in Paris Monday, with the most valuable expected to raise up to $1 million.

Critics claim the collection includes artworks that were looted during Nigeria's civil war, as well as other pieces that were taken earlier under British colonial rule.

Christie's deny that any items in the sale were acquired illegitimately.

Divine sculptures

Controversy has centered around Lot 47 -- a pair of sculptures representing Alusi, deities of the Igbo people, one of the three largest ethnic groups in Nigeria.

The sculptures are expected to raise more than $280,000.

The auction house lists the provenance of the sculptures as the collection of Jacques Kerchache, a leading collector of African art, adviser to the late President of France Jacques Chirac, and an influential figure in the creation of the Quai Branly museum in Paris.

The pieces passed to another private collection after Kerchache's death in 2001.

But Igbo-Nigerian art historian Chika Okeke-Agulu of Princeton University alleges the pieces were looted during civil war between 1967-70 , when the majority-Igbo region of Biafra seceded from Nigeria, precipitating a bloody conflict with the national government in which an estimated one to three million people died.

""My mother still mourns the overnight disappearance of countless alusi from communal shrines in my hometown, Umuoji, in Anambra State,"" wrote Okeke-Agulu in an Instagram post on June 6, that concluded ""these artworks are stained with the blood of Biafra's children.""

According to Christie's, Kerchache would have received the pieces in either Cameroon or Paris via local dealers.

""It is our understanding Mr. Kerchache never went to Nigeria in 1968/69 which suggests local agents were involved in initial trading, likely to Cameroon before shipment to Europe,"" said a source inside Christie's with knowledge of the artifacts in question.

""We have not had provided any additional information or documentation from any parties that questions the legality or legitimacy of the sale of these objects.""

The Christie's source added that any evidence the artifacts were ""acquired improperly"" would be assessed.

Proof of origin

The Nigerian government is demanding proof of the sculptures' origins, and of several other pieces listed in the sale.

""Some of the items ought not to be auctioned,"" says Babatunde Adebiyi, legal adviser of the National Commission for Museums and Monuments (NCMM), a Nigerian government agency. ""We suspect that some were taken out of Nigeria against the UNESCO convention of 1954 on antiquities taken from conflicts.""

The NCMM sent a letter to Christie's on June 17, seen by CNN, asking the company to remove the sculptures and four other lots from the auction while the agency verifies their provenance.

The cited lots include a bronze plaque from the Kingdom of Benin that the NCMM says was among the Benin Bronzes looted by the British army in 1897. The provenance is listed as 20th century Austrian art collector Frederick Wolff-Knize.

Adebiyi says the NCMM did not receive a reply to their letter. A representative of Christie's Paris branch disputes this, claiming ""we received this correspondence and replied to try to address these concerns, and to assure that these objects are being lawfully sold.""

Mounting criticism

Professor Okeke-Agulu is dismissive of the auctioneer's claim that the sculptures were procured ethically.

""I wonder what (Christie's) so-called well-respected scholars, collectors and dealers showed them as proof that these objects were legally acquired from a war zone,"" he told CNN.

""They can twist themselves into all kinds of difficult positions to try to justify the simple fact that they are selling sacred objects that were expropriated from my homeland.""

Nigerian-American art historian Sylvester Okwunodu Ogbechie of the University of California Santa Barbara has also criticized the auction.

""Christie's is putting up for sale African artworks that are clearly major items in the restitution debate,"" he wrote in a blog post . ""These activities are clearly meant to undermine the ongoing discussions about returning such African artworks to their countries of origin.""

The issue has also attracted wider public interest with more than 2,000 people signing a petition titled ""Stop Christie's from selling STOLEN Igbo Sculptures. #BlackArtsMatter.""

Amicable resolution?

The status of artifacts from African countries in European museums and auction houses has been under renewed scrutiny in recent months, as some Black Lives Matter protesters have made restitution a priority issue.

Earlier this month, BLM activists attempted to seize an African artwork at the Quai Branly museum in Paris, arguing it should be returned to its country of origin. The protesters were stopped and arrested.

The Nigerian government favors a consensual approach over direct action or litigation, says Adebiyi, citing the Benin Dialogue Group - a forum between Nigerian stakeholders and US and European museums over the Benin Bronzes.

""We have tried mediation...we don't want to spoil anyone's business,"" he says. ""But we cannot allow Nigerian artifacts to be sold abroad as they mean so much to us.""

For its part, Christie's has indicated a willingness to discuss the wider issues.

""We acknowledge there are nuanced and complex debates around cultural property and history,"" the Christie's source said. ""We wish to work in partnership with all stakeholders and where there is an opportunity, work diligently to find the right solutions for works of art.""

As of now Monday's auction is scheduled to go ahead as planned.",2020-07-14,https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/christies-nigeria-artifacts/index.html
Nyasha Chingono,She didn't want her neighbors to go hungry during lockdown. Now she is feeding thousands daily,""" Covid Heroes and Newsmakers "" is a weekly social media series featuring live interviews with African heroes serving their communities and newsmakers driving strategy as the continent faces Covid-19. Watch every Wednesday on CNN Africa Instagram .

Harare (CNN) With her baby strapped on her back, Maud Mufambi clutches a plate as she waits patiently in line for some food.

The 30-year-old mother is among hundreds of people queuing for free food outside a home in Chitungwiza township on the outskirts of Harare in Zimbabwe.

A woman is busy dishing out portions of maize meal porridge and Mufambi and her two-year-old baby are among the grateful diners, who know that, at least for one night, their meal is guaranteed.

Before a friend told her about the kitchen, Mufambi told CNN that her family would oftentimes go to bed hungry.

""My son and I will never go to bed hungry again, this relief kitchen will sustain us as I try to make ends meet,"" Mufambi said with a smile.

Zimbabwe's hunger crisis

The kitchen is run by Samantha Murozoki who is ensuring that people in her community are getting fed in a country where hunger is rampant.

More than seven million people -- half of Zimbabwe's population -- were facing food shortages or hunger before the coronavirus outbreak in the country, according to the World Food Programme (WFP)

UN food agency WFP is appealing for $US19.5 million to fund its logistics and operational response to the Covid-19 outbreak in the southern African nation.

""WFP is currently scaling up its urban assistance program to deliver monthly cash transfers for food to more than half a million urban dwellers in Zimbabwe by the end of the year,"" WFP Communications Director Neville told CNN.

Minister of Labour and Social Welfare, Amon Murwira said the government had revived its social welfare program during the lockdown to cushion millions facing hunger.

""Everyone who lost income can go to social welfare and register for assistance. We have a budget for the next eight months to cater for one million people,"" Murwira told CNN.

In March, the Zimbabwean government imposed the first 21-day lockdown, followed by another two weeks as Covid-19 cases increased.

Zimbabwe has officially recorded just 391 cases of Covid-19 but a mass outbreak would devastate an already weakened health system.

Authorities extended the nationwide lockdown i ndefinitely in May partially opening the manufacturing and mining sectors.

But people like Mufambi, who ekes out a daily living selling imported secondhand clothes, say they're finding it difficult to eat during the lockdown.

She's one of more than 16 million people who are struggling to make ends meet, according to the WFP.

It's a tiny drop in the ocean but Murozoki's food kitchen is plugging the gap and giving hope to hungry families in the area.

Samantha Murozoki serves food to a young child.

A national heroine

What began as a desire to feed a neighbor who had gone to bed hungry at the start of the lockdown has grown into a community feeding scheme, that attracts more than two thousand people daily, according to Murozoki.

""Ever since the lockdown was introduced, a lot of folks have suffered... they are sitting indoors with no way to make money and to find for themselves. This is how my little unit came up,"" she told CNN.

""It was mainly to cater to people I grew up with. Things escalated and I ended up feeding people from all over.""

Children queue for food outside Murozoki's kitchen in Zimbabwe.

Initially, she funded the project out of her own pocket, but the community soon started to contribute to sustain the project -- and she traded some of her own items too.

""It took me less than two weeks to get to 867 people coming to eat... so I started to barter jeans, sneakers, jackets. Anything I wasn't using at the time to trade for maize, cooking oil, salt, labor, so we could get the ball rolling,"" Murozoki said.

The 35-year-old lawyer and mother of two, has since become a national heroine and says her life has changed.

""It's been a roller coaster,"" she says. ""I'm just happy. My son understands that mummy needs to feed people... My day starts at 4 am and ends at 7.30 pm when we served the last meal... It's a lot of work... ""

In May, Murozoki faced a setback after the Chitungwiza municipal police shut down her feeding kitchen over regulatory issues.

She has since resolved the licensing problems and is feeding even more people.

""Our register has about 4300 people that have had a meal once or twice for the past 33 days. We serve an ever-growing community. I am glad that the government has recognized us and the kitchen is likely to feed more people,"" Murozoki said.

'Worst day of my life'

As well as hunger issues, daily wage earners have also been feeling the full force of the law, following a government crackdown on illegal structures.

Bright Mutema, 34, was forced to watch his vending stall destroyed by Harare municipal police. Local authorities have targeted stalls and wooden cabins like Mutema's after the government gave orders for them to be destroyed during the Covid-19 lockdown.

""It is the worst day of my life. I thought I would have somewhere to start from after the lockdown but I'm grounded. I fear for my children. What kind of father will I be if I cannot provide,"" Mutema tells CNN.

""Many people, including myself are more afraid of hunger than the virus. Hunger is more lethal than this virus that we cannot see,"" he said.

Mavis Mapako, 42, a mother of five, shutdown her tuckshop when President Emmerson Mnangagwa declared a nationwide lockdown in May.

Mapako has now resorted to street hawking for a living.

She has endured running battles with police, ordering people to stay indoors.

""I don't have anywhere to sell my goods, vending was banned because of the pandemic. We are always harassed by soldiers and police. All I want is food for my family, I don't even know what to do,"" Mapako tells CNN.

Soaring poverty levels

The lockdown economic woes have also affected the private and public sectors.

Obert Masaraure, leader of the Zimbabwe Rural Teachers Association of Zimbabwe told CNN that government workers were barely surviving under the extended lockdown.

""The lockdown has affected teachers in a big way. Poverty levels have soared. The majority of our civil servants are earning US$30. They have been surviving on side hustles which are part of the informal economy which has been completely shutdown,"" Masaraure said.

""The lockdown has plunged the civil servants into abject poverty,"" he added.

Zimbabwe faces a long road to recovery, former finance minister Tendai Biti told CNN. He said the country would remain stuck in depression until the government addresses Mugabe-era political issues that have made the nation ineligible for international funding.

""The key precondition here is to resolve the political crisis but it doesn't appear that it will be resolved any time soon. So talking about the prospects of a rebound when it comes to Zimbabwe is basically far-fetched and daydreaming,"" Biti said.",2020-06-18,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/18/africa/zimbabwe-coronavirus-lockdown-intl/index.html
Jo Munnik,Cape Town unfiltered: These photographers are shedding new light on the city,"Cape Town, South Africa (CNN) — When you think of Cape Town, what do you imagine? Perhaps you picture Table Mountain, penguins on the sand, or the stunning beaches that surround this city.

Cape Town is often considered one of the most Instagrammable cities in the world. For the past seven years, it has been voted the top tourist city in the world by the Telegraph Travel Awards

But beyond the picture-perfect version of the city, a different, more complex reality exists -- set against the backdrop of the world's most unequal country

Here we meet two of the photographers working to revealing a deeper, grittier and less publicized side of the city through their images.

l e v a r t

Ismaiel Isaacs, the portrait photographer of the Cape Flats

Ismaiel Isaacs , 31, grew up in Manenberg, in the Cape Flats -- a flat, sandy urban sprawl on the outskirts of Cape Town's city center. Beginning in the early 1950s, under South Africa's apartheid government, people of color were forcibly relocated there earning it the reputation of "" apartheid's dumping ground .""

Today, it is home to over a million people , most of whom are of mixed heritage.

Even after 26 years of democracy, it remains a notorious part of Cape Town, socio-economically marginalized from the city center and surrounding suburbs.

As Isaacs tells CNN, living here is a struggle; on a daily basis, people face gang violence , poverty and the risk of death due to ongoing drug wars.

But it is also a place of great character, community and culture -- and that is where Isaacs draws his inspiration.

""I try and convey a message of the beauty that's in the struggle,"" Issacs says. ""[It's] not only the struggles that we go through that make us stronger people, but people that live here -- they are beautiful.""

His photographs focus mostly on portraits of people from these communities. He describes his aesthetic as raw, unfiltered and emotive.

""My story of Cape Town in my photography is the story of not just mountains and beaches, but there's also an unpolished side of Cape Town that has been forgotten about,"" he says. ""And I feel that there's a need for us to recognize it, because there's a lot happening here. And actually, in the Cape Flats, we need support.""

Isaacs also says that he uplifts people through taking their photos.

""I'm trying to take the negatives and bring it into a positive, because as soon as I pick up my camera and ask someone, 'Look, here, can I take a picture of you?' What are they going to do? They're going to smile,"" he says.

""For that moment, I'm making them smile and that's fulfilling enough for me.""

Barry Christianson, the documentary photographer

Barry Christianson , 38, grew up straddling two different worlds: during the week, he lived with his mom in the Cape Flats, while his weekends were spent with his dad in the middle-class suburbs of Cape Town.

""Cape Town is a fundamentally fractured city, as divided as it is beautiful,"" Christianson says. ""There are multiple cities existing side by side -- some for the haves and others for the have-nots.""

For as long as he can remember, social and geographic disparity have impacted the way he has viewed the city he calls home. After spending 16 years as a computer programmer, he felt compelled to turn his photography hobby into a full-time job.

Barry Christianson, documentary photographer Courtesy Barry Christianson

""From colonialism through apartheid to democracy, people of color have been dispossessed of land, livelihood and freedom of movement,"" Christianson says.

""Having to navigate the two realities and all that came along with them made me acutely aware of spaces I inhabited,"" he explains. ""A lot of my photography deals with issues around space and how space is created, who's in the space, who creates it and what happens to the space when different people occupy it.""

He brought CNN along for a tour of locations he's captured that illustrate these themes -- like Saunders' Rocks, a former Whites-only beach. Today, Christianson believes it is one of the most racially integrated beaches in the city.

He took one of his favorite photos at this spot -- a Muslim woman wearing a burkini, something he says you might not see in other parts of the city.

A lot of his work also focuses on people who have faced more recent eviction, especially in areas of inner-city gentrification

""As developers buy and sell valuable properties in the city center, black and mixed-race South Africans who managed to stay in the inner city throughout the apartheid era are being evicted and forced into low-quality housing on the city's outskirts"", Christianson says

""[Cape Town is a] city that keeps moving people around , a very specific group of people around, who are never really allowed to stay in one place permanently,"" he added.

Michael Cross,Namibia's last wild horses face a perilous future,"(CNN) — It's still debated exactly how the Namibian desert became home to a herd of wild horses.

One theory is that diamond prospectors brought horses more than a century ago to since-abandoned mining fields. Another theory, says author and historian Manni Goldbeck, is that they arrived with South African soldiers, who in 1915 landed in Luderitz, a town to the south. Later the troops were bombed, Goldbeck says, scattering the horses into the Namib coastal desert, where they remained.

In any case, this has been their home for over a century, and what isn't up for debate is that they're desperately imperiled.

Their situation has prompted concern from the nearby community of Aus, a small town on the fringes of the Namib-Naukluft National Park to the north and Tsau //Khaeb National Park to the south. The horses are the lifeblood of the economy, drawing tourists who come to see them living amid inhospitable sand dunes and the barren plains of Garub.

""We've got about ... 800 local people, and of that 130 are actively involved in tourism,"" hotel owner Bernd Roemer told CNN last year. ""If an attraction like the horses would fall away it will not kill tourism completely, but it will make a strong indent.""

""Really there (are) no work opportunities in Aus,"" added resident Tuuli Martin, ""the only work opportunities ... are lodges.""

Biologist Telane Greyling says the wild horse population has declined from 286 in 2012 to just 65 adults. The future of the herd rests on a few precious foals, yet only one, named Zohra, has survived to see its first birthday in the past seven years.

Problem predator

Historically, the horses have faced multiple battles. In the 1980s, new park boundaries cut off a portion of their roaming area. In the early 1990s, a prolonged drought killed some horses (an event which brought Greyling to Aus). For the past 20 years spotted hyenas have been a concern.

""In 2000 they took about two foals, then it was quiet,"" Greyling recalled. ""(In) 2003 they started coming in again and a little more often."" During 2012 there were 50 foals born, Greyling said, and by the end of 2012 the hyenas started attacking those foals. ""By the end of 2013 they were able to ambush and pull down an adult horse,"" she added.

Hyenas have been responsible for scores of horse deaths, but complicating matters, the problem predator is also in danger. ""In a lot of areas, like Namibia, they are vulnerable (to) extinction,"" said Karl Fester, a hyena researcher at Namibian conservation group N/a'an ku sê Foundation, who estimates hyena numbers in the country have dropped from 2,000-3,000 in 1998 to less than 1,000 in 2019.

The two species, one native, one not, have created a conservation conundrum. In early 2019 the Ministry of Environment and Tourism (MET) reported it had killed three hyenas thought to have preyed on foals, after attempts to relocate them had failed. The act proved controversial in the eyes of some conservationists.

In the middle of last year, the MET drew up a 2020-2029 management plan for Namib horses, which included supplemental feeding and water, and predator management. Hyenas would not be killed or captured but would be scared off to protect horses. The horses would not be moved, but in times of drought and severe predation they would be fenced off.

Drought has been the main concern for 2020's new foals, says Greyling.

During the Covid-19 pandemic tourist numbers have dwindled. ""The last few weeks (felt) like we have the place to ourselves again,"" says Christine Swiegers, secretary of the Namibia Wild Horse Foundation.

When visitors return, they will hopefully be able to see Zohra and this year's new foals -- six at the time of writing, according to Greyling. Buoying their prospects, the drought which had claimed other horses has now broken, with small tufts of grass growing on the plains.

A single good year does not erase long-term problems, however. ""Even without predation, it's the seven-year generation gap that is a threat to the future of the population,"" Greyling explains. ""It means that in 2026 there's going to be no mare that's in the age group 7-15 years, which is the main reproductive age of the population.""",2020-07-14,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/namibia-wild-horses-spc-intl/index.html
Aisha Salaudeen,How Flutterwave is helping SMEs in Africa 'keep the lights on' during the pandemic,"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) Before coronavirus pandemic, Rovingheights , a book distribution business based in two Nigerian cities made sales daily from online and walk-in orders.

The stores were also a hive for book lovers who attended reading events in Lagos, the country's bustling metropolis, and in Abuja, its capital.

But as the virus spread to the country, forcing a lockdown that lasted several weeks in some of its major cities in March, Rovingheights says it was forced to temporarily close down its stores and online operations.

The Roving Height bookstore is also used for small events like book readings

Adedotun Eyinade, co-founder of Roving Heights told CNN that sales dropped significantly during the lockdown, leaving the business with no choice but to cut down on employee salaries in April.

""We weren't making a lot of sales and the logistics of delivering books during the lockdown was difficult because book stores were not among the essential services allowed to operate,"" he said.

""April was difficult. It was like the poorest sales in about two years for us,"" he added.

In Nigeria, small and medium enterprises such as Rovingheights account for 96% of businesses and 84% of jobs, and for the last five years, they have contributed to around half of Nigeria's GDP , according to online publication, Stears Business.

Many sectors in the country such as aviation, leisure, and real estate have been impacted by the spread of coronavirus.

Airlines, for example, are shut down as all airports in the country have been closed to contain the virus.

A free online store for businesses

As businesses like Rovingheights continue to feel the impact of Covid-19, a Lagos and San Francisco-based tech company, Flutterwave , has built a digital store for business owners, allowing them to display and sell their products online.

The company's core business is digital payments and it joined forces last year with Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba's Alipay to offer digital payments between Africa and China.

Founder Olugbenga Agboola told CNN that Flutterwave store was created in response to the current pandemic which has infected more than 115,000 people on the continent as of May 27.

Agboola said the company noticed that many SMEs did not have an online presence which was a critical way of making sales in the wake of the pandemic.

""You have small companies trying to sell to their customers and can't earn due to Covid-19, they are all shut down. So, we thought, what can we do to help them keep the light on? How can we help them move their sales online and settle customers?

Then we came up with the Flutterwave store that allows any small business anywhere in the world to go online, create a profile, and upload their product online and start selling,"" he said.

They can also set prices and choose to integrate their own delivery system or use Flutterwave's delivery partners such as Sendbox in Nigeria and Sendy in Kenya.

""The SME owner has access to analytics on the platform. They can see who is paying them and from where, they can pay suppliers and staff from the platform. It's a one-stop-shop,"" Agboola explained.

Joining the Flutterwave store is free and businesses are only charged a small payment fee for their transactions, he said.

Using the Flutterwave store

More than 1,000 businesses from across Africa have so far signed up to sell their products using the store, according to Agboola.

One of them is Rovingheights . With the lockdown now lifted, the business has partially resumed operations and is in the process of trying to get back on track.

""When the storefront opened, I was like, this is exciting. I felt it was a good way to reach out to more people. So, it's just one of the things we did to get through to more customers,"" owner Eyinade said.

Joining Flutterwave store, despite their own existing online presence, has been a boost for the company, he added.

""One of the highlights of our month was just getting people telling us they saw our store on Flutterwave. We had a lot of feedback like that so that was useful for us,"" he said.

The store, which is open to any type of business on the continent will continue to run post coronavirus, according to Agboola.

""Our goal is to continue to help SMEs scale their products. We want to help them keep their lights on.""",2020-05-28,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/05/28/africa/flutterwave-coronavirus-africa/index.html
Stephanie Bailey,Mami Wata: The surf brand changing the perception of surfing in Africa,"Cape Town (CNN Business) When a South African surf company wanted to put African culture on the global surfing map, it knew it needed a distinct African symbol.

It chose the name Mami Wata or ""Mother Ocean,"" a mermaid-like spirit from West African folklore with long, flowing hair who, followers believe, can charm snakes.

The Cape Town brand designs and produces surf wear, surfboards and accessories. Launched in 2017, it aims to move perceptions of surf culture away from western stereotypes and towards ""the power of African surf.""

Surf company Mami Wata is aiming to represent the growing diversity of African surfing.

""Surfing's history has been told through the lens of Australian brands and American brands, which is largely a blond-haired, blue-eyed story, whereas actually there's a lot of people that story isn't relevant for,"" Mami Wata's co-founder Nick Dutton said.

The company is trying to change that by telling a different story.

Stephanie Bailey,This luxury ice cream is made from insects,"(CNN) After a long day under the beating South African sun, an ice cream might be a tempting treat.

But would you be able to enjoy it if you knew it was made from bug ""milk?""

Gourmet Grubb, a Cape Town-based start-up, is hoping to use ice cream to introduce the public to the world of eating insects.

Its luxury ice cream uses EntoMilk , a dairy alternative made by blending the larvae of a tropical insect known as the black solider fly.

The UN predicts that the world will need to double food production to feed the global population by 2050 and has long promoted insect farming as a sustainable alternative protein source to traditional livestock.

Everybody loves ice cream

""We set out to change the way insects were seen, produced and used in the food industry,"" said Leah Bessa, who co-founded Gourmet Grubb in 2017.

Although over 1,900 insect species are estimated to be consumed by humans worldwide, insects are yet to reach the mainstream of Western cuisine.

The insect ""milk"" ice cream is made with natural ingredients, such as raw honey, cocoa, spices and organic peanut butter.

""We were expecting a lot of push back, however people have been extremely open minded,"" Bessa told CNN. ""Everybody loves ice cream.""

The ice cream flavors include chocolate, peanut butter and Christmas spices. According to Bessa, EntoMilk has ""a slightly earthy undertone"" and gives the ice cream ""a rich, creamy taste.""

But it's not just about the taste -- Bessa says insect ice cream is also high in nutrients. According to Gourmet Grubb EntoMilk is five times higher in protein than dairy.

According to the UN, it is widely accepted that insects provide nutrients that are comparable to meat and fish.

""Insects are inherently high in fat and protein and minerals,"" said Bessa. ""The black solider fly has protein and fat content comparable to beef, and zinc, iron and calcium that are much higher than that of beef.""

EntoMilk is also lactose-free and gluten-free, and unlike dairy milk it does not contain any carbohydrates or sugars.

Environmentally friendly

""We decided to focus on an industry [food] that is under a lot of pressure due to animal welfare and environmental concerns,"" said Bessa. ""Insects aren't sentient beings, and they only grow in the conditions in which they thrive, so the farming conditions cater to their animal welfare needs.""

EntoMilk is a dairy alternative made from insects. It is full of nutrients and environmentally friendly to farm and produce.

According to Gourmet Grubb, liter for liter , EntoMilk is more water and energy efficient to produce than any dairy milk or dairy milk alternatives.

""Insects need very little water, feed and space to grow,"" Bessa explained. ""They also produce little/no greenhouse gases compared to traditional livestock.""

Because insects can be farmed indoors in small, controlled environments they can be reared in urban areas, reducing the impact of transporting the milk to the city. It also means they are less at risk of being impacted by external climate patterns, which would affect cattle and crops.

There is also potential for insect farming to reduce waste.

""Some insects, like the black solider fly larvae, have the ability to feed on a wide range of organic matter,"" said Bessa. ""For example, the spent grain left over from brewing beer is used to feed the larvae.""

The future of food?

Currently, Gourmet Grubb's ice cream is only distributed in South Africa, but the global edible insects market is predicted to reach $1.2 billion by 2023.

As well as ice cream, Gourmet Grubb helps develop savoury dishes. These are polenta fries made with mopani worm powder.

Last month, Gourmet Grubb also opened a concept popup store, which included savory insect dishes such as insect powder pasta, chickpea black-larvae croquettes and mopani worm hummus, to serve alongside its ice cream.

""We need to find alternatives that will be able to sustain the growing population and create a sustainable and environmentally friendly farming system,"" said Bessa.

""The only way EntoMilk can truly make a difference and reduce the pressures of traditional dairy is if it is accepted and consumed on a global scale.""",2019-07-25,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/07/25/business/gourmet-grubb-insect-ice-cream-intl/index.html
Christina Maxouris,"Miami is now the coronavirus epicenter as cases surge, one expert says","(CNN) With more than 2,000 patients hospitalized and hundreds in ICUs, ""Miami is now the epicenter of the pandemic,"" one infectious disease expert said Monday, comparing the South Florida metropolitan area to the city where the pandemic originated.

""What we were seeing in Wuhan -- six months ago, five months ago -- now we are there,"" Lilian Abbo, with the Jackson Health System said during a press conference hosted by the Miami-Dade County mayor.

The Chinese city of Wuhan, the original epicenter of the coronavirus crisis, went into a 76-day lockdown in late January after a deadly outbreak infected and killed thousands. The first known cases of the virus were first detected in the city in December . By mid-April , officials reported more than 50,000 infections. Miami-Dade County has recorded more than 64,000 infections so far, according to state data.

In the past 13 days, Miami-Dade County has seen staggering increases in the number of Covid-19 patients being hospitalized (68%), in the number of ICU beds being used (69%) and in the use of ventilators (109%), according to the latest data released by Miami-Dade County Government.

""We need your help as media communicators to help the community understand that we're just not repeating the same thing over and over just to give you trouble, we really need your help,"" Abbo said, directing the comments to reporters.

The plea echos the requests from some other leaders in the state and across the country who have seen new cases spike in the past weeks as Americans flocked back outside following weeks-long lockdowns.

When states began lifting restrictions, images quickly emerged of pool parties, packed beaches, reopened bars and holiday celebrations with no social distancing or face masks. Health officials warned then of what they're now reporting: clusters that are often traced back to Americans who didn't heed to reopening guidelines weeks ago.

More than 3.3 million people have now tested positive nationwide -- but the true number of infections could be much higher, experts have said, as at least 40% of those who contract the virus show no symptoms, according to a new estimate by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

With no way to control the rapid spread of the virus and with thousands possibly infecting others unknowingly, both local and state officials have been forced to rethink more restrictions and in some cases, possibly a second round of lockdowns.

In Houston, where hospitals are already overwhelmed with patients and hitting ICU capacity, Mayor Sylvester Turner said Monday he proposed a two-week shutdown to the governor following a surge of cases.

""I do think we are going to need to shut down for a period of time. I am proposing two weeks, or at the very minimum, to return to phase one,"" Turner said. ""We need to reset, especially in light of the fact that next month, you know, kids, we are talking about returning to school.""

In Atlanta, the mayor also tried to revert the city to the first phase of reopening -- where residents are ordered to stay at home except for essential trips. That decision was slammed by Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, who said it was ""legally unenforceable.""

More than half of US states have now halted or rolled back their reopening plans in hopes of preventing further spread. The end of the pandemic is nowhere near in sight, the country's leading infectious disease expert said Monday, but that doesn't have to mean a new wave of shutdowns -- as long as communities follow the rules.

""You don't necessarily need to shut down again, but pull back a bit. And then, proceed in a very prudent way, observing the guidelines of going from step to step,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci said during a webinar with the Stanford School of Medicine on Monday.

States reimpose restrictions

Amid an uptick in cases, at least three states announced restrictions Monday, including California, New Mexico and Oregon.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom said indoor activities at restaurants, bars, wineries, tasting rooms, movie theaters, family entertainment centers, zoos, and museums should shut down.

The 30 counties that are on the state's watch list will need to close indoor operations for fitness centers, places of worship, offices for non-critical sectors, personal care services, hair salons and barbershops and malls, the governor said.

In New Mexico, which has recorded at least 20% of its total infections in the past two weeks, an order from the governor puts in place restrictions on indoor seating at restaurants and breweries once again in response to more cases.

Restaurants and breweries can seat people outside at 50% capacity and may continue to operate take out and delivery services. The new orders also tighten restrictions on gyms and other businesses including tattoo parlors and salons.

""Unfortunately, our state's dramatically rising case numbers reflect that those behavior modifications and precautions have either not been taken seriously or taken up by enough people,"" Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said in a statement.

And Oregon Gov. Kate Brown also took new measures Monday, expanding face covering requirements and prohibiting indoor gatherings of more than 10 people. ""Either people will adhere to this requirement and be a positive force for stopping Covid-19, or I will be forced to take more restrictive measures,"" the governor said.

Expert: Wear masks or watch economy go 'to hell'

As cases climb, experts are also dialing up their calls for Americans to take precautions -- and wear face masks. But more than two dozen states don't have a statewide mask mandate.

""You have a choice,"" Dr. George Rutherford, a professor at the University of California, San Francisco, said. ""You can be locked down as the economy goes to hell, or you can wear a mask.""

The stern warning is one of many repeated by experts in recent months as communities emerged from lockdowns but have now imposed new restrictions to contain the spread of the virus.

In Texas, which pushed for one of the most aggressive reopenings, Gov. Greg Abbott warned residents ""the worst is yet to come. "" Abbott has issued an executive order requiring residents in counties with 20 or more active coronavirus cases to wear face coverings in public.

to wear one in public for months. President Donald Trump also made his first appearance in front of the press with a face mask on over the weekend, after refusingto wearone in public for months.

Delays in testing results

The surging US cases are also causing a delay in test results from the country's laboratories, according to Quest Diagnostics, a leading provider of diagnostic services.

""Soaring demand"" for a Covid-19 molecular test is ""slowing the time"" it takes the company to provide test results even after rapidly scaling up its capacity, Quest said Monday.

The company can perform up to 125,000 molecular diagnostic tests a day, almost double its capacity two months ago and expects to have the capacity for 150,000 tests a day by the end of July.

But despite the increasing capacity, Quest said it's taking up to a day to process test results for priority cases, including hospital patients, pre-operative patients in acute care settings and symptomatic healthcare workers.

In all other cases, those test results take an average of seven or more days.

There are multiple challenges to ramping up testing even further, the company said, adding it can't reduce turnaround time on results as long as cases are spiking.

More school districts announce they're going virtual

As more states announce restrictions, education leaders have now also been forced to reconsider what the upcoming school semester will look like for students.

The President has already said he's pressuring governors to reopen schools and Florida's department of education said earlier this month it was requiring schools to reopen in August despite its surge of cases. On Monday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said he thinks parents ""should have the option"" of whether or not to send their kids back to school.

But as more teachers and administrators voice fiery oppositions to returning to school - - worried both about their own and students' safety -- districts across the country are now announcing they'll go virtual for the return to school, or at least give parents more options.

California's two largest schools districts announced Monday students will continue learning remotely when classes start next month.

In New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio offered options for partial in-person instruction in the fall. But the state's governor said Monday in order for in-person class to be allowed, a region must be in Phase 4 of reopening, which New York City is not.",2020-07-14,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/14/health/us-coronavirus-tuesday/index.html
Lauren Mascarenhas,"Amid coronavirus surge, health officials urge people to wear masks as a symbol of respect","(CNN) Amid a resurgence in coronavirus cases across the United States, public health officials are asking everyday Americans to do their part. Their message?

A face mask is more than a piece of cloth. It's a sign of respect.

""Wearing a mask, ladies and gentlemen, is respect,"" Dr. Padmini Murthy, professor and global health director at New York Medical College, said during a United Nations panel.

The science is clear. Wearing a face mask is one of the best ways to prevent coronavirus transmission. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people wear face masks both to protect others and to protect themselves.

""We actually have some of the most powerful weapons you can ask to have -- and the most powerful weapon that we have that I know of is wearing face coverings when you're in public,"" CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield said Monday. ""So we ask the American public to all fully embrace the use of face coverings when they're in public.""

Now officials are appealing to the public's sense of solidarity and respect.



Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a member of the White House's coronavirus task force, reiterated the importance of masks this month, saying: ""It signifies one common good and that is care for the public health.""



While face masks are one of the most useful tools available to stop the spread of coronavirus, the rhetoric around wearing them has become heated. Health officials, scientists and some government leaders have implored people to wear masks to reduce transmission, but some have resisted the recommendation, with protests and outright refusals to don face coverings in public.

""This is not about politics,"" said Dr. Leana Wen, Baltimore's former health commissioner, an emergency physician and public health professor at George Washington University. ""This is about each of us showing that we care about one another, that we respect one another.""

Noting that behavior change takes time, Dr. Joshua Barocas, an infectious diseases physician at Boston Medical Center, says wearing a mask can help reduce transmission, help form a good habit and serve as a sign of respect.

""I think beyond simply the viral transmission, wearing a mask can just be a symbol,"" said Barocas. ""It can show people that you are committed to the cause, that you're committed to fighting Covid-19 as a community... committed to protecting other people's lives and their children's lives and their families' lives... committed to having a strong economy open when we're fully ready.""

Dr. Jessica Justman, an infectious diseases specialist and epidemiologist at Columbia University and attending physician at the Columbia University Irving Medical Center, says that messaging plays an important role in the implementation of public health strategies, like this one. She says that it can make a difference when a leader dons a face mask as an example to others.

After months of refusing to be seen wearing a mask in public, President Trump wore a mask on Saturday during a visit to wounded service members at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Maryland. On Sunday, first lady Melania Trump posted a video of herself wearing a mask during a visit to The Mary Elizabeth House, an organization supporting single mothers and their families.

""I've never been against masks, but I do believe they have a time and a place,"" President Trump said ahead of the visit to Walter REed.

Justman says it can also be helpful to have celebrities help disseminate important public health messages, because they are often regarded as opinion leaders in our society.

The actor Tom Hanks, one of the first well-known public figures to announce he had contracted coronavirus, recently said he has ""no respect"" for people who don't wear face masks in public.

Shifting guidance on face masks

Public health officials now face the challenge of walking back some of the initial guidance on face masks, which has evolved over the course of the pandemic.

At first, health officials weren't sure how easily the virus could be transmitted, how far particles carrying the virus could travel or how often asymptomatic infection occurred.

In March, when health workers were experiencing a shortage of personal protective equipment, including face masks, the CDC and World Health Organization advised people not to wear masks if they were not feeling ill, in order to save them for health workers and those who were sick.

Upon learning how easily the virus can be transmitted -- research shows transmission through asymptomatic and presymptomatic individuals may account for about half the coronavirus cases in the US -- the CDC changed its guidance in April, encouraging the public to wear cloth facial coverings.

In June, WHO advised governments to encourage their citizens to wear masks in areas with widespread transmission, when social distancing is difficult. Some politicians, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi lobbied for a federal mask mandate, although White House officials say that is unlikely to happen.

US Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams said on Sunday that a mask mandate would be most effective at the state and local levels. Adams, who has referred to masks as an instrument of freedom, expressed concern about enforcement over mask mandates in an era when Black people are over-policed.

Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.

""If we just try to mandate, it you have to have an enforcement mechanism, and we are in the midst of a moment when over-policing has caused many different individuals to be killed for very minor offenses, and that is an important consideration,"" he said.

As cases have surged over the past few weeks, some states and counties have mandated face masks in public settings and high-risk areas.

Florida, which on Sunday reported the highest number of new cases in a single day of any state during the pandemic, does not currently have a statewide mask mandate.",2020-07-13,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/13/health/masks-respect-coronavirus-wellness/index.html

Sarah Dean,Britain is the worst-hit country outside of the US and Brazil. It STILL won't wear masks,"London (CNN) Walk into any busy store in England or board a train on London's cramped underground system and you will see dozens of people unmasked. And you can forget about face coverings at recently reopened pubs... that's about as likely as a free pint of beer.

This despite the UK being one of the world's worst-hit countries by coronavirus -- it stands third behind Brazil and the United States -- with almost 45,000 fatalities.

And apart from catastrophic death tolls, the three countries at the top of the pandemic chart are those in which people resist wearing masks.

Now, in the same week the World Health Organization confirms there is ""emerging evidence"" of airborne transmission of the coronavirus, senior scientists are urging Britons to take up mask wearing, as two new reports highlight the potential effectiveness of facial coverings.

""The UK is way behind many countries in terms of wearing masks,"" the head of Britain's national academy of sciences, the Royal Society, Venki Ramakrishnan said Tuesday. He claimed not wearing a mask should be regarded as antisocial as drink driving and reasoned that there is a ""growing body of evidence that wearing a mask will help protect others -- and might even protect you.""

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson -- who was hospitalized in intensive care with the virus -- has not previously worn a mask in public until this week.

The PM wore a mask for the first time in public on Friday, in his Uxbridge constituency, west of London.

His comments came as a review of global scientific research on mask wearing was published by a multi-disciplinary group convened by the Royal Society -- Data Evaluation and Learning for Viral Epidemics (DELVE).

And in the United States, a new study showed that one of the main drivers of cases now could be ""silent spreaders,"" or people who are asymptomatic or presymptomatic.

The report, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found that asymptomatic or presymptomatic hosts could be responsible for half of cases, highlighting how masks could be useful in preventing the spread of the virus.

""We have now identified convincing decades-old and apparently forgotten evidence, from the time when surgical masks were made of cloth and were reusable, showing that they help to prevent transmission of airborne infectious agents. There is now even some evidence that masks might directly benefit the wearer,"" its author, Paul Edelstein, Emeritus Professor of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, said.

Edlestein explained: ""There are people without symptoms going about their daily business who are unknowingly breathing out droplets that are carrying the virus. If they had their faces covered the majority of those droplets would be caught before they can infect other people. Wearing face coverings can help save lives and prevent disabling illnesses.""

So if the basics are ""simple to understand,"" as Edlestein put it, why is Britain so reluctant to latch onto masks?

Becoming an outlier

second report , by the Royal Society's SET-C (Science in Emergencies Tasking Covid-19 group) and the British Academy, attempts to explain. It looks at the socio-behavioral factors that could affect the uptake of mask wearing -- and points to how important clear and consistent government policy and messaging around masks is for compliance.

It found that in late April in the UK around 25% of people wore face masks or coverings in public places. This is staggeringly low compared to 83.4% in Italy and 63.8% in Spain in the same period.

People wear face masks in Barcelona, Spain, where those who don't do so in a public space face a 100 euro fine.

April was a month when the UK saw its official daily hospital death toll climb as high as 980. The government only started reporting deaths in all settings, including care homes, at the end of the month. On April 28, at a Downing Street daily briefing, Deputy Chief Scientific Adviser Angela McLean said the government's scientific advisory group SAGE had concluded there was ""weak evidence of a small effect"" in which face masks could prevent an infected person passing coronavirus on to someone else.

At the time, the UK was also battling a critical personal protective equipment (PPE) shortage , with fears that wide public use of face masks could lead to a shortage for healthcare workers.

In the US, where a political and cultural war on masks is now playing out while the virus continues to surge, the Trump administration's top public health experts recently defended their decision to recommend against wearing masks in the pandemic's earliest days, saying it was necessary to prevent a run on equipment that was in short supply.

""I don't regret that,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said during congressional testimony last week. ""At that time, there was a paucity of equipment that our health care providers needed... we did not want to divert masks and PPE away from them.""

Current World Health Organization guidance , updated on June 5, advises governments to encourage the general public to wear masks where there is widespread transmission and physical distancing is difficult, such as on public transport, in shops or in other confined or crowded environments.

Revellers pack a street outside bars in the Soho area of London on July 4, as restrictions are further eased.

The only places where face masks are currently mandatory in England is on public transport, a measure brought in on June 15, and in healthcare settings. According to the government's website, public transport ""differs from enclosed spaces like shops, for example, where people can more easily go outside if social distancing is not possible.""

""People may rightly ask why you have to wear a mask on a train but not in a shop. If guidance is inconsistent people will follow their own preferences,"" Ramakrishnan said. He argued British people might ""not really understand the benefits or are not convinced of them.""

There have also been cracks in a UK-wide approach on masks, with the devolved nations having the power to decide their own coronavirus measures. Northern Ireland is in line with England in mandating masks on public transport but not shops. Scotland has gone one step further and made it mandatory to wear face coverings in shops from July 10. In Wales, masks are not mandatory in shops or on public transport.

In Parliament on Tuesday, UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the government will review guidance for whether the public should wear face masks in supermarkets and retail shops in England.

When asked for a review timeframe, a government spokesperson at the Department of Health told CNN: ""As we ease lockdown measures, face coverings can help us protect each other and reduce the spread of the disease if people are suffering from coronavirus, but not showing symptoms. We continue to advise individuals to wear face coverings in enclosed public spaces where social distancing is not possible.

""Everyone should maintain a 2-meter distance wherever possible. Where this is not possible wearing a face covering is one of the ways people can manage risk at a 1-meter distance.""

Although the uptake of face masks or coverings may have increased in the UK since late April, the Set-C report highlights how many countries implemented a policy requiring the general public to wear face masks and coverings in all public places much earlier, by mid-March 2020.

Taiwan, South Korea and mainland China, all places with widespread mask use, have seen greater success in preventing major outbreaks or reining them in once they begin.

As second and third waves begin to emerge in countries that have eased up coronavirus restrictions, mask wearing has up until this week been shunned and even ridiculed by the leaders of the worst hit countries -- the US and Brazil -- as they struggle to escape a devastating first wave of the pandemic.

President Donald Trump had refused to wear a mask in public for months until a visit to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Saturday. This came after some of the President's aides practically begged him to agree. It is hoped it will encourage skeptical Trump supporters to do the same. Meanwhile, President Jair Bolsonaro is being sued for removing his mask during an interview in which he announced that he has the coronavirus.

The University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) gives two versions of forecasts for the US: one in which everyone wears masks, and one in which they don't. This week the IHME model projected as many 208,000 American coronavirus deaths by November 1, but just under 163,000 if most people wear a face mask to help contain the spread of the virus.

Why the resistance?

""To understand why people don't wear face coverings it is essential to examine behavioural factors such as the public's understanding about masks and how to wear and re-use cloth coverings,"" said Melinda Mills, Director of the Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science at the University of Oxford and lead author on the SET-C report.

""What is clear is that it isn't the public's fault for not wearing masks in the UK. Rather, consistent policies and effective public messaging is vital, which have even differed across England, Scotland and Wales,"" Mills argued.

Notably, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson -- who was hospitalized in intensive care with the virus -- had not, until Friday, worn a mask in public, yet Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon had.

First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon wears a Tartan face mask as she visits a retail park last month in Edinburgh.

Mills said people in countries like Italy and Spain, without a previous history of mask wearing, have ""rapidly adopted face coverings during the Covid-19 period largely because the authorities provided them with a consistent policy and clear guidelines to understand why they should wear them.""

Spain, for example, which has recorded more than 28,000 deaths, has legally required everyone over the age of six to wear face masks indoors and outdoors in public spaces when a minimum two-meter distance is not possible since May 21. In June, the country's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez ordered that this remain the case even after the country's state of emergency ended on June 21.

The Set-C report, which states consistent and effective public messaging is ""vital"" to public adherence to wearing face masks and coverings, highlights a UK government tweet on June 27. The report said the ""face coverings make the shop safer"" message in the tweet was good for its ""altruism"" message but bad because it focused only on protecting others and not self protection. The campaign image featured an older woman, who the report says is already in the vulnerable group and less likely to break the face covering advice.

The report also concludes that a lack of uptake of face masks and coverings in the UK may also be attributed to factors such as an ""over-reliance on an evidence-based medicine approach,"" ""inconsistent and changing advice from supranational organizations (WHO, European Center for Disease Prevention and Control),"" and ""supply concerns of PPE shortages of surgical face masks.""

It's not too late

""As the government equivocates, unlike our European neighbours, the British public may end up being the 'control group' for the face mask experiment the government has been demanding all along,"" scientist Dr. Babak Javid wrote in April, in an opinion piece for The Guardian newspaper, as he urged Britons to take up mask wearing.

Since then, the consultant in infectious diseases at Cambridge University hospitals in England and professor at the Tsinghua University School of Medicine in Beijing has moved to the US to take up a new post as associate professor of experimental medicine at the University of California San Francisco. He's noticed masks are ""much more visible"" in the US than the UK, and he puts that down to the ""establishment"" unifying around masks early on in the pandemic.

In the US ""many shops here have not hesitated in mandating masks if you want to go and use their store... shops don't seem to be suffering as a result,"" he said in a phone interview with CNN.

However, mask wearing is by no means universal across the US, a country where rebellion runs through its political DNA. Different states have enacted different measures and passionate ""anti-mask"" protesters are rebelling against mandatory face coverings . On April 3, Trump announced the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was urging Americans to wear a mask when they leave their homes. But he declared he wouldn't be wearing one himself. ""With the masks, it is going to be really a voluntary thing,"" the President said. ""You can do it. You don't have to do it. I am choosing not to do it.""

Javid believes the UK has indeed become somewhat of a mask experiment ""control group,"" ""certainly compared with most European countries,"" although he points out the Netherlands and the Nordic countries also have very low uptake of face mask use. There are confounders, he said, ""because of the UK's very long lockdown and... because the UK was hit very hard... case counts are really dramatically falling in the UK now, so it's hard to disentangle.""

""I think there is reasonably compelling evidence that states that mandated masks earlier cut down their transmission rates more quickly in the upswing phase of the outbreak,"" he added.

Javid thinks the UK government's attempt to make the mask mandate as loose as possible has meant ""a very muddled and fairly watered-down message.""

""They were so worried about securing PPE supplies, so then the focus shifted to face coverings and the reality is not all face coverings are created equal. That's just the bare bones truth, a loose scarf is always going to be less effective than a well-fitted, well-made cloth mask,"" Javid argued.

""If you are going to have a lowest common denominator message that any face covering will do it's then hard to hand on your heart and say this is going to protect you. Whereas, actually, a well made cloth mask will protect you. I think that's incontrovertible.""

He said ""in terms of economics masks are one of the most cost-effective interventions we can have"" in the fight to stop the spread of coronavirus. He is not in favor of ""perpetual lockdown"" and believes masks are one way of trying to get out of lockdown quicker but they are not the beginning and the end of the pandemic. ""This isn't a simple solution, it's just one part of a package.""

Customers enjoy their drinks in Soho, London, earlier in July as pubs, restaurants, hotels and hairdressers in England reopen.

After a deadly first wave of the virus, Javid believes ""it's not too late"" for the UK. ""Now is a great time to increase our mask usage because it might allow us to open up even more and more safely."" This is a claim echoed by Royal Society President Ramakrishnan, who said: ""The virus has not been eliminated, so as we lift lockdown and people increasingly interact with each other we need to use every tool we have to reduce the risk of a second wave of infection.""

On July 4, England's pubs and restaurants swung open their doors after three months of lockdown. Prime Minister Johnson urged drinkers to behave responsibly, but footage last weekend showed large crowds outside city pubs with no social distancing and few revelers wearing masks. Since then at least three venues have had to shut again, after some customers tested positive for Covid-19 following their visit that weekend.

Will we ever see Brits wearing masks in pubs? ""The reason why pubs and clubs are higher risk activities is because you are much more likely to be engaging in speech and we know that speech is associated with transmission,"" Javid said. ""Realistically how many people will wear a mask, take it off for a quick sip of their pint and then put it back on again straight away? I just can't see that happening.""",2020-07-12,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/12/health/britain-masks-intl-gbr/index.html
Kristen Rogers,Johns Hopkins' dashboard: The people behind the pandemic's most visited site,"(CNN) If the year 2020 is good for anything, it's the lesson that during a crisis, anyone who builds a better mousetrap will find the world beating a path to his door.

A humble team at Johns Hopkins University in Maryland reminded the world of late poet Ralph Waldo Emerson's phrase when they created a real time tracking map of coronavirus cases and deaths.

And the world came to their door. They report that the site, plus downloads of its data, hosts three to five billion interactions daily. By their measurement, interactions include uses of the public dashboard and requests from a separate website for the underlying data used by news outlets and others who design their own maps and graphics.

Government agencies, public health departments, the public and news outlets, including CNN , regularly rely onit for the latest updates on the confirmed cases, deaths and recoveries connected to this harrowing disease.

""We were collecting data on a new virus that nobody understood at a time [when] there was not a single web page dedicated to Covid-19 case count,"" said Lauren Gardner, the project's chief and an associate professor in, and codirector of, the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins Whiting School of Engineering.

Professor Lauren Gardner has experience modeling infectious diseases.

From December 2019 to January 2020, Ensheng Dong, Gardner's first-year PhD student, heard from family in China who regularly reported how the outbreak was worsening and upending their lives. After passing an exam that cleared him to earn his PhD, tracking confirmed cases in China was what he wanted to tackle next.

First-year PhD student Ensheng Dong helped create the dashboard in less than a day.

On January 21, over coffee during a weekly research meeting, Dong proposed this idea to Gardner.

His background in spatial data visualization and Gardner's past in modeling infectious diseases converged to create the first iteration of the dashboard — which they finished that night and published the next day. The map's alarming red dots then reflected only 320 reported cases — mostly in China, the rest in Thailand, Japan and South Korea.

""He's gotten to play some pretty major roles in some really central problems to the society for someone that's six months into a degree program,"" Gardner said. ""I keep telling him that he needs to not get used to this and it's not normal. And [that] the rest of his PhD experience is going to be really boring, but I don't think he believes me.""

For two weeks from dawn till dusk, Dong lived and breathed the dashboard; it took precedence over his free time outside of class and soon the classes themselves. With Gardner's blessing, he pushed back a required course until the fall semester.

Has maintaining those responsibilities affected his health in any way? ""Not really,"" he said. ""I think this is what the research should do. The responsibility for this dashboard gives me energy.""

But as cases became globally widespread, they needed help.

""Initially, [I worried about my family]; right now, it's their time to worry about my situation in the US,"" Dong said.

Gardner and her team work to maintain the Covid-19 dashboard, built by her team at Johns Hopkins University.

What was once a modest goal to fill a research gap in a field with antiquated methods for disease tracking is now a tool widely used around the world.

They had no idea ""that it would evolve into something that literally impacts almost everybody's life on the planet,"" Gardner said.

From erratic data to the map on our screens

About 25 people from multiple disciplines now support the dashboard, including graduate students and senior software developers and research scientists primarily based in Maryland, California and England.

Like a lot of people, they're working from home. Their days begin with Zoom calls during which they hash out to-do lists and pressing issues. The conversation continues through a myriad of Slack channels, emails and phone calls.

""It's efficient, but it's boring,"" Gardner said. ""I really miss a bit of the real, in-person world.""

Gardner is in charge, so everyone involved reports to her. Her daily to-do list involves running a research group of PhD students, overseeing data additions and design for the dashboard and making strategic decisions for the development of the dashboard. She spends about half of her time on research based on data from the map.

From dozens of sources including local health departments and data aggregating websites, the dashboard reports cases from more than 3,500 locations — at the province level in China; at the county level in the US; and at subnational and national levels elsewhere.

Because they update the dashboard at least hourly, they've had to shift from manual data collection to leaning more on automatic culling — the team praised data wizards at the university's Applied Physics Laboratory for creating a code that periodically travels to trusted websites and scrapes for data. For independent research and the US government, the APL provides technological systems engineering, development and analysis.

The automated code aggregates the data and publishes it into GitHub , a software development platform. An anomaly detection system reviews every number that comes in and holds back anything that doesn't make sense, explained Ryan Lau, a graduate software engineer in the lab. Sometimes the web sources are technologically unreliable, but the case data is accurate in regard to what has been reported, Gardner said.

The teams manually validate and approve numbers before letting them be processed through a geographic information systems tool into the visualizations we see

Ryan Lau, a graduate software engineer in the university's Applied Physics Laboratory, plays a key role in collecting the data.

""Not to be cliche, but a picture is worth a thousand words,"" Lau said. The APL team works on building and maintaining the automated capabilities of the data-pulling code.

Frequent updates and data from multiple sources is what makes the dashboard different from the World Health Organization's tracker, which counts only states and nations, said Beth Blauer, executive director of the university's Centers for Civic Impact, which supports governments and nonprofits aiming to make data-driven change.

Blauer's work with the Centers for Civic Impact is her day job, but she also began working with the data in March after she used the map to assess the risk of traveling.

Beth Blauer helps run the US dashboard.

She's also a single mom. ""[My kids] deserve some kind of an award for the way that they've been able to stick with me through this,"" Blauer said.

The map places at people's fingertips ""information upon which they can make really important decisions,"" said Jennifer Nuzzo, who works on projects similar to Blauer's, but for the Coronavirus Resource Center. Nuzzo is an associate professor in the university's Bloomberg School of Public Health and a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.

Jennifer Nuzzo, an associate professor in the university's Bloomberg School of Public Health, also contributes to the US dashboard.

""For governments, it's about very high consequence decisions about protecting health and supporting the economy. And for people, it's about how to protect yourself and your loved ones.""

The challenges of informing the world

Work that relays ever-changing information from thousands of places comes with hurdles. There's no international modus operandi for how to count coronavirus infections and deaths.

The dashboard's infrastructure is more stable these days, but the ""sources and information coming in are still changing quite a bit,"" Gardner said.

Stumbling blocks have included when the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggested local health officials switch from reporting only confirmed cases and deaths to also probable cases and deaths

And sometimes the numbers between state and county health departments don't match up — they report differently or at varying times.

Each time these transitions happen, the team has to figure out how to handle them.

The biggest challenge is trying to collect data ""from multiple locations simultaneously and provide it in real time while all of those dynamics are at play,"" Gardner said. Knowing there are so many eyes on it and having to explain it is difficult, too, she added.

The dashboard hasn't been without controversy . The soundness of data aggregating website Worldometer is considered questionable by some academics, but the site is one of many sources from which the JHU dashboard pulls data.

Lessons on human behavior and how a virus travels

Besides the dashboard, the data also supports analyses for the university's Coronavirus Resource Center , which aims to help understanding of the virus and policymaking.

draws ""distinct connections"" between states' decisions in regard to closing and reopening phases and ""how the pandemic is unfolding at the local level,"" Blauer said. The US state policy timeline is an interactive graphic thatdraws ""distinct connections"" between states' decisions in regard to closing and reopening phases and ""how the pandemic is unfolding at the local level,"" Blauer said.

A county's health care capacity and access, demographics and disease data in comparison to its state are three factors starting to reveal those disparities.

Data on testing and contact tracing could illuminate long-term patterns regarding race, socioeconomic status and systemic barriers to testing access — an effort headed by Blauer and Nuzzo.

""There is nothing so stark than looking at the disproportionate amount of Black and Latino people that are [contracting and] dying from this disease, knowing there is no medical safety net for them and also understanding that there are deliberate decisions that aren't taking their best interests in mind,"" Blauer said.

""This is the piece that I think has been the most difficult for me.""

How they're coping during the pandemic

For a long time, Gardner felt removed from reality since busyness left no time for reflection on what was happening around her. Since the dashboard processes have stabilized, she's been able to focus more on the circumstances.

""I would say that I'm probably one of the more frustrated people with the situation, because I am just so well aware of the patterns, the trends, the direction we're going and mistakes we're making,"" she said. ""Watching that happen ... it's extra frustrating.""

Dong frets about his family in China, but the work gets into his subconscious as well. His pandemic-era dreams look like worrying over the quality of the data, which makes him incredibly anxious, he said.

Seeing the contextual reality of the data and thus being able to understand relative risks helps Nuzzo cope with what might otherwise be constant worry. But she also ""can't shut off the pandemic.""

""It's both my job and my life in a way that usually at the end of your workday, you get a break from what you're working on,"" she said. ""We don't escape it at all. That can be just emotionally exhausting.""

What the future holds

The need for this kind of data and analysis isn't going away any time soon, Nuzzo presumed.

""I've been focusing on [pandemic preparedness] for 20 years,"" she said. ""I unfortunately know that we live in an age of epidemics ... We are building an important process and infrastructure that I hope we never have to use again, but data tells me we very well may have to use that again.""

Considering how the dashboard will be used during and after the pandemic has been fruitful.

Philanthropic donations, including from Bloomberg Philanthropies and the Stavros Niarchos Foundation , have been the additional support needed to keep the research train chugging and flexible in regard to what the team can pursue.

""I believe there's a vision of the world in which if outbreaks of a new virus happen, we can also have the public health capabilities to stop the virus in its place, to prevent it from becoming a global pandemic,"" Nuzzo said. ""But as we're seeing now, we have more work to do in order to make that happen.""",2020-07-11,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/11/health/johns-hopkins-covid-19-map-team-wellness-trnd/index.html
Marshall Cohen,"'Broken heart syndrome' has increased during the Covid-19 pandemic, small study suggests","(CNN) A study published Thursday found a significant increase in ""broken heart syndrome"" at two Ohio hospitals among some patients who don't have coronavirus, suggesting that the physical, social and economic stressors from the pandemic are taking a physical toll.

Stress-induced cardiomyopathy or Takotsubo syndrome -- which is often called ""broken heart syndrome"" -- occurs when the heart muscles weaken, leading to chest pain and shortness of breath. It presents like a heart attack, but is triggered by stressful events , not blockages in the bloodstream. It can be deadly in rare cases, but patients usually recover within days or weeks.

Researchers at the Cleveland Clinic studied patients at two hospitals with heart trouble who were treated this spring, and compared them to patients with similar issues over the past two years. Patients during the pandemic were two times likelier to have broken heart syndrome, according to the study, which was published in the medical journal JAMA Network Open

The study looked at 1,914 patients from five distinct two-month periods, including a sample of more than 250 patients hospitalized in March and April, during the early peak of the pandemic. The study concluded that the increase was likely connected to the ""psychological, social, and economic stress"" caused by the pandemic, which includes ""imposed quarantine, lack of social interaction, strict physical distancing rules, and its economic consequences in people's lives.""

""The pandemic has created a parallel environment which is not healthy,"" said Dr. Ankur Kalra, the cardiologist who led the study. ""Emotional distancing is not healthy. The economic impact is not healthy. We've seen that as an increase in non-coronavirus deaths, and our study says that stress cardiomyopathy has gone up because of the stress that the pandemic has created.""

Jay Croft,Florida publicly discloses hospitalizations as the US breaks another case record,"(CNN) Another record-setting day of Covid-19 cases across the US came with a spotlight on Florida, which publicly released its number of coronavirus patients currently in the hospital after weeks of pressure to do so.

A total of 6,991 people are hospitalized because of the virus, the state's Agency for Health Care Administration said Friday.

Friday brought 63,900 new Covid-19 cases nationwide, a single-day record, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The new high comes as many states set records in infection rates and hospitalizations

While 29 states saw an increase in new cases compared to last week, Miami-Dade County in Florida on Friday reported a staggering 28% positivity rate, or the percentage of people tested who test positive for the coronavirus.

Mayor Carlos Gimenez's office said the goal is to not exceed a positivity rate of 10%, but the county has exceeded the 18% mark for the past 14 days. On Thursday, it was 33.5%.

Over the past 13 days, hospitalizations in Miami-Dade County have gone up by 74%, the number of beds in intensive care units being used has increased by 88% and the use of ventilators has soared by 123%, according to the latest data from the county government.

""The situation is really concerning here in South Florida,"" Dr. David De La Zerda, the lead ICU physician at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami, told CNN on Friday. ""All the health care workers have a huge burden.""

But Gov. Ron DeSantis said there is no lack of ICU beds in the state

""You've got a lot of beds available,"" DeSantis said at a news conference in Orlando, adding that no major hospital system in the state ""has even gone to like a surge level.""

President Donald Trump traveled to the county on Friday on unrelated business. He was met by five local leaders, including a state senator and Gimenez.

From Miami, Trump traveled to Doral, where he received a briefing at US Southern Command, the US military command that covers the Caribbean and Central and South America. Trump will then go to a church nearby for a roundtable discussion with Venezuelans. After that, Trump will attend a private fundraiser in Hillsboro Beach. He is not scheduled to participate in any events related to the pandemic.

Florida health officials reported 11,433 new Covid-19 cases and 93 deaths, according to data on the Florida Department of Health website.

It's the second time the state's single-day tally topped 11,000, according to CNN's count. The health department reported 11,458 cases on July 4.

California reported 149 coronavirus-related deaths on Thursday, the highest daily total for the state, and total cases topped 300,000 on Friday. California's positivity rate as a 14-day average is climbing and stands at 7.4% with people between the ages of 18-49 accounting for almost 60% of all cases.

After outbreaks and more than two dozen deaths in state prisons, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation announced that 8,000 prisoners will be released early by the end of August.

Texas reported 105 deaths on Thursday, also a 24-hour record for the state, and Gov. Greg Abbott does not anticipate next week will bring any relief.

""I think the numbers are going to look worse as we go into next week, and we need to make sure that there's going to be plenty of hospital beds available in the Houston area,"" Abbott said in an interview with KRIV-TV.

Also setting daily records for new Covid-19 cases were Utah with 850, Louisiana with 2,642 and Georgia with 4,484, health officials said.

Georgia is reactivating a makeshift hospital at the Georgia World Congress Center, a large convention center in downtown Atlanta, amid a rising trend in cases, the governor's office said.

Michigan governor requires face coverings

Following an increase in cases in Michigan, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer signed an executive order requiring a face covering be worn in indoor public spaces. The order requires businesses to refuse service or entry to anyone not wearing a covering, the governor announced in a release.

Violating the order, which goes into effect Monday, could bring a $500 penalty.

There are exceptions, including while people are eating and drinking at a restaurant.

North Carolina set a record Thursday for the highest number of hospitalizations and posted the second highest number of cases for the state, said Gov. Roy Cooper.

""Though North Carolina isn't a surging hot spot like some other states, we could be if we don't stay strong in our fight,"" he said.

Staggering US numbers show pandemic isn't over

According to Johns Hopkins, there are at least 3.18 million cases of coronavirus in the US, and at least 134,059 people have died.

The nation's leading infectious disease expert warned Americans throughout the week that the nation is still ""knee deep"" in the first wave.

""We've never really gotten out of it,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci said in an interview with SiriusXM Doctor Radio airing on Friday. Fauci is the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

Dr. Peter Hotez says he's so alarmed by the rising numbers that he has a hard time sleeping.

""One (reason) is this steep acceleration,"" Hotez, dean of tropical medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, told CNN on Friday morning. ""We're approaching (Fauci's) apocalyptic prediction of 100,000 cases a day.""

Experts say US can stay open -- strategically

While it's impossible to maintain stringent coronavirus restrictions and return to a sense of normalcy, there is a middle ground, Fauci said.

""Rather than think in terms of reverting back down to a complete shutdown, I would think we need to get the states pausing in their opening process. Looking at what did not work well and try to mitigate that,"" Fauci told The Hill's Editor-at-Large Steve Clemons.

The all-or-nothing approach to socialization, and in Florida's case reopening too fast, contributed to the return of the virus, Fauci said on Podcast-19, FiveThirtyEight's weekly podcast on Covid-19.

""There are some governors and mayors that did it perfectly correctly,"" he said. ""But what happened is that many of the citizenry, said, 'You know, well, I'm either going to be locked down or I'm going to let it all rip.'""

Fauci has stressed the risk in congregating, and he recommended Thursday that the nation reevaluate recommendations on when to reopen bars and indoor restaurants, saying they pose one of the ""real problems.""

Even with the restrictions currently in place, only half of Nevada's bars were found to be in compliance, said Gov. Steve Sisolak. As of 11:59 p.m. local time on Friday, bars in certain counties will revert to similar restrictions in Phase 1 of the state's reopening plan.",2020-07-10,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/10/health/us-coronavirus-friday/index.html
Sandee Lamotte,"Can the AC filter in your home, office or local mall protect you from Covid-19?","(CNN) When New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced last week that malls in New York could not reopen until they installed high-efficiency particulate air filters capable of trapping the virus that causes Covid-19, Harvard environmental health researcher Joseph Gardner Allen was thrilled.

""I've been writing consistently since early February about how healthy buildings should be the first line of defense against the novel coronavirus,"" said Allen, who directs the Healthy Buildings program at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

""I'm really grateful that we have a leader in the country -- somewhere -- who was finally talking about healthy buildings, ventilation and filtration,"" Allen said. ""That hasn't happened before. It just hasn't happened.""

A push to action

Allen was one of 239 scientists who wrote an open letter to the World Health Organization, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other health agencies, asking for a change in their guidance to the public on how the novel coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2, can spread.

Current guidance only focuses on ""hand washing, maintaining social distancing, and droplet precautions,"" according to the letter, published Monday in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases

The health agencies are ignoring the tiny droplets of virus that sputter and spray from our mouths, become aerosolized and then float away into the air, the scientists said, as a likely means of transmission.

""They don't want to talk about airborne transmission because that is going to make people afraid,"" co-author Donald Milton, a professor of environmental health at the University of Maryland, told CNN in a prior interview

""The best vaccine against fear is knowledge and empowering people to take care of themselves,"" Milton said. ""Why wearing a mask is important is because it blocks the aerosols at their source, when it is easy to block them.""

Because the CDC and WHO ""have been so slow to acknowledge aerosol transmission is happening, buildings are not putting in appropriate control measures,"" said Allen, who has focused his career on "" sick buildings "" and how they affect worker performance and productivity.

""The prudent and pragmatic approach is to acknowledge that airborne transmission is happening and put in the controls. If we find out in five years, that airborne was 5% of transmission, then OK,"" Allen said. ""But what if it's 20% or 30% and we failed to acknowledge it? That's a problem.""

Indoor settings such as restaurants, nightclubs and places of worship where people may be shouting, talking or singing and spend long periods of time have been associated with outbreaks, the agency said on its website.

""In these outbreaks, aerosol transmission ... cannot be ruled out. More studies are urgently needed to investigate such instances and assess their significance for transmission of COVID-19.""

Still, ""current evidence suggests that transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurs primarily between people through direct, indirect, or close contact with infected people through infected secretions such as saliva and respiratory secretions, or through their respiratory droplets,"" WHO said.

Not a major transmission route

Currently the CDC says ""Covid-19 is thought to spread mainly through close contact from person-to-person,"" through ""respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks.""

""I subscribe to the CDC opinion that the vast majority of transmission occurs within 3 to 6 feet from the infected person. That's the highway where all the traffic is -- where the the vast majority of this virus is transmitted,"" said infectious disease expert Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville.

""Are there side streets where it can become an aerosol and spread into the air? Yes,"" Schaffner said, adding that isn't likely to create a significant transmission route. If future public health investigations find these ""aerosol transmission events are more common than currently thought,"" that could change priorities.

""But I don't think we need to change all the AC units in the US and around the world based on side street traffic,"" Schaffner added. ""We want to attack the high traffic route by the big three -- masks, social distancing and avoiding large groups. Then we'll get virus transmission down.""

A role for aerosols?

mid-March study found SARS-CoV-2 can survive in microscopic respiratory droplets about 2.5 microns in diameter and smaller, which can remain airborne and viable for up to three hours or more.

Marr, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Virginia Tech, rounded up research focusing on the role of smaller airborne particles in the spread of the novel coronavirus. In early May, Harvard's Allen and LinseyMarr, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Virginia Tech, published a paper thatrounded up research focusing on the role of smaller airborne particles in the spread of the novel coronavirus.

""It is impossible for someone to release 'large droplets' (>5 microns) without also releasing smaller ones. Thus, transmission that is purported to occur via the spray of large droplets from a cough could in fact be occurring through inhalation of much smaller droplets at close range,"" the paper said.

Marr, who made a groundbreaking discovery that flu virus could float in the air in microscopic droplets for an hour or more, likes to use cigarettes as a way to explain how viruses spread.

""The smaller microscopic ones that we call aerosols behave kind of like cigarette smoke. So they're going to be more concentrated closer to the smoker, the person who might be infected. As you get farther away, your exposure would be much less,"" Marr said.

Will masks protect against those microscopic floating droplets? Top-rated N95 and surgical-grade masks will, and scientists are scrambling to study and tweak the effectiveness of homemade masks

""For most cloth face masks, there is no inner filtration layer that traps harmful particles,"" said Sara Greenstein, president and CEO of Lydall, one of the companies who signed with the U.S. Department of Defense to produce filtration media for N95 masks.

""Although wearing a cloth face mask is better than nothing, it is no substitute for an N95 or surgical mask, which are precisely engineered, highly technical products,"" Greenstein said.

Even when medical-grade masks are widespread, ventilation systems with highly effective filters are another key way to filter droplets from the air, Allen said.

MERV ratings

In his edict to New York mall owners, Cuomo was talking about HEPA filters, which have the highest MERV ratings, between 17 and 20.

What's MERV? It stands for ""minimum efficiency reporting value,"" and it's how filters are rated in their ability to trap tiny particles. The MERV ratings go from one to 20: Filters with higher MERV ratings are more effective than filters with lower ratings.

At the highest end, HEPA filters are used by hospitals to create sterile rooms for surgeries and to control infectious diseases, and are able to remove 99.97% of dust, pollen, mold, bacteria and other airborne particles with a size as small as 0.3 microns. For comparison, Covid-19 is thought to be between 0.06 to 1.4 microns.

""Filters are rated at their worst performance, so 99.97% is the worst it will do,"" Allen said. ""And that's rated for a particle size of 0.3 microns, but smaller and larger it actually does better. So the point is that it's capturing nearly all particles.""

Unfortunately, most businesses and home owners may find it difficult to retrofit their existing system to accommodate a HEPA filter, or any filter higher than the rating recommended by the system's manufacturer.

Doing so can actually impair the system's performance: Smaller pores in HEPA air filters make it more difficult for it to push air. Using denser filters can affect the efficiency of the unit and strain the fan, while decreasing indoor air quality -- the opposite of what you desire.

""HEPA filtration is not always going to be feasible or practical,"" Allen said. ""But there are other filters that can do the job. What is recommended now by the standard setting body for HVAC is a MERV 13 filter.""

High-efficiency filters in the 13-to-16 MERV range are often used in hospitals, nursing homes, research labs and other places where filtration is important.

""If you're an owner of a home, building or mall, you want to have someone to assess your system and install the largest MERV number filter the system can reliably handle without dropping the volume of air that runs through it,"" advised Erin Bromage, an associate professor of biology at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth.

""In addition, virtually all modern air conditioning systems in commercial buildings have a process called makeup air where they bring in air from outside and condition it and bring it inside,"" said Bromage, a CNN contributor who wrote a blog post in early May -- "" The Risks -- Know Them -- Avoid Them ,"" that got over 13 million views in one week.

Building owners should be looking at increasing the amount of makeup air that is brought inside by opening dampers, Bromage suggested.

""It's worse in regards to energy, but the more outside air we bring in, the more dilution of the virus we have and then the safer you are,"" Bromage said, adding that it's important to also monitor humidity levels.""

""There's sort of a 'Goldilocks' zone for the coronavirus, between 40 and 60% humidity, where it doesn't survive for very long,"" Bromage said.

Below 40% humidity, he said, the infected droplets hang in the air longer, thus providing the opportunity to travel farther to infect people.

""Above 60%, the droplets lose moisture more slowly, and therefore are heavier and more vulnerable to gravity,"" Bromage said, ""which sounds like a great thing.""

""But it actually drops onto surfaces much faster and being wet actually keeps the virus alive and infectious for longer,"" he added.

What to do?

First, focus on following public health recommendations: Wear masks when you go outside, stay away from large crowds and 6 feet from anyone not in your ""quarantine bubble,"" wash your hands with soap frequently, keep your hands away from your face, and try to only go to outdoor locations with excellent air circulation and filtration.

If you have the resources, there are also personal HEPA air purifiers on the market, designed to clean a standard room of a home. Some even come with humidifiers that will measure the air and keep the room between 40% and 60%, while others incorporate UV light technology designed to kill stray particles.

Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.

""Properly balanced UV light will inactivate viruses and bacteria in the air, which just adds an extra layer to the protection coming from the air purifier,"" Bromage said.

Costs range from a few hundred to over a thousand dollars, but don't be fooled by the price tag: You're looking for a machine with a HEPA filter designed for the size of your room -- so measure carefully. Having too small of a machine in a large room won't clean the air -- while having a large system in a small room is a waste of money.

Finally, know that HEPA filters can be pricey and will need frequent attention to keep them in top performance.

Many point to the cost of filters and the expense of retrofitting buildings and say it may not be worth it. That's not always the case, Allen said.

""It's a total misnomer that healthy building strategies and higher ventilation rates and filtration are expensive strategies,"" Allen said. ""When people know and understand how it's transmitted, then they're empowered to make better decisions.

""And that includes right in your home: You'd have people over, open up those windows; you're in your car with somebody else, roll down the window, a few inches,"" Allen said.

""No one strategy alone is going to work. But if we layer enough of these on top of each other, we can significantly reduce risks.""",2020-07-07,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/07/health/covid-19-air-conditioning-ventilation-wellness-scn/index.html
Stefano Pozzebon,Covid-19 forced Venezuelans to head home. But crossing the border isn't easy,"Since at least 2016, nearly 5 million Venezuelans have left their country, according to the UN Refugee Agency , fleeing disastrous poverty and crumbling social and health services. But as the coronavirus pandemic shutters economies across Latin America, many Venezuelans are now being forced to return home -- if their government will let them.

Entering Venezuela in the time of coronavirus is no easy task. Embattled President Nicolas Maduro has claimed that returning migrants could be deliberately infected by other countries in order to spread the virus in Venezuela. His government has limited the number of Venezuelans allowed entry into their own country to approximately 1,000 per week.

According to Venezuelan authorities, at least 56,000 Venezuelans returned between March and mid-June. Colombian authorities keeping track of border crossings believe that at least 60,000 Venezuelan migrants have crossed back into the country through the Colombian city of Cucuta alone since March. They expect tens of thousands more to try to return in the coming weeks.

Why they return

Cucuta, where three bridges cross the Colombia-Venezuela border, is the main transit point for many. ""It's like a giant hourglass,"" said Victor Bautista, Secretary of Migration of Colombia's Norte de Santander Department, where Cucuta is located.

""For the past five years we've seen more than 3 million Venezuelans walk through here, all looking for a way out and better opportunities,"" he said. ""And now it flipped toward Venezuela.""

Pedro Roque traveled, often on foot, the 2,100 miles from Lima, Peru, to the border crossing at Cucuta. He had lost his job working in a chicken restaurant, he said, because of Covid-19. Without a salary, he could no longer afford the rent and decided to go home.

In Peru, average working hours have fallen by as much as 80% in the area around the capital Lima since the beginning of the pandemic, according to the International Labour Organization . And the whole Latin American region has seen an almost three-fold rise in the number of people requiring food assistance, according to data from the UN World Food Programme.

As countries with significant Venezuelan immigrant populations like Argentina, Chile, Peru, Ecuador and Colombia adopted strict lockdown measures to contain the virus, Venezuelan migrants have been left with few options. Most of the migrants CNN spoke with for this story said they worked in the informal economy with no welfare support to rely on during the lockdown.

In Cucuta, Roque sleeps under an awning with three other people as he awaits his turn to cross the border. Social distancing is not a priority, he said. ""Covid is a respiratory disease, right? If someone walked 35, 40 kilometres a day to come here, for weeks, he doesn't have Covid. A sick person would not have survived what we went through,"" he said when asked why he wasn't wearing a mask.

The makeshift camps where people wait to cross the border do not permit social distancing. There are no toilets or running water here, and the largest encampment consists of shelters fashioned from cardboard and black garbage bags under which some 1,300 Venezuelans wait for their turn to go home.

Colombian authorities say they don't know exactly how many people live in the camp. Every time a group leaves, new migrants take their place.

Waiting to be called home

Few would call Venezuela the ideal place to wait out a pandemic.

Ninety-six percent of the population lives below the poverty line according to a recent independent survey by three leading universities in Caracas. As CNN has previously reported , most hospitals in Venezuela lack running water for days at a time, doctors and patients cannot receive the medicines they need and thousands of health workers have left the country looking for better opportunities abroad.

But people need support and community in times of crisis. An international humanitarian worker who spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity because they're not authorized to speak to the media said Venezuelan migrants who had not built support networks in a new adopted country were the most likely to return home to Venezuela.

""If I have to starve, I want to starve in my own place, with my family,"" said Roque, the restaurant worker.

That urge for home appeared to have overridden any doubts about the risk of spreading the virus. Like Roque, some migrants waiting in Cucuta told CNN that they believed they had proven themselves healthy after surviving the long journey to get there. Others said simply that they had bigger challenges to overcome than the virus.

Nevertheless, to check the spread of the virus, most migrants seeking entry to Venezuela are given a color-coded bracelet by Colombian authorities when they arrive in Cucuta. Roque's was red.

Every day, a group wearing a different color bracelet is told to board buses, which take them to a coronavirus screening facility run by the Norte de Santander Department, where they isolate and can be tested for coronavirus if feeling unwell. Each migrant's temperature is tested several times a day; if anyone presents a fever, a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test is performed on them.

With no fever or a negative PCR test, they are allowed to cross the border, as long as Venezuelan authorities approve. This agreement between the two countries is informal; neither government recognizes the other and in theory, the border is closed.

The migrants then must isolate again once they get to Venezuela, for a minimum of 12 days before being allowed to travel home. The Maduro government has created isolation centers in towns close to the border, where migrants are required to stay.

Venezuela has so far registered far fewer cases than other countries in the region. However, international observers have questioned Venezuela's capacity to test for the virus, saying the real numbers of coronavirus infections could be much higher.

Only 350 Venezuelans are allowed to return to the country on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, for an official total of 1050 per week -- a number that reflects Venezuela's limited capacity to quarantine citizens upon arrival, the Venezuelan border authority told CNN. However, CNN has also witnessed migrants crossing the border on a Tuesday and Colombian authorities say that the border is sometimes re-opened at very short notice.

The Maduro government has said that citizens' rights to enter their own country is respected, and that the slow pace of admission is necessary to protect the rest of the Venezuelan population from the virus.

The future

On the Colombian side, authorities are already worried for when the hourglass will flip once more, and Venezuela's hardships will again force migrants to leave.

""If these people won't find in Venezuela some form of survival, they could well try to go back to the same places where they stayed for the last three years, like in a giant migratory swing where they spend some time in Venezuela and some other time abroad,"" Bautista, the Department's Secretary for Migration, told CNN.

For some, the swing has already begun: Adrian Lopez and his family of five are now walking back to Bogotá, where Adrian was working in the informal economy.

They had left the Colombian capital in March once the lockdown was imposed, and arrived in Cucuta at the beginning of April after a trek of 370 miles. But in the chaos of their arrival, they never managed to sign up for one of the color-coded groups to be tested for the virus. After two months in the migrant camp next to the border, they gave up on returning to Venezuela.

""I was starving there (at the camp),"" Adrian said. ""My son is three months old and being born here he is a Colombian citizen. They can't kick us out. At least in Bogotá, I know the place and I will try to find a job, somehow.""",2020-07-13,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/13/americas/latam-venezuela-migrants-cucata-intl/index.html

View of the building where Argentinian revolutionary legend Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara was born in Rosario, Argentina.

Situated 186 miles north of Buenos Aires in the city of Rosario, Argentina, the 2,150-square-foot apartment has been uninhabited since 2011, according to Agencia Télam.

Photos of Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara hang in the apartment he was born.

The home has had several owners and was intended to house various cultural projects before being put up for sale.

One of the current owners, businessman Francisco Farruggia, told CNN en Español that he was already planning to sell it, but with multiple properties in different countries, the Covid-19 pandemic accelerated his decision.

The owners point to the property's historical and architectural value as well as location. They told CNN en Español they already have some offers.

Chandler Thornton,Facebook removes fake accounts tied to Brazil's Bolsonaro and sons,"(CNN) Facebook has removed dozens of what it said are fake social media accounts linked to the offices of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and his sons. The accounts were used to target journalists and political opponents of the president, and also discussed the coronavirus.

In a statement Wednesday , Facebook's Head of Security Policy Nathaniel Gleicher said the company took down ""35 Facebook accounts, 14 Pages, 1 Group and 38 Instagram accounts that were involved in coordinated inauthentic behavior in Brazil.""

Gleicher wrote the people behind the accounts ""attempted to conceal their identities,"" but were discovered to be ""associated with the Social Liberal Party and some of the employees of the offices of Anderson Moraes, Alana Passos, Eduardo Bolsonaro , Flavio Bolsonaro and Jair Bolsonaro.""

The accounts reportedly posted about ""domestic politics and elections."" They also posted ""criticism of the political opposition, media organizations and journalists, and most recently they posted about the coronavirus pandemic,"" Facebook said, adding that one or more of the social media pages had more than 883,000 followers.

The social network removed the accounts not for their content, but for ""inauthentic"" activity that aimed ""to evade enforcement, create fictitious personas posing as reporters, post content, and manage Pages masquerading as news outlets.""

President Bolsonaro has not commented on the Facebook action. However, when asked about the accounts, his eldest son Flavio Bolsonaro told CNN that ""as far as we know, they are all free and independent.""

He also questioned ""whether or not the platform [Facebook] exceeded the limits of censorship"" in removing the accounts. ""Judgments that do not allow for contradiction and wide defense are not compatible with our democracy, they are weapons that can destroy reputations and lives,"" he said.

Separately, Flavio Bolsonaro tweeted , ""My solidarity to all the profiles that were unfairly censored by Facebook and Instagram - apparently for supporting President Bolsonaro. As soon as you create your new profiles to exercise the sacred freedom of expression, let me know in private and I will help spread the word.""

Civil rights groups have accused Facebook in the past of failing to stop the spread of misinformation and hate speech on its platform, and a group of US businesses is currently boycotting the social network over the same issue, vowing to halt advertising until at least the end of the month.",2020-07-09,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/09/americas/brazil-bolsonaro-facebook-fake-accounts-intl/index.html
Rodrigo Pedroso,Brazil coronavirus: Cases explode while country investigates corruption,"(CNN) As Brazil's coronavirus cases surge by the tens of thousands each day, the country is contending with a parallel outbreak -- a flurry of corruption investigations into the alleged misuse of public money rapidly shelled out for Covid-19 emergency procurement.

The investigations have reached all levels of government, including three state governors who have come under federal scrutiny in the past two months. Nearly 1,500 federal criminal judicial proceedings have also been opened into coronavirus-related cases, including investigations into misuse of federal funds, fraud, overpricing, and money laundering, according to a summary the federal prosecution office shared with CNN. The data provided to CNN does not specify what portion of the probes relate to corruption.

Meanwhile, cases of coronavirus are soaring across Brazil , and the healthcare system in several states has been stretched to its limit. Brazil is second only to the United States in the number of infections and deaths, and on Tuesday, bombastic president Jair Bolsonaro was also diagnosed with Covid-19.

State-level investigations

On the state level, investigations into Covid-19 emergency purchases have been reported in at least 11 of Brazil's 26 states and the federal district, according to the Federal Police. At least seven high-ranking state health officials have been fired or resigned during the pandemic.

Two health officials in Rio de Janeiro were arrested in a probe known as ""Operation Merchants of Chaos,"" into an alleged scheme to pilfer millions of dollars from a contract for ventilators that federal authorities say were never delivered.

In São Paulo, Brazil's most populous state and the epicenter of the country's coronavirus outbreak, a large purchase of imported ventilators is under investigation.

State prosecutors and an accountability court are reviewing a $100 million contract signed by the state government at the beginning of the pandemic for some 3,000 ventilators from China. Sao Paulo officials paid as much as $40,000 each for some ventilators, while the cheapest were bought for $20,000, according to the Brazilian Office of the Comptroller General, which notes that the average price per ventilator paid across Brazil is around $16,000.

The state government has said the purchases complied with legal requirements. But in June, the state canceled the contract after receiving only a small number of the ventilators. Attorneys for the São Paulo state government have filed a lawsuit against the middleman company seeking a refund and fines for the unfulfilled delivery. It was a highly publicized debacle for São Paulo's government, which is listed in the middle of a ranking published by Transparency International Brazil of states' transparency in Covid-19 emergency contracting.

Globally, the rush to obtain urgent medical supplies has led to hastily negotiated contracts and sometimes exorbitant prices. Spiking demand for medical equipment has also forced legitimate costs up as suppliers ramp up production and compete for raw materials.

Expeditious emergency contracting is useful in order to meet the need of the pandemic, acknowledges Guilherme France, research coordinator for Transparency International Brazil -- however, doing so ""also implies a loosening of controls that exist precisely in order to prevent corruption.""

He says that the frenzied circumstances of the pandemic have opened the door to abuses. ""In this moment of inflated prices and limited offer, opportunistic businesses arise to take advantage of these vulnerabilities and to increase profits in an unscrupulous way,"" he said.

Federal investigations across the country

On the federal level, probes into suspected misuse of federal funds have touched officials across the country, from a mayor and city officials in the remote northern Amapá to the governors of the Amazonian states of Pará and Amazonas and down to the southeastern beaches of Rio de Janeiro.

Federal agents searched the home of Amazonas Gov. Wilson Lima in late June as part of an investigation into an alleged no-bid contract for the purchase of ventilators by the state government from a wine importer in the capital Manaus. Lima has denied any wrongdoing. ""I am absolutely calm and am certain that these facts will soon be clarified,"" he said

In the state of Pará, federal agents searched the home of Gov. Helder Barbalho, who is suspected of involvement in a ventilator contract that delivered equipment with glaring technical defects, such as the lack of an internal battery which means it could shut off if power went out, flaws in the breathing cycle that could cause lung damage and problems with the machine's ability to be cleaned and sterilized.

Federal prosecutors allege that Barbalho was aware of the flaws in the equipment and had a close relationship with a businessman who brokered the sale. But the governor has denied any wrongdoing. ""I clarify that I am not a friend of the businessman [involved in the sale] and, obviously, I did not know that the ventilators would not work,"" Barbalho wrote on Twitter in early June.

In Rio de Janeiro, Gov. Wilson Witzel had his cell phones and computers seized by federal agents who entered his official residence on May 26 as part of a probe investigators dubbed ""Operation Placebo"" into alleged embezzlement of public health funds. Rio state lawmakers, responding to the federal investigation, have now launched an impeachment investigation of Witzel over Covid-19 procurement, including allegations of graft in a purchase of ventilators and a contract to build f ield hospitals. Witzel has denied any wrongdoing.

The investigations into the three governors are ongoing and no charges have been made against them.

However, the probes have already deprived Witzel's government of the high-ranking health officials who would have otherwise led Rio de Janeiro through its pandemic response. Fernando Ferry, Rio de Janeiro's health secretary for a matter of weeks, resigned his post in late June after three other top state health officials had lost or quit their jobs amid wrongdoing and corruption accusations during the pandemic. His resignation came a week after federal agents indicted 17 people in Rio de Janeiro, including a former state lawmaker, for alleged involvement in a scheme to misappropriate funds meant to be spent on medical equipment.

Ferry later testified to lawmakers on an oversight committee probing public health expenditures during the pandemic that he feared ""dirtying"" his personal record. He told Brazil's TV Record: ""In order to make the machine work, I would have to sign off on things without being covered by a contract. And this legal imbroglio would spill over to my CPF,"" a reference to a Brazilian identification number that tracks one's creditworthiness.

'You could have saved more lives and helped more people if resources were not diverted'

President Bolsonaro rose to power promising to clean up corruption and to change ""all that is there, "" as he frequently said on the campaign trail. But France, from Transparency International, says that Bolsonaro's performance before and during the pandemic is hardly fulfilling the anti-corruption rhetoric that drew voters.

""Now, after a year and a half of governing, the Bolsonaro administration is responsible for a series of setbacks in the fight against corruption,"" France said. Those setbacks include instances of blatant political interference in institutions responsible for fighting corruption, such as the Federal Police, the Federal Prosecution Office, and the Council for Financial Activities Control.

In April, Bolsonaro replaced Justice Minister Sergio Moro with an ally, André Mendonça, who in turn named a new head of the Federal Police. This comes as two of Bolsonaros sons are under investigation for alleged wrongdoing unrelated to the pandemic.

Christian Lynch, political scientist and professor at Rio de Janeiro State University, says local corruption scandals and investigations could prove beneficial to Bolsonaro politically, as he outsources the responsibility of handling the pandemic.

""The scandals that appeared in Rio de Janeiro and Pará, states whose governors were the opposition, were very useful because they associated the independence of their opponents from the federal government with corruption,"" he said.

The country's flurry of corruption investigations come amid crushing poverty and unemployment in the country, as the pandemic caps off years of economic decline . According to a new projection from the International Monetary Fund, Brazilian GDP is expected to shrink 9.1% this year.

For Micaella Melo de Paula, a respiratory physiotherapist in a Rio de Janeiro public hospital who intubates Covid-19 patients, the allegations of misused funds and backroom deals are an indignity. Employees at the hospital where she works went unpaid for more than a month during the pandemic, the Rio de Janeiro state health secretariat has confirmed to CNN. A probe is now underway in order to settle payments. Melo de Paula herself says she is owed more than a thousand dollars in unpaid wages from work during the pandemic.

""But it gives you a feeling of impotence and anger to know that you could have saved more lives and helped more people if resources were not diverted, if supplies were not overpriced,"" she said.

""The pandemic comes to expose all these dirty politics and its schemes -- and we are the ones who are the frontline suffering from their actions.""",2020-07-08,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/08/americas/brazil-coronavirus-corruption-intl/index.html
Julia Hollingsworth,One million foreign students risk being frozen out of US colleges. Some might never come back,"(CNN) In two months, 19-year-old Tianyu Fang is due to start his first semester at one of the most prestigious schools in America: Stanford University in California. Now, the Chinese national isn't sure if he'll make it.

Fang is one of the million or so international students who could be made to leave the United States if their universities switch to online-only learning, under a rule announced by Washington on Monday . Those who don't leave voluntarily face deportation.

Some universities have announced they will deliver all courses online due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has infected more than 2.9 million people and killed more than 130,000 in the US alone . Other universities are still planning to run classes on campus, but with the US outbreak still not under control, there's a risk that those institutions could go remote, too.

More than half of international students in the US come from Asia. In the 2018-2019 academic year, 370,000 students were from China, 202,000 from India, and 52,000 from South Korea.

For Fang, who has studied in the US since middle school but returned to Beijing earlier this year, Monday's announcement exacerbates an already complicated situation. To get around the US ban on travelers who have been in China in the past two weeks, he planned to fly from China to Cambodia. After 14 days, he would hopefully fly to the US.

Now, things are even harder. Currently, Stanford plans to stagger which students are on campus each semester to maintain social distancing. First year students will be on campus in the fall and summer terms -- meaning Fang will be studying remotely in one semester and will have to leave the US for that period.

Even that will be challenging. There are few flights between the US and China, where international arrivals have to quarantine for two weeks.

Now, Fang is weighing up whether he wants to pay about $60,000 a year to study remotely from China. If he does, he won't have all the unplanned interactions and conversations that usually come with a school experience.

Tianyu Fang in Boston's Chinatown. Fang completed his high school in the Boston area.

Living with uncertainty

For now, 29-year-old Chinese national Chen Na isn't affected by Monday's changes.

At New York University (NYU), where Chen is halfway through a two-year master's degree, her courses will be a combination of online and offline when fall semester starts.

But there's a chance that NYU could go back to online-only classes, as it did in March.

""I can't stop thinking about it,"" she said. ""I just feel kind of powerless and vulnerable. I will try my best to stay here legally.""

If courses go online-only, transferring to another university won't be an option -- few other schools offer the Interactive Telecommunications Program Chen is studying.

Instead, she would have to try to go back to China, which would be expensive.

When Chen first heard the rule change, she felt desensitized as there have been a number of other policies that make things more difficult for international students.

In May, for instance, New York Times and Reuters reported that the US was planning to cancel the visas of thousands of Chinese graduate students and researchers with ties to universities affiliated with the People's Liberation Army. In April, Republican Senator Tom Cotton suggested Chinese students at US universities shouldn't be allowed to study science and technology. The Trump administration has also made a litany of changes to the US immigration system , citing the coronavirus pandemic, which have resulted in barring swaths of immigrants from coming to the country.

""We don't have much power here, and then sometimes we become the sacrifice for all these political games,"" Chen said. ""I'm really aware of my foreign status here, I know I'm a foreigner. I don't necessarily see an increasing hostility from other people, but I do feel like policy-wise, it's crushing us.""

The difficulty in getting home

It may be harder for some students to get home than others.

Theresa Cardinal Brown, director of immigration and cross-border policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center, says some student might not be able to home might at all.

""The bigger issue is some of these countries have travel restrictions on and they can't go home, so what do they do then?"" she added. ""It's a conundrum for a lot of students.""

India, the US' second-biggest source of international students, has closed its borders to commercial flights, although it is still running repatriation flights

Maitri Parsana, who has just finished her third year of biological sciences at the University of Buffalo in New York state, doesn't know how she would get back to India if she was forced to leave.

Maitri Parsana in the United States, where she has studied at the University of Buffalo for three years.

Her university has said it will offer hybrid courses, but the 22-year-old fromo Gujarat state, still doesn't know whether her specific classes will be online or offline.

Parsana says there are no flights to India, but she hopes her government would arrange flights to get stranded students back home.

""I am definitely scared, I really don't know what to do. I was already stressed about my school and now i have to stress about one more thing,"" she said, adding that the US appears to be focusing on international students rather than addressing real problems, such as the pandemic.

""We just feel like we're being pushed away from this country for no reason.""

Business impacts

It's not just students who may be hurt by Monday's decision. It could impact the US economy, too.

In 2018, students from China, India and South Korea alone contributed more than $25 billion to the economy, according to non-profit Institute of International Education.

If students are forced to leave the country, they may not be willing to continue paying tuition fees to study remotely from a different time zone.

Nicholas Henderson, the co-founder and director of Essai Education, a Delhi based test-prep and counseling institute for Indian students wanting to study in the US, said that the regulations may prompt colleges to change their policies to hybrid models, for instance, to help people stay.

""I think what Covid has shown is that universities are willing to work with the students,"" he said.

But even so, there's the risk that the US' policies may discourage future students from choosing to study in the US.

When Parsana first came to the US, she planned to try to settle there. Now, she says she doesn't want to live in the US, and would encourage students looking to study abroad to consider another country, like Australia or Canada.

""I don't know what (the US government is) trying to do because their economy is going to go to ashes if they do this,"" Parsana said. ""If they keep on doing these kinds of rules, not a lot of people are going to come here for their education.""

Career impacts

If international students are sent home early, it's not just their education that will be impacted. Students could end up missing out on job opportunities -- often one of the reasons they might have chosen to study in the US in the first place.

In the US, international students qualify for a scheme that allows them to work in the country after they graduate.

A 24-year-old South Korean university student says he feels ""disappointed"" that, due to Monday's policy change, he may miss out on that scheme. CNN agreed not to use his real name because of his concerns for privacy.

He only has one semester of his degree to go, and when he signed up for his courses, they were all offline. Now, they have changed to online courses, and it seems like he will either have to go home or transfer to another university for his final semester.

""I have no idea what's going on,"" he said. ""I just renewed my house contract.""

If he goes home, he won't qualify for the temporary employment scheme -- and if he wants to work in the US, he'll likely need to find a company to sponsor his visa.

""I'm so frustrated,"" he said. ""I just want to get some opportunities at least to compete.""

Chen is faced with a similar situation. Before the pandemic, she planned to stay in the US and find a job after graduating in 2021. But now, Chen is weighing up whether the US is the best place to be, after all.

Devan Cole,"New York Times: Trump considered selling Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria, former acting Homeland Security chief says","Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump considered the idea of selling Puerto Rico in 2017 after the island was devastated by Hurricane Maria, the former acting Homeland Security secretary told The New York Times in an interview published Friday.

""The President's initial ideas were more of as a businessman, you know,"" Elaine Duke, who was serving as DHS' acting secretary when the hurricane hit the island in September 2017, told the Times.

""'Can we outsource the electricity? Can we can we sell the island? You know, or divest of that asset?'"" Trump reportedly said, according to Duke in the newspaper interview. ""(She said the idea of selling Puerto Rico was never seriously considered or discussed after Mr. Trump raised it.),"" the paper reported.

Trump has previously taken aim at Puerto Rican officials for their management of the billions in relief funds his administration has appropriated for storm recovery, accusing the island's leaders of spending some of that money for reasons other than hurricane clean-up. In November 2018, White House officials told congressional leaders and appropriators that the President did not want any additional relief funding sent to the island.

Madeline Holcombe,Working from home can soon mean working in Barbados for up to a year,"(CNN) — Those working remotely in the Covid-19 pandemic may soon be able to move the home office to Barbados, according to the Barbados Government Information Service.

Prime Minister Mia Amor Mottley announced at the reopening of a bar that the government will soon introduce a 12-month Barbados Welcome Stamp for visitors working remotely , the government information service said earlier this month.

Rapid testing is not readily available for the country in the coronavirus pandemic, which has made short-term travel to Barbados more difficult, Mottley said. The year-long invitation is Barbados' answer to the economic difficulties travel companies and tourist destinations are facing as people all over the world are encouraged to stay home and mitigate the virus' spread.

Mottley hopes industries across the country will become involved in welcoming longer-term travelers.

""You don't need to work in Europe, or the US or Latin America if you can come here and work for a couple months at a time; go back and come back,"" Mottley said. ""But in order for those things to truly resonate, what does it mean? It means that what we offer has to be world-class and what we continue to offer is world-class.""

Though slowly and cautiously, some Caribbean Islands have begun reopening their borders for international visitors this month.

Analysis Julia Horowitz,Could the United Kingdom become an emerging market?,"London (CNN Business) Brexit and the coronavirus pandemic are reshaping the UK economy . Could it end up looking more like Turkey, Mexico and Argentina than France, Germany and the United States ?

Some analysts on Wall Street are beginning to wonder whether a volatile currency, declining global clout and a reliance on foreign investors could relegate the United Kingdom to ""emerging market"" status.

Bank of America suggested in a recent note to clients that it may be time to treat the British pound as an emerging market currency, citing Brexit and worsening debt dynamics as a result of Covid-19.

""We believe [the pound] is in the process of evolving into a currency that resembles the underlying reality of the British economy: small and shrinking,"" wrote BofA strategists Kamal Sharma and Myria Kyriacou.

There are reasons the demotion to emerging market status seems like a stretch. The pound is heavily traded, investors have maintained their faith in British institutions and there's high demand for debt issued by the country's government.

But what the comparisons make clear is that investors are bracing for a world in which the United Kingdom's standing is diminished.

""We don't think there's any risk that the UK is suddenly going to be viewed as an emerging market,"" said Thomas Pugh, UK economist at the research firm Capital Economics. But Brexit and the country's response to the pandemic, he said, ""will weigh on confidence.""

A sagging United Kingdom

The United Kingdom, which has one of the highest per capita Covid-19 death rates in the world, is battling a deep recession as a result of lockdowns aimed at containing the virus.

The Bank of England estimates the UK economy could shrink by 14% this year, its worst downturn in more than 300 years . The country also has fewer than six months to hammer out a new trade deal with the European Union, its biggest export market.

The pound has become extremely volatile amid uncertainty about the United Kingdom's path forward. It's now trading at $1.26, down more than 15% since the 2016 Brexit referendum.

Bank of America's Sharma and Kyriacou described its fluctuations as ""neurotic at best, unfathomable at worst."" The only currency that investors see as more unstable is the Brazilian real, they noted.

Brexit, they added, isn't helping. The country's departure from the European Union ""is likely to permanently alter the way in which investors view the pound,"" Sharma and Kyriacou said.

Investors also have to stomach concerns about Britain living beyond its means.

For years, Britain has carried a sizable current account deficit, which means it spends more on goods, services and investments abroad than it brings in at home. That's now coupled with a worsening fiscal deficit as the country borrows huge amounts to finance its pandemic recovery plans. As of May, Britain's debt was bigger than the size of the entire economy for the first time since 1963

A pedestrian walks a dog along a street in Manchester on July 7.

This week, finance minister Rishi Sunak unveiled another £30 billion ($37.8 billion) coronavirus stimulus package aimed at stemming a growing jobs crisis. The Institute for Fiscal Studies, an economic think tank, predicted that the latest measures would likely push this year's deficit further north of £300 billion ($378 billion), which it said would be ""easily"" the highest as a share of national income since World War II.

These dynamics make Britain vulnerable to a rise in interest rates. Rates are extremely low right now and expected to stay that way for a long time. But a spike in inflation could change that calculus.

Per Sharma and Kyriacou, Britain's so-called ""dual deficit"" — its current account deficit and its fiscal deficit taken together — will be wider next year than that of Mexico and Turkey, as well as the G20 average.

Emerging market Britain?

The United Kingdom is still the sixth largest economy in the world. On most counts, it falls squarely into the ""developed market"" camp.

The British pound makes up 4.4% of the world's currency reserves, according to data from the International Monetary Fund, suggesting that foreign central banks consider it a safe bet.

Investors also place a lot of trust in the country's institutions, including the Bank of England, which was founded more than 325 years ago. The central bank has moved swiftly during the current crisis, dropping interest rates and ramping up its bond-buying program

Those bond purchases are allowing the UK government to finance its recovery efforts as it borrows record amounts, while supporting demand for UK government bonds, known as gilts.

The yield on the benchmark 10-year bond is 0.14%, reflecting its status as a safe haven. The yield on Mexico's 10-year bond, for comparison, is 5.76%, while Turkey's is 12.43%, indicating a much higher risk premium.

""There doesn't seem to be any ... unwillingness to buy and hold UK debt,"" UBS economist Dean Turner said. Should demand falter, there's an expectation that the Bank of England would quickly step in.

Still, there is a growing view that the country's stature in global markets could be under threat over the longer term.

Britain's budget watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, said in March — before the country entered lockdown — that it expected economic output to be about 4% lower over the next 15 years than it would have been without Brexit, even if the United Kingdom and the European Union reach a ""typical"" free trade agreement.

And Britain is not impervious to an emerging market-style currency crisis, if history is any guide.

In 1976, the country — battling a run on the pound triggered by recession and concern about high levels of public spending — was forced to appeal for a nearly $4 billion IMF loan.

""You only have to go [back] to the '70s when there was last real currency crisis,"" Pugh said. ""It's certainly not unheard of.""",2020-07-10,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/10/business/uk-emerging-market/index.html
Hanna Ziady,The UK is reopening for business. London may never be the same,"London has seen more than its share of crises. The 2000-year old metropolis has endured an influenza pandemic, the Blitz and several financial meltdowns over just the past century.

Time and again, London has come roaring back, relying on a spirit of resilience and reinvention that is being summoned once more as the British capital seeks to recover from what may be this century's greatest upheaval: the coronavirus pandemic.

The spread of the virus and efforts to contain it turned one of the world's liveliest urban meccas into a virtual ghost town, driving millions of people out of the city's center and its financial district, and bringing commerce to a sudden halt.

Spectators at the New Year's Day Parade. Over 10,000 performers paraded from Piccadilly Circus to Parliament Square.

The scale of the shutdown would have been unimaginable just six months ago, when around 500,000 people poured into the area around Piccadilly Circus for the annual New Year's Day Parade and it was common to wait 90 minutes for a table at the busiest restaurants.

Then the pandemic hit. Virtually overnight, shops closed, tourists fled, offices and streets emptied out and the city's 9 million residents holed up at home. Nowhere was the standstill captured more acutely than in the mainstay of London city life: the Tube.

Underground journeys for the month of March tumbled 43% from the 106 million recorded in February, and plunged even further in April, during the height of lockdown, to just 5.7 million. Social distancing rules mean the Tube can only handle up to 15% of its normal traffic, according to London's mayor, Sadiq Khan.

The fallout from lockdown has been severe. London's economy is expected to contract nearly 17% this year, according to figures from the city government, a sharper drop than the 14% decline the Bank of England expects for the United Kingdom as a whole.

Companies in London are expected to shed some 460,000 jobs, or about 7% of the workforce, with manufacturing, construction, retail, and accommodation and food services the hardest hit. Employment is not expected to fully recover until 2022.

With transportation severely constrained, and a potential coronavirus vaccine still many months away, the people and companies that have made London into a hub for real estate, finance, the arts, hospitality and technology are desperately trying to reinvent themselves in hopes of surviving the pandemic.

One sign of progress: pubs, restaurants and hair salons can reopen on Saturday, provided they follow social distancing guidelines.

The physical city

What the pandemic means for London's sprawling collection of corporate headquarters is still unclear. Paul Cheshire, professor of economic geography at the London School of Economics, is quick to dismiss the suggestion that the office is dead as ""nonsense,"" arguing that what happens in the long term will be less dramatic.

More people will spend more time working from home, or in decentralized office spaces, but this won't abolish companies' demand for locations in the city center, which have been shown to increase productivity and facilitate idea sharing, he said.

Commuters walk across London Bridge on February 3, 2020. The city went into lockdown on March 24.

What happens to real estate, which accounts for 15% of London's economy, matters a great deal to the city.

The government has protected commercial tenants from eviction through August, but those measures will at some point expire. According to property management platform, Re-Leased, just 45% of commercial rents for the third quarter had been paid by early July. But that was an improvement on the previous three months and ""a sign of the capital's resilience,"" said Re-Leased CEO, Tom Wallace.

The pandemic has accelerated existing trends around agile working and the desire for more flexible office space, where several different companies share meeting and social areas, as well as facilities such as showers, bike racks and kitchens.

Companies ""want their offices to count,"" said Darren Richards, head of real estate at British Land, a leading UK property company. He predicts that greater numbers of older offices in need of refurbishment will likely be released onto the market in the future, as companies prioritize higher quality spaces.

British Land owns 22.8 million square feet of commercial real estate, including 7.1 million square feet of offices in areas like Broadgate, Paddington, Mayfair and Regent's Place. It said that its tenants are currently not seeking to get rid of office space. Businesses still ""want space fundamentally,"" though they are contemplating how much and for what purpose, Richards said.

Still, the penetration of online shopping during the coronavirus will mean a reduction in brick-and-mortar outlets, which could radically alter the landscape of London's vast retail space and create yet more uncertainty for the city's real estate market. ""What would have happened over five years is happening over months,"" said Richards.

The City, reinvented

London's financial heart, referred to as the City of London, has a proven track record of reinvention.

Storied institutions like Lloyd's of London, the Bank of England and the London Stock Exchange have been around for centuries, withstanding radical social, political and economic turmoil

Today, the City is home to well over 250 international banks and handles 43% of global foreign exchange trading, according to the Bank for International Settlements. Financial services contributed £65 billion ($81 billion) to the London economy in 2018, or about 15%, figures from City Hall show.

And despite four years of uncertainty over Brexit, the United Kingdom has been Europe's top location for international financial services investment over the past two decades, with London claiming the bulk of those flows.

People observe social distancing as they look out at the skyline of London's financial district on June 9.

""London's dominance as the preeminent European financial center remains unrivaled,"" said Omar Ali, EY's UK financial services managing partner.

UK financial services will continue to be a leading recipient of overseas investment even after the pandemic, according to an EY survey conducted in April.

Investors ranked the availability of capital as the most important consideration influencing their future location choices, followed by safety and security measures introduced to prevent a future major crisis, whether that relates to health, the environment or cyber security.

London's dominance as the preeminent European financial center remains unrivaled."" Omar Ali, EY

There are factors working against the City, however. The UK government's handling of the coronavirus crisis has been widely criticized, and business and consumer confidence remains depressed.

""We failed to take advantage of the fact that we're an island and didn't move fast enough. There was a lot of complacency and hubris,"" said Richard Burge, the CEO of the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

The government's approach to negotiating its post-Brexit trading relationship with the European Union has also drawn reproach. A group of business leaders warned this week that Britain's decision not to extend the current transition period beyond the end of the year is a "" huge gamble .""

The City of London may yet be tested. Crucially, there is currently no guarantee that UK financial firms will retain access to the European Union after this year — an export market worth £26 billion ($32.4 billion) in 2018, according to the Office for National Statistics, or 40% of the sector's total value.

Still good for startups

As London seeks to retain its status as a leading global business center, the city's technology sector, which boomed following the global financial crisis, could help.

Google, GOOGL Facebook FB Amazon AMZN andhave big offices in London, and startup investment has continued during the pandemic, suggesting that losses in real estate and financial services could be made up in the tech sector. Startups based in London have raised $4 billion in venture capital since the start of the year, more than Paris, Stockholm, Berlin and Tel Aviv combined, according to figures compiled in June by Tech Nation and Dealroom.

""It's a global arms race but London is still ahead,"" said Brent Hoberman, the co-founder of Founders Factory, an accelerator. ""I think London absolutely remains as the global magnet for tech talent,"" he added, attributing its attractiveness to world class educational institutions, diverse culture and early entrepreneur success stories.

Lockdowns have only accelerated the adoption of digital technologies in everyday life, and boosted information and health technology companies, playing to London's strengths, said Suranga Chandratillake, a partner at Balderton Capital, one of Europe's leading early stage venture capital investors with stakes in companies such as Citymapper, Vivino, Lyst and Revolut.

London absolutely remains the global magnet for tech talent."" Brent Hoberman, Founders Factory

The city is home to a large share of digital consumer businesses, Chandratillake said, including online grocer Ocado, digital banks such as Revolut and Monzo, and food delivery companies such as Deliveroo and Gousto.

London also boasts an outsized share of technology companies in areas such as cyber security and workforce management, now servicing armies of home workers. And the coronavirus has boosted investment into health technology, benefiting London and the United Kingdom more broadly.

""The city is the most genetically diverse in the world, almost all citizens use the same health system and there are a variety of tech projects, both government-funded within the NHS [National Health Service] and privately-funded startups, that have grown rapidly against this backdrop and stand in a very strong position,"" Chandratillake told CNN Business.

Zoom ZM The pandemic could even help to catalyze new ways of doing business. London & Partners, the trade and investment body for London, said it recently organized a trade mission via, where a group of human resources tech entrepreneurs pitched their businesses to potential investors and customers in New York.

""If we assume a reduction in travel, it points towards naturally digital sectors in which London has existing strengths,"" said managing director of strategy and corporate affairs, Allen Simpson.

Saving London's culture

While London's tech and finance sectors look set to weather the current crisis, social distancing and a reduction in travel spells disaster for its once booming arts and culture scene, which helps attract tourists, ambitious young professionals and investment. For theaters, museums, restaurants and bars, it's an existential threat.

Leisure and hospitality ""really strategically matter,"" said Simpson. ""People come from all over the world partly because London is a cool place to live.""

Nearly 40% of Londoners are born outside the United Kingdom, making London one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the world. It is home to 1 million EU nationals and was the world's third most visited city in 2018, narrowly behind Paris and Bangkok, according to Mastercard.

Last year, London boasted 21.7 million overseas visitors who spent £15.7 billion ($19.6 billion) on the local economy and supported 250,000 jobs, according to the Office for National Statistics.

""That revenue keeps certain things alive in London,"" said UK Tourism Alliance director Kurt Janson. ""The West End theaters couldn't survive if not for overseas visitors.""

London's West End theater district on a Saturday evening in April.

In an open letter to the government signed by UK Theatre and nearly 100 actors, writers and directors, the Society of London Theatre worried that ""British theatre is on the brink of ruin.""

""Theatres do not have the money to operate viably with physical distancing,"" they said. The industry has called for an emergency relief fund, ongoing wage support and more help for freelancers and self-employed artists.

Museums, galleries and London's iconic tourist attractions are also at risk. Several have not yet announced plans to reopen, despite being allowed to do so on Saturday. In a joint statement issued late last month, directors of museums such as the Tate, British Museum and National Gallery said it was a question of ""how and when we can open our doors again in a financially sustainable manner, for the long term.""

The National Gallery has said it will reopen on July 8, while the Tate Britain and Tate Modern will reopen on July 27 and the Tower of London on July 10.

On Sunday, the government announced a £1.57 billion ($1.96 billion) rescue package, mostly in the form of grants, to ""provide a lifeline"" to the arts and culture sector. Details of how the bailout will be distributed still need to be ironed out, but it was welcomed by industry leaders. ""This is a vital next step on the road to recovery for the industry and will help to support and sustain the UK's vibrant arts ecology through this crisis,"" Alex Beard, CEO of the Royal Opera House, said in a statement.

London's pubs and restaurants face an even greater threat from social distancing.

Already, Michelin-starred Texture and the upmarket Indian Accent, a Mayfair outpost of the Delhi original, have permanently closed. They are unlikely to be the only casualties.

Murat Kilic, the owner of Amber, in the hip East Aldgate neighborhood, told CNN Business that he is not confident about reopening. Amber is opening its doors on Saturday for the first time in nearly four months, but at less than half its previous capacity.

Kilic worries that when government support is wound down in October, he could risk eviction unless his landlord agrees to temporarily reduce monthly rent payments.

For Joseph Ryan, business looks set to boom over the July 4 weekend at his two pubs in London. Howl at the Moon and The White Hart have far more bookings than usual, Ryan said, but he is less optimistic about the longer term outlook.

Indoor capacity has been cut in half, seating is now mandatory, wooden panels have been erected between tables, and staff will be wearing masks and gloves.

""We're confident about this weekend, but thereafter we're not so sure,"" said Ryan. ""The novelty might wear off.""

The shopping and entertainment hub, Covent Garden, on July 1, 2020.

Whether Londoners are quick to return to bars and eateries remains to be seen. Worryingly, household income and expenditure are set to tumble by 5.5% and 12% respectively this year, and are not expected to reach 2019 levels before at least 2023, according to City Hall.

How quickly a new London emerges depends on the coronavirus: if cases continue to fall and social distancing is eased further, the economic outlook will brighten. A second wave could prompt further lockdowns and all the economic pain that brings.

London will find ""workarounds"" to the immediate challenges posed by the virus, said Burge of the London Chamber, from becoming a city of cyclists and walkers to standing outside bars in the drizzle. ""That's what we do,"" he said. ""London will come through.""

Tamara Hardingham-Gill,Which international destinations are reopening to tourists?,"(CNN) — Although many governments are still advising against ""nonessential"" international travel , a host of popular destinations are beginning to ease their Covid-19 lockdown measures and border restrictions and are moving toward welcoming tourists back.

On July 1, the European Union announced it would be reopening its external border to 15 countries outside of the bloc in a bid to boost its travel industry.

Algeria, Australia, Canada, Georgia, Japan, Montenegro, Morocco, New Zealand, Rwanda, Serbia, South Korea, Thailand, Tunisia and Uruguay are all included in the list, along with China, provided it agrees to lift restrictions on EU citizens.

However, the United States, which now has the highest number of confirmed Covid-19 infections in the world, according to Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center, was not included.

""Travel bubbles"" are also becoming more popular, with the likes of Fiji, Australia and New Zealand considering following the lead of Baltic states Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, who have lifted restrictions for each other's citizens.

Meanwhile the UK has formed ""travel corridors"" with 59 different countries, while popular destinations like Dubai and Jamaica have already opened their doors to foreign visitors again.

If you're one of many travelers eagerly awaiting news on where you can travel to this year, here's a guide to the top destinations making plans to reopen, as well as some of those that are keeping their borders firmly closed for now.

Aruba

Aruba will slowly reopen to tourists between June 15 and July 10.

Visitors from nearby Caribbean islands Curacao and Bonaire will be permitted to enter first, followed by travelers from Canada and Europe on July 1.

Tourists from the United States will be allowed to visit from July 10.

While it was previously suggested travelers would not be required to to take a Covid-19 test on arrival or prior to traveling, it seems this is no longer the case.

Like many other destinations, Aruba is giving visitors the option to either provide a negative test result taken no more than 72 hours before their visit, or receive a test on arrival.

However, the cost of the test, which must be paid for in advance, is the responsibility of the traveler.

The island has also introduced mandatory insurance coverage, the Aruba Visitors Insurance , which will cover any expenses if visitors test positive for the virus during their trip.

Nonessential businesses including shopping malls, cinemas, beauty salons and outdoor restaurants were allowed to reopen on May 25, while the island country's 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew was completely lifted earlier this month.

Restaurants with indoor seating have now been allowed to reopen, although diners must leave before 10 p.m., along with spas, and saunas.

In addition, the department of Public Health has introduced the ""Aruba Health & Happiness Code,"" a mandatory cleaning and hygiene certification program for all businesses related to tourism in the country.

Bali

Bali has been relatively successful in containing its coronavirus outbreak, with less than 1,500 confirmed cases and, at the time of writing, a total of 11 deaths.

The Indonesian island now hopes to welcome tourists back by October, provided its infection rates stay low.

According to a statement from Ni Wayan Giri Adnyani , secretary of the ministry, Yogyakarta, situated on the island of Java, is likely to reopen first, along with the Riau islands province.

Bali's economy is hugely dependent on tourism and visitor numbers have been rising in recent years, with around 6.3 million people visiting in 2019.

""The coronavirus has collapsed the Balinese economy ... it's been a steep drop since [mid-March] when social-distancing measures were put in place,"" Mangku Nyoman Kandia, a Bali tour guide , told ABC News in April. ""No tourist, no money.""

All foreign nationals, except for diplomats, permanent residents and humanitarian workers, are currently banned from Indonesia, and anyone entering the island must undergo a swab test and provide a letter stating they are free of Covid-19.

It's unclear what the entry requirements will be if restrictions are lifted later this year, or whether Bali will accept travelers from regions badly affected by the pandemic.

However, tourism officials have been calling for a ""travel bubble"" to be implemented between Bali and Australia.

Barbados

Barbados has announced it will be reopening its borders to international travelers from July 12.

However, visitors will have to adhere to a number of strict requirements.

All tourists from ""high risk"" countries will be ""strongly encouraged"" to take a Covid-19 test at least 72 hours before departing for Barbados, according to a recent press release from the Barbados Tourist Board.

Meanwhile, those from ""low risk"" destinations can be tested a week before visiting the Caribbean island.

Visitors also need to complete an online Embarkation/Disembarkation Card (ED card), which asks a series of health questions connected to Covid-19 symptoms.

Those who don't provide a negative test result ""from an accredited or recognized laboratory"" in advance will must take one on arrival, and will be placed in quarantine ""at their own expense"" until the results come through. This is likely to take up to 48 hours.

While visiting the island, travelers must comply with local protocols, including keeping a physical distance of one-meter away from others and wearing face masks in public.

Barbados' nationwide curfew is due to be lifted on July 1 , while commercial air traffic will resume 11 days later.

UK flag carrier British Airways will restart services to Barbados on July 18, with US airline JetBlue following suit on July 25 and Virgin Atlantic on August 1.

Bermuda

Bermuda reopened its borders to international visitors on July 1, with the first commercial flight from the US arriving in the oldest self-governing British Overseas Territory on July 6.

However, travelers must take a Covid-19 test no more than five days before traveling to Bermuda and obtain a negative result, as well as complete the Bermuda travel authorization process online at least 48 hours prior to their visit.

Once they arrive, visitors must adhere to the nightly curfew, which runs from midnight to 5 .a.m, take their own temperatures twice a day and report the results via an online application.

In addition, travelers are required to take further tests at pop-up testing centers throughout the course of their trip.

""At a time when international travel is limited for many Americans, the island is a beautiful, close and comfortable option for those in need of an unforgettable escape,"" Victoria Isley, Chief Sales & Marketing Officer for the Bermuda Tourism Authority, said in a statement.

""Bermuda offers guests an accessible, safe destination with wide open spaces and pink sand beaches, clean ocean breezes and brilliant turquoise waters, plus meaningful cultural connections and fresh island fare.""

Croatia

Tourism accounts for 20% of Croatia's GDP, so officials are understandably keen to rejuvenate its travel sector.

Earlier this month, the Croatian Ministry of Interior announced the popular European destination is reopening to international tourists.

And while US citizens were recently left off a list of those permitted to travel into EU countries, Croatia has gone against this by choosing to welcome Americans back.

According to a statement on the official website for the US Embassy in Zagreb , EU nationals and ""all other foreign nationals, including US citizens, may enter Croatia for business, tourism, or other pressing personal reasons if they provide relevant proof.""

All foreign visitors must be able to supply evidence of a negative coronavirus test taken no longer than 48 hours before their arrival.

Those who fail to produce this will be required to self isolate for 14 days.

In addition, on entering the country, travelers are required to follow the advice stipulated in the ""Pamphlet with Recommendations and Instructions from the Croatian Institute of Public Health,"" for two weeks.

Cyprus

Cyprus is so keen to get its tourism industry back on track, officials are offering to cover the costs of any travelers who test positive for Covid-19 while on vacation in the Mediterranean island nation.

According to a letter shared with CNN, the Cypriot government will pay for lodging, as well as food, drink and medication for tourists who are taken ill with coronavirus during their visit.

The detailed plan was set out in a five-page letter issued to governments, airlines and tour operators on May 26.

Officials have also earmarked a 100-bed hospital for foreign travelers who test positive, while a 500-room ""quarantine hotel"" will be available to patients' family and ""close contacts.""

""The traveler will only need to bear the cost of their airport transfer and repatriation flight, in collaboration with their agent and/or airline,"" states the letter.

The country's hotels began to reopen on June 1, while international air travel restarted on June 9.

Once the destination reopens, visitors from only chosen countries will be allowed to enter.

Officials have issued a list of countries to be granted access to Cyprus in two separate stages.

Incoming flights from Greece, Malta, Bulgaria, Norway, Austria, Finland, Slovenia, Hungary, Israel, Denmark, Germany, Slovakia and Lithuania will be authorized first.

From June 20, Cyprus will also permit incoming flights from Switzerland, Poland, Romania, Croatia, Estonia and the Czech Republic.

The UK and the US, both listed among the nations with the highest number of confirmed Covid-19 deaths, are noticeably absent.

However, the list is to be expanded to include further countries in the coming months.

Travelers heading to Cyprus will need to provide a valid certificate proving they've tested negative for Covid-19, while they'll be subject to temperature checks on arrival as well as testing at random during the course of their trip.

The destination has already put measures in place to protect travelers and residents, such as ensuring hotel staff wear masks and gloves, regularly disinfecting sunbeds and keeping tables at restaurants, bars, cafés,and pubs at least two meters (6.5 feet) apart.

Tourism brings in around $1 billion in revenue for Egypt each month, so the impact of the travel restrictions caused by the pandemic has been significant.

The government suspended passenger flights back in March, while all hotels, restaurants and cafes were closed and a night curfew imposed.

These measures are currently being relaxed, with hotels that meet certain requirements, such as having a clinic with a resident doctor on site, being granted permission to reopen for domestic visitors at a reduced capacity.

Although international flights are yet to begin operating again -- bar a select few routes -- the cabinet has indicated scheduled international flights will be allowed to enter from July 1 , while foreign tourists will be permitted at the resorts least affected by Covid-19.

""A number of global carriers have expressed willingness to resume flights to Egypt in July, and as a result we are considering a gradual resumption of international flights beginning towards the end of this month and in the first half of July.""

France

France was the most visited country in the world before the coronavirus pandemic.

While restrictions were previously in place on all nonessential travel from outside the Schengen Zone (a grouping of 26 countries which normally have open borders), the measures are due to be lifted for 15 countries outside of the EU, including Australia, Canada and Japan.

At present all travelers who enter France, with the exception of EU citizens, are subject to a compulsory 14-day quarantine.

UK citizens were previously exempt from this measure. However, this was recently amended in response to the UK's decision to apply its mandatory 14-day quarantine, which is set to be amended soon , to arrivals from France.

Although the government has been slowly lifting lockdown measures, with car journeys of up to 100 kilometers now allowed and beaches beginning to reopen, officials have previously made it clear the country is in no hurry to ease border restrictions for international travelers..

Prime Minister Edouard Philippe recently announced a $19.4 billion stimulus package to boost France's ailing tourism sector.

""What is good for tourism is often good for France, what strikes tourism strikes France,"" he said during a news conference.

The country's hotels, bars, restaurants and cafés were granted permission to reopen on June 2.

Meanwhile Paris was downgraded from a ""red zone"" to a ""green zone"" in mid-June and the city has now reopened.

France's most visited museum, the Louvre, will reopen on July 6.

""Tourism is facing what is probably its worst challenge in modern history,"" added Philippe. ""Because this is one of the crown jewels of the French economy, rescuing it is a national priority.""

He went on to state that residents can take holidays within France during July and August.

The country's hotels will be reliant on domestic tourism once they do reopen, as all signs suggest international travelers will not be able to enter for the foreseeable future.

""When the lockdown measures soften, French tourists are likely to want to stay close to home in the short term,"" a spokesperson for French hotel chain Accor told CNN Travel earlier this month.

""It will be the moment for them to rediscover their own country and we will be there to welcome them.""

Georgia

Georgia was experiencing a tourism boom before the coronavirus pandemic, with five million travelers visiting in 2019, a 7% increase on the previous year.

But the country was forced to close its winter resorts and place a ban on all foreign visitors back in March because of the crisis.

Eager to revive its tourism sector, the country's government had previously said it planned to reopen to international travelers on July 1, but this has been pushed back until July 31 due to a ""rapid increase in the number of new coronavirus cases in the partner and neighboring countries.""

Officials have brought in a three-stage ""anti-crisis"" plan , which includes a marketing campaign designed to promote Georgia as a ""safe destination.""

The next stage will allow for domestic travel in special ""safe"" tourism zones, while the final stage involves reopening borders and resuming some flights.

""We are transitioning to the third stage [of Covid-19 response], which means post-crisis management of the economy and devising plans [on] how to kickstart different sectors,"" Prime Minister Giorgi Gakharia said at a council meeting focused on fighting Covid-19.

""[The] tourism sector will be first to which emergency relief measures will apply.""

Germany

The land of poets and thinkers lifted travel restrictions for travelers from 31 different countries on June 15.

The approved destinations included the 26 EU member states, as well as the UK, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland.

""The revitalization of tourism is important both for travelers and the German travel industry, as well as for the economic stability of the respective target countries,"" read a statement from a paper called ""Criteria for the Enabling of intra-European Tourism,"" which was issued last month.

The Austria/Germany land border has also reopened -- travel between Austria and Germany is possible as of June 15 -- and restrictions around the country are being relaxed.

Visitors from destinations such as Australia and Canada will also be allowed to enter soon due to the EU's decision to lift restrictions on various countries outside of the bloc.

Chancellor Angela Merkel recently announced social distancing rules would continue until at least October.

Greece

International flights to Greece resumed on July 1. cunfek/Getty Images

International direct flights to Greece's many holiday destinations restarted on July 1 for travelers from most of the EU and list of 14 additional EU-approved countries , with travelers subject only to random checks.

Greece has also extended its travel ban on direct flights from the UK and Sweden until July 15. All information is expected to be updated by mid-July.

The US, Greece's third largest market, is not included on the EU list. Nearly 2 million Americans visited Greece in 2019. The country has been attracting a growing number of US travelers in recent years and was projected to grow further in 2020.

Russia also failed to make the EU list meaning that Greece will enter its peak season without the three countries that in 2019 accounted for about 20% of its tourism revenue.

Greece is also opening its international ports and some border crossings for the first time since the country imposed a strict lockdown over three months ago.

The country is being hailed as one of the safest destinations for holidaymakers in the Mediterranean this summer with under 200 deaths from Covid-19 and less than 3,500 cases in a population of 11 million.

As part of the measures to contain the spread of Covid-19, international travelers are required to fill in a detailed passenger form. The Passenger Locator Form (PLF) will have to be completed online at least 48 hours before entering the country and includes information such as duration of previous stays in other countries during the two weeks prior to travel, and the address of stay in Greece.

Travelers will receive QR codes based on an algorithm that will calculate those most at risk of spreading a coronavirus infection. Authorities will use the QR code to identify passengers who need to be tested upon arrival, Greece's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has said.

Those tested must quarantine overnight pending results. Those who test positive will be quarantined for up to 14 days.

Hungary

Travelers from outside the European Union hoping to visit Hungary this summer will have to wait a little longer.

Prime Minister Viktor Orban announced Thursday that the Central European country would only be reopening its borders to one of the 14 EU-approved ""safe"" countries in order to protect the ""health interests"" of residents.

Its southern neighbor Serbia, home to a large ethnic Hungarian minority, was the sole non-EU country to make the cut.

The decision came just days after the EU's request for its member states to lift travel restrictions for various countries outside the bloc, including China, provided it reciprocates the move, Australia and Japan.

""For the time being, with the exception of Serbia, we can't comply with the EU's request that we allow entry to citizens from outside the bloc because that would be contrary to the health interests of the Hungarian people,"" Orban said in a video posted on his Facebook page.

However, Hungary will reinstate a ""humanitarian corridor"" for travelers passing through the country, according to the prime minister.

At the time of writing, Hungary had reported over 4,000 confirmed Covid-19 cases and 587 deaths.

Although lockdown restrictions have been lifted throughout the country, wearing a face mask is mandatory while in shops and on public transport.

Iceland

Iceland reopened it borders to tourists on June 15 after recording just under 2,000 confirmed Covid-19 cases.

The move came weeks after the Nordic country banned all foreign nationals, except for nationals of the EU and associated European countries.

Up until recently, everyone arriving from outside the country was required to go into quarantine for 14 days.

However, travelers now have the option to either submit to a Covid-19 test on arrival, provide proof of a recently taken test with a negative result, or agree to a two-week quarantine.

Although the tests are currently free, a $112 charge will be implemented from July 1.

Visitors will also be encouraged to download the app Rakning C-19, designed to help trace the origin of transmissions and available in seven languages -- Icelandic, English, Polish, German, French, Spanish and Italian.

""When travelers return to Iceland we want to have all mechanisms in place to safeguard them and the progress made in controlling the pandemic,"" Thordis Kolbrun Reykfjord Gylfadottir, Minister of Tourism, Industry and Innovation said in an official statement last month.

""Iceland's strategy of large-scale testing, tracing and isolating have proven effective so far.

""We want to build on that experience of creating a safe place for those who want a change of scenery after what has been a tough spring for all of us.""

Italy

Italy has been one of the destinations worst hit by the pandemic, but the hugely popular European country is keen to get its tourism industry up and running now that infection rates have slowed down.

Travelers from the EU, along with the UK and the microstates and principalities of Andorra, Monaco, San Marino and the Vatican, were allowed to enter without having to go into quarantine starting June 3, in a move the government has described as a ""calculated risk.""

""We're facing a calculated risk in the knowledge that the contagion curve may rise again,"" Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said in a televised address to the nation earlier this month.

""We have to accept it; otherwise, we will never be able to start up again.""

However, Italy, has also indicated it will not be complying with the EU's request to lift travel restrictions for 14 countries outside the bloc.

A mandatory quarantine remains in place for all other nations and it seems officials are not planning to lift this any time soon.

""The situation on a global level remains very complex,"" Italy's health minister Roberto Speranza told Italian news agency ANSA shortly after the announcement was made on Tuesday.

""We must not allow the sacrifices of Italians in recent months being made in vain.""

All museums, including Rome's Vatican Museums , have been slowly reopening throughout May with strict social-distancing rules. Bars and restaurants were permitted to reopen with reduced numbers of diners as well as plastic shields to divide customers, on May 18.

St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican also opened its doors again on May 18 after being closed for over two months, the Leaning Tower of Pisa has reopened, while the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express is scheduled to return to railways on July 8.

Jamaica

Jamaica reopened to international tourists on June 15, nearly three months after closing its borders.

Up until the end of June, travelers heading to the Caribbean island will be required to complete a travel authorization form within 72 hours of departure and be willing to undergo a test for Covid-19 on arrival.

A ""resilient corridor"" has also been introduced, limiting the movement of visitors to a section of Jamaica's northern coast between Negril and Port Antonio.

Hotels and businesses within this area are allowed to reopen provided they have received a ""Covid-19 Readiness Certificate"".

Visitors will also be required to adhere to local protocols, such as wearing face masks or coverings in public and social distancing.

""Tourism is the lifeblood of our local economy, and with the help of international experts and a dedicated task force, we have developed protocols that allow us to safely reopen our borders,"" Jamaica's Director of Tourism Donovan White said in a statement.

""We are confident that as we restart our economy, Jamaicans will work together to ensure a safe, secure and seamless experience for our tourism workers, their families, and visitors, while preserving the authentic experiences travelers seek when they visit our shores.""

Jamaica welcomes over 4.3 million visitors each year, with tourism accounting for 34% of its GDP.

The Maldives

The Maldives closed its national borders and canceled all flights shortly after recording its first two coronavirus cases in March.

However, around 30 resorts here have stayed open , with tourists opting to self-isolate in the famous honeymoon destination rather than return home.

The island nation, which is made up of over 1,000 islands, has recorded around 1,457 confirmed cases and five deaths from Covid-19 so far.

While it was previously thought the destination would reopen at the end of the year, officials have brought this forward to July.

A spokesperson for the tourism board has confirmed the Maldives will be open to tourists of all nationalities from July.

While a previous draft proposal indicated travelers would need to present a medical certificate confirming proof of a negative Covid-19 test, the new plans will see visitors allowed to enter the country without prior testing or a mandatory quarantine period.

There are also no new visa requirements or additional fees.

""We are planning to reopen our borders for visitors in July, 2020,"" reads an official statement issued by the Ministry of Tourism on May 30.

""We also want to assure our guests that they will not be charged any additional fees to enter the Maldives.""

The government is also considering issuing a ""Safe Tourism License"" for tourist facilities that comply with government legislation and certain safety requirements, such as having a certified medic readily available and holding an ""adequate stock"" of PPE equipment.

But the destination's tourism board has confirmed that visitors will not have to commit to spending a minimum of 14 days in the country, as was previously suggested, nor will they need to have a confirmed booking with a tourist facility with a ""Safe Tourism License.""

The Maldives received more than 1.7 million visitors in 2019 and the destination had expected numbers to rise to two million in 2020.

Malta

Shortly after Malta registered its first Covid-19 case in March, a mandatory 14-day self-quarantine was put in place for all tourists entering the small Mediterranean country.

Outbound flights to France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Switzerland were then suspended, before all flight departures and arrivals were banned on March 20.

Prime Minister Robert Abela recently confirmed Malta will be reopening its borders to visitors from at least 17 countries on July 1.

Travelers from Germany, Austria, Cyprus, Switzerland, Iceland, Slovakia, Norway, Denmark, Hungary, Finland, Ireland, Lithuania, Israel, Latvia, Estonia, Luxembourg, and the Czech Republic will all be permitted to enter without going into self-isolation for two weeks.

The destinations chosen are those apparently deemed ""safe"" by the Malta Tourism Authority with regards to Covid-19 transmission.

However, restrictions on all other flight destinations will be lifted from July 15, according to officials.

Mexico

Mexico is aiming to welcome visitors back within weeks.

While the nation remains in lockdown, with hotels and restaurants yet to recommence business, officials are planning to reopen the country bit by bit in order to get things back on track.

""The plan for the country is to open in stages and by regions,"" WTTC CEO Gloria Guevara told CNN Travel recently.

""The target is domestic travelers first, followed by travelers from the US and Canada and then the rest of the world.

However, the border between the US and Mexico border will remain closed to ""nonessential"" travel until July 21, according to a statement from the US Department of Homeland Security on June 16.

The restrictions were first announced in mid-March.

While most international flights in and out of Mexico's key airports are currently suspended or significantly reduced, Delta Air Lines will be increasing and/or resuming various services from the US to Cancun, Mexico City Los Cabos and Puerta Vallarta in the coming weeks.

Quintana Roo, a state on the Caribbean side of Mexico that's home to the likes of Cancun, Playa del Carmen and Tulum, hopes to reopen in mid-June, according to Marisol Vanegas, the state's tourism secretary.

""We want to revive tourism and expect to start opening sights and hotels sometime between June 10 and 15 but don't know which ones yet,"" she says.

""It depends on what the federal government allows us to do.""

Meanwhile, Los Cabos will kick off a five-phase plan to revive tourism in June.

Rodrigo Esponda, managing director of the Los Cabos Tourism Board, says he hopes to be able to accept both international and domestic travelers by August and September.

However, beach destination Riviera Nayarit, situated north of Puerta Vallarta, currently has no immediate plans to bring back tourists, according to Richard Zarkin, the public relations manager for the Riviera Nayarit Convention and Visitors Bureau.

Portugal

Portugal is keen to revive its struggling tourism industry, with Foreign Minister Augusto Santos Silva recently declaring ""tourists are welcome.""

Incoming flights from outside the EU are now slowly starting up again, with TAP Air Portugal, Portugal's national airline , resuming its nonstop flight between Lisbon and Newark airport earlier this month.

Travelers from EU nations, apart from Italy and Spain, are now permitted to enter the country without going into quarantine.

However, temperature checks will be taken on arrival and visitors will need to comply with local social distancing measures.

The land border between Portugal and Spain, which has been closed to tourists since March, is unlikely to reopen until at least July 1.

""We are gradually going to start looking at easing border controls,"" Internal Affairs Minister Eduardo Cabrita said earlier this month.

In May, officials began putting measures in place to ensure foreign travelers would feel confident to return to Portugal.

Rita Marques, the country's Secretary of State for Tourism, has launched a ""don't cancel, postpone"" scheme, allowing tourists to reschedule any pre-arranged holidays to Portugal until the close of 2021.

This is valid for all bookings made through accredited travel agencies, along with hotels or Airbnbs, for trips scheduled between March 13 and September 30, 2020.

In addition, national tourism authority Turismo de Portugal has created a free hygiene-certification stamp to distinguish ""Clean & Safe"" tourism enterprises to increase visitors' confidence.

Businesses will have to comply with hygiene and cleaning requirements for the prevention and control of Covid-19 to receive the stamp, which is valid for one year.

According to Santos Silva, Portugal's airports will soon be introducing health checks for arrivals, but visitors will not be subject to a mandatory quarantine

Spain

Spain's lockdown was one of the toughest in Europe, but restrictions have gently been lifted.

Beaches reopened in June while hotels in some parts of the country have also been permitted to resume business.

Now the European destination, which welcomed a record 84 million visitors in 2019, has moved forward its reopening date, granting EU travelers permission to enter without having to quarantine for two weeks from June 21.

While there's been little mention of opening borders to travelers beyond the EU, it's thought Spain is hoping to follow the lead of destinations such as Lithuania and the Czech Republic by establishing safe corridors, or a ""travel bubble,"" with nearby destinations that have managed to keep the outbreak under control.

""We have to guarantee, when international tourism opens, that the person who comes to Spain is a safe person,"" Spanish Tourism Minister Reyes Maroto recently told local newspaper El Pais.

""The issue of borders will be accompanied by the evolution of the health crisis.""

As part of the European Union, Spain will also be open to the 15 countries the EU is lifting its external border to.

At present, it's mandatory for anyone six and older to wear face masks while in public, both indoors and outdoors, ""where it is not possible to maintain [an interpersonal] distance.""

St. Lucia is one of several Caribbean islands trying for a tourism comeback.

The tropical destination, which closed its orders to foreign travelers on March 23, began its phased reopening on June 4, when it lifted its borders to visitors from the United States.

Those traveling to the country must present ""certified proof"" of a negative Covid-19 test taken within 48 hours of boarding their flight.

Visitors will also be subject to screening and temperature checks by port health authorities and must wear face masks and maintain social distancing during their visit.

Officials are also bringing in new safety measures for taxis to separate drivers and passengers.

""Our new protocols have been carefully crafted and will build confidence among travelers and our citizens,"" Minister of Tourism Dominic Fedee said in a statement.

""The government of Saint Lucia remains resolved to protect both lives and livelihoods as it jump starts its economy.""

Local businesses have also been allowed to reopen, provided they have appropriate cleaning measures and social distancing measures in place.

Details of the second phase of the island's reopening, which is to begin on August 1, will be announced in the coming weeks.

Thailand

Thailand has long been among the top destinations for travelers, receiving close to 40 million foreign tourists last year.

However, visitors have been banned from entering the Southeast Asian country since March because of the pandemic.

While the number of cases here has been relatively low in comparison to other destinations -- Thailand has reported more than 3,000 confirmed cases and over 50 deaths -- officials aren't taking any chances when it comes to reopening the country.

""It is still dependent on the outbreak situation, but I think the earliest we may see the return of tourists could be the fourth quarter of this year,"" Yuthasak Supasorn, governor of the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) told CNN Travel.

The governor went on to stress there will be limitations on who can visit the country and what regions they can go to once restrictions are relaxed.

""We are not going to open all at once,"" he added. ""We are still on high alert, we just can't let our guards down yet.

""We have to look at the country of origin [of the travelers] to see if their situation has truly improved.""

This effectively means Thailand is unlikely to open its borders to travelers from destinations that don't appear to have the coronavirus situation under control.

Those that are given permission to enter may be offered ""long-stay packages"" in isolated areas ""where health monitoring can be easily controlled,"" such as the remote islands of Koh Pha Ngan and Koh Samui.

On July 1, a ban on international flights was lifted by The Civil Aviation Authority of Thailand (CAAT) provided certain conditions are met

Business travelers and those seeking medical treatment in Thailand are among those now permitted to enter the country.

The lack of foreign tourists means that visitor numbers will drop to 14 to 16 million this year, according to TAT.

But like many other global destinations, Thailand has been focusing on domestic tourism.

In fact, some resorts and hotels have already been given the go ahead to reopen -- Hua Hin, located about 200 kilometers (124 miles) south of Bangkok, being one of them.

Shopping malls, museums, markets and some tourist attractions have also been reopening their doors, with Bangkok's Grand Palace resuming business on June 4.

Turkey

Turkey made over $34.5 billion from tourism in 2019, and the transcontinental country was eager to get back in business.

Like many other countries, the popular destination opted to restart domestic tourism before beginning to welcome foreign visitors.

International flights routes to and from Turkey have been gradually restarting throughout June, with the UK, Germany, Austria, Croatia, Hong Kong and Switzerland among the 40 nations Turkey is now receiving travelers from.

While tourists are not required to undergo Covid-19 tests before their trip, all visitors will receive a medical evaluation, including temperature checks, on arrival.

""When foreign visitors come, they will be health-checked, and body temperatures will be measured. If there is a suspicion, tourists will be taken for a PCR test.

""These measurements will start in Antalya, Bodrum, Dalaman, Izmir, Istanbul airports, the country's provinces with the most tourist attraction,"" Mehmet Nuri Ersoy, Minister of Culture and Tourism for Turkey, said earlier this month

The country has also set out new guidelines for its hotels and resort facilities, such as temperature checks at entrances and at least 12 hours of room ventilation after checkout. Guests will be required to wear face masks and maintain social distancing.

""The more transparent and detailed information we give, the more we will earn the confidence of tourists,"" Ersoy previously said while revealing plans to open around half of Turkey's hotels this year.

Meanwhile, restrictions on intercity travel have been lifted, while restaurants, cafes, parks and sports facilities are permitted to reopen from June 1, along with beaches and museums.

When the UAE, which is made up of seven emirates, closed its borders in March, the stringent restrictions included withdrawing tourist visas and banning all outgoing flights.

But the Emirati authorities have been gradually scaling down these restrictions over the past few weeks.

On July 7, Dubai finally reopened to international visitors. But there are a number of new protocols in place.

Tourists are required to take a Covid-19 test within four days of departure (96 hours). Those who are unable to provide proof of this on arrival will be tested at the airport.

Visitors are also required to fill out a health declaration before their visit and show they have adequate health insurance.

On entering Dubai, all travelers must download the Dubai Covid-19 DXB contact tracing app and register their details. Its public beaches, parks and water parks have all resumed business -- under strict social distancing guidelines.

At hotels, guests are required to wear masks at all times and can only check in to rooms 24 hours after the previous guest has checked out

The emirate of Abu Dhabi remains closed to travelers at present.

United Kingdom

When other destinations were relaxing travel restrictions and bringing in measures to lure travelers back, the UK opted to enact stricter regulations.

However, the government has chosen to relax quarantine rules for travelers from a number of destinations, including France, Italy and Spain.

From July 10, travelers in England from 58 selected countries will no longer have to self-isolate for 14 days.

The US, Portugal and China are among the destinations that aren't on the list, which is ""under constant review.""

Although the same applies to tourists visiting Wales and Northern Ireland, Scotland has issued its own separate list of 39 countries, which Spain is notably absent from.

""Whether you are a holidaymaker ready to travel abroad or a business eager to open your doors again, this is good news for British people and great news for British businesses,"" Grant Shapps, UK secretary of state for transport, said in a statement last week.

""The entire nation has worked tirelessly to get to this stage, therefore safety must remain our watch word and we will not hesitate to move quickly to protect ourselves if infection rates rise in countries we are reconnecting with

The changes will come as a welcome move for those frustrated by the UK's mandatory two-week quarantine , which came into effect on June 8.

Paul Charles, a member of Quash Quarantine, a campaign group lobbying the government to drop the quarantine, previously described the guidelines as ""unworkable and unenforceable.""

""A lot of jobs have gone in the last few weeks as people haven't been able to book holidays because they've been fearful of quarantine,"" Charles told CNN Travel last month.

""So, quarantine itself has acted as a block to future bookings.""

The approved destinations pose ""a reduced risk to the public health of UK citizens,"" according to the UK Department for Transport.

""We will keep the conditions in these countries and territories under review,"" reads a government statement.",2020-07-14,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/global-destinations-reopening-to-tourists/index.html
Rebecca Cairns,"We've been using the same bricks for over 5,000 years. This engineer says it's time for a change.","Written by Rebecca Cairns, CNN

Although we're surrounded by millions of them every day, most of us don't think about bricks too often. For thousands of years , the humble clay-fired brick hasn't changed. The building blocks of modern suburban homes would be familiar to the city planners of ancient Babylon, the bricklayers of the Great Wall of China, or the builders of Moscow's Saint Basil's Cathedral.

But the brick as we know it causes significant environmental problems, by using up raw, finite materials and creating carbon emissions. That's why Gabriela Medero, a professor of Geotechnical and Geoenvironmental Engineering at Scotland's Heriot-Watt University, decided to reinvent it.

Originally from Brazil, Medero says she was drawn to civil engineering because it gave her passion for maths and physics a practical outlet. As she became aware of the construction industry's sustainability issues, she started looking for solutions. With her university's support, Medero joined forces with fellow engineer Sam Chapman and set up Kenoteq in 2009.

The ancient temples of Bagan, Myanmar, showcase the amazing possibilities of brickwork. Among the Credit: Bricks have been a staple building material for at least 9,000 years , and the invention of fired bricks around 3,500 BCE opened up new and exciting possibilities for design and architecture.The ancient temples of Bagan, Myanmar, showcase the amazing possibilities of brickwork. Among the 3,595 temples , stupas, and spiritual structures built between the 11th and 13th century, Dhammayangyi Temple is renowned for its intricate design.

The company's signature product is the K-Briq. Made from more than 90% construction waste, Medero says the K-Briq -- which does not need to be fired in a kiln -- produces less than a tenth of the carbon emissions of conventional bricks. With the company testing new machinery to start scaling up production, Medero hopes her bricks will help to build a more sustainable world.

The problem with bricks

Although they're made from natural materials, there are problems with bricks at every step of their production.

Bricks are made from clay -- a type of soil found all over the world. Clay mining strips the land's fertile topsoil, inhibiting plant growth

In conventional brick production, the clay is shaped and baked in kilns at temperatures up to 1,250°C (2,280°F). The majority of brick kilns are heated by fossil fuels, which contribute to climate change.

Once made, bricks must be transported to construction sites, generating more carbon emissions.

Globally, 1,500 billion bricks are produced, every year. Laid end-to-end, they would stretch to the moon and back 390 times.

The environmental footprint of different bricks reflects multiple factors including the type of kiln , fuel, and transportation. But with so many produced, their impact adds up, says Medero.

Enter the K-Briq. To make it, construction and demolition waste including bricks, gravel, sand and plasterboard is crushed and mixed with water and a binder. The bricks are then pressed in customized molds. Tinted with recycled pigments, they can be made in any color.

Earlier this year, Kenoteq won its first commission -- to supply bricks for the Serpentine Pavilion 2020 in London's Hyde Park (although the project has been postponed until summer 2021 due to the current pandemic). Designed by architectural studio Counterspace, the building will incorporate K-Briqs in grey, black and 12 shades of pink. The Pavilion's lead architect, Sumayya Vally, says that as a recycled product, the K-Briq appealed to her. It ""embodies"" the past through its use of old materials, she says, adding that because the bricks can be customized, they allow ""the designer to be a part of the construction process of the material,"" creating unique opportunities in architecture.

Why can't old bricks be re-used?

In the UK, around 2.5 billion new bricks are used in construction every year -- and about the same number of old bricks are demolished. A seemingly simple solution to the brick production problem would be to re-use old bricks.

But it's not that straightforward. According to Bob Geldermans, a climate design and sustainability researcher at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, reclaiming bricks is an expensive and ""labor-intensive process.""

According to the UK's Brick Development Association , old brick structures need to be carefully dismantled and the bricks cleaned of mortar with hammers and chisels. Reclaimed bricks are used to help renovate historic buildings or for other specialized projects but for mass construction, the process is too costly.

An additional barrier is that there's no standardized way to check the strength, safety or durability of reclaimed bricks.

Medero says that K-Briqs could solve both these problems.

According to Medero, the K-Briq will be comparably priced to conventional bricks. Additionally, as a new product, the K-Briq has been subjected to rigorous assessment at the materials testing lab at Heriot-Watt University, and certified by BBA (British Board of Agrement). Medero claims that K-Briqs are stronger and more durable than fired clay bricks, and provide better insulation, too.

Scaling up

Kenoteq currently operates one workshop in Edinburgh, which can produce three million K-Briqs a year. Medero is looking at scaling up -- but it's hard to create a revolution in construction.

Geldermans says that the industry is notoriously slow to change -- adding that legislation often lags far behind innovation, so construction companies are not incentivized to adopt sustainable practices and materials.

Stephen Boyle is the program manager for construction at non-profit Zero Waste Scotland which, along with organizations including Scottish Enterprise and the Royal Academy of Engineering, has provided Kenoteq with funding. He attributes the industry's conservatism to a ""chicken and egg"" situation. Innovative startups need large contracts to allow them to scale, he says, but struggle to become competitive without a large operation already in place.

But despite the challenges, Kenoteq is far from being the only company trying to make construction more sustainable. Other innovators include Qube , an India-based startup creating bricks out of plastic waste, and the ClickBrick which eliminates the use of cement through modular stacking (think real-life Lego).

There are signs of change. In Scotland, the government is reviewing a circular economy bill which encourages businesses to think creatively and economically about how they reuse and recycle materials. Boyle says that there are ""contractors who would use [K-Briqs] tomorrow,"" if they were being produced on a large scale.

Over the next 18 months, Medero plans to get K-Briq machinery on-site at recycling plants. This will increase production while reducing transport-related emissions, she says, because trucks can collect K-Briqs when they drop off construction waste. ""We need to have ways of building sustainably, with affordable, good quality materials that will last.""",2020-07-14,https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/going-green-kbriq-sustainable-brick-spc-intl/index.html
Helen Regan,"Before the virus, Asia's ecosystems were buckling under overtourism. When the tourists return, it has to be different","(CNN) — Before the pandemic put a stop to most international travel, each year millions of people flocked to Southeast Asia's white sandy beaches, ancient temples and diverse wildlife.

Last year, 133 million tourists visited the region , spurred by an increase in arrivals from China, which is now the world's largest market for outbound travel.

In some places the crowds became so intense it caused locals, environmentalists and even governments to complain that overtourism was pushing the region's fragile ecosystems to breaking point.

Coral die-offs, vanishing marine life, damaged cultural sites and idyllic islands overflowing with plastic and human waste were all blamed on too many tourists -- and the unchecked development set up to attract and accommodate them.

Then the global coronavirus pandemic struck. Countries went into lockdown. International travel dramatically reduced. And the tourists were largely gone.

an estimated For countries like Cambodia, where tourism contributesan estimated 30% of GDP, the effect has been devastating. Asia-Pacific is estimated to lose $34.6 billion due to the pandemic, the Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA) said

As travel restrictions lift, countries that rely heavily on tourism will be competing for visitors as they seek to rebuild their economies. The temptation to attract as many tourists as possible could be difficult to resist.

But experts say the global pause on tourism has offered countries an unprecedented opportunity to examine how to rebuild their tourism industries in a way that benefits their economies and also protects the planet.

An example

As one of the most popular destinations in Southeast Asia, the Philippines welcomes millions of tourists each year, many who visit outlying tropical islands for their sandy beaches and clear waters.

In 2018, so many tourists visited Boracay island that President Roderigo Duterte famously said it had been turned into a ""cesspool,"" and ordered it to close for six months for a massive cleanup.

A tourism boom had encouraged unscrupulous operators to prioritize short-term profits over sustainability, said John Paolo R. Rivera, associate director of the Dr. Andrew L. Tan Center for Tourism. As visitor numbers rose, illegal structures were built close to the beach, many with sewage pipes that led straight out to sea.

After a months-long shutdown, the island reopened in October 2018 with new limits on visitor numbers from 19,000 to 6,000 and bans on smoking and drinking alcohol on the beach. Hotels must now be accredited and comply with environmental standards, including proper waste disposal, and the no-build zone has been extended to 30 meters from the shoreline.

While many welcomed the cleaner, quieter island, its closure came at the expense of locals' livelihoods. Some residents claimed their houses and businesses were flattened in ""illegal"" demolitions and migrant workers were forced to find jobs elsewhere.

Susanne Becken, director of the Griffith Institute for Tourism in Melbourne, said it is a ""brutal"" move to completely shut down a place as a lot of lives depend on tourism. She said lessons could be learned by governments and operators preparing to open after the pandemic.

""Thinking about the resilience of the place and diversifying or making sure the livelihoods are diversifying enough that not everything depends on tourism. This readjustment in the moment is a bit of a shock, but hopefully long term it's a reality check,"" said Becken.

Nature

Boracay may have been shut down for a short period of time by a president focused on environmental recovery, but other tourism sites have been forced to close by a virus that shows no sign of ending. While the halt in international travel may be financially devastating for many businesses, in some places nature is starting to heal.

Green and leatherback turtles have been seen nesting on beaches popular with tourists in Thailand, and dugongs have been sighted off the coast of Trang, in the country's south.

""At Maya Beach we saw groups of black tip reef sharks, at Similan islands we saw dolphins, whale sharks and in many areas we saw turtles to lay eggs. Even inland national parks we also saw rare animals like tigers,"" said Thanya Netithummakun, director general of Thailand's Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation.

The wildlife sightings have even prompted Thailand's Minister of National Resources and Environment to close the national parks to the public for two months every year.

Some of that is a result of efforts to reduce visitor numbers on popular islands, before the pandemic hit.

""We have halved numbers of operators and tourists in several places,"" said Thanya. ""For example, Chumporn Islands can only have 400 visitors a day (and the) Similan Islands will receive tourists at half of what it used to accommodate.""

One of Thailand's most famous beaches, Maya Bay -- featured in the 2000 movie ""The Beach"" -- has been closed since June 2018 to rehabilitate the marine area, and is unlikely to open until at least June 2021.

At the height of its fame, around 5,000 people visited the bay each day. During its closure, thousands of corals have been planted in the bay to repair damage caused by dive trips and tourist boats.

An electronic ticketing system is being developed to control tourist numbers when it reopens and boat operators will need to install digital trackers if they want to dock there.

Easing the crowds

Ticketing and visitor caps have long been a way to control tourist numbers in many destinations around the world. But the necessary level of infrastructure hasn't yet made its way to some of the most beautiful -- and far-flung -- destinations in Asia.

And in some cases, social media has attracted tourists to a particular destination far faster than officials have worked to control the numbers. For example, the temples in Bagan, Myanmar, have become incredibly popular with Instagrammers -- though it has to be the right one.

""There is just one particular temple where people feel that is the one temple to see the sunset -- in a place where there are thousands of temples where you can go to. There is no logic,"" said Willem Niemeijer, founder of Bangkok-based sustainable travel group YAANA Ventures.

Niemeijer said one way around this is to use technology to manage the numbers. Making a reservation on an app or website before visiting could help limit crowd numbers at one site.

""If you have to make a reservation before, what you will see is people say that's too much trouble, I'll go to another temple. Immediately, you get a visitor spread and with that spread of the dollar,"" he said.

Technology is already helping reduce footfall at popular sites in Europe. Galleries and museums in major cities like Paris, Florence or Barcelona, have crowd control methods that limit the amount of people flooding in.

Similar methods could be used for natural tourist sites around Asia that in the past have never needed to be protected from large crowds.

""What most all these sites have in common is there has been no regulation, no management of any visitors whatsoever and that is where it goes off the rails,"" said Niemeijer. ""We know this from museums worldwide -- you know that you have to order tickets online before you go, otherwise you can't get in.""

But while ticketing could help manage crowds, in some places the management needs to go further.

Angkor Wat complex in Cambodia is an important site of religious, cultural and historical significance. More than two million people visited in 2019, and while that was lower than previous years, the annual stampede is threatening the site's foundations.

UNESCO reported that the tourism boom and an increasing population in the nearby town of Siem Reap had caused water shortages. That led the authorities to tap into groundwater, ""dangerously lowering the water table"" and causing subsidence in the ground the Angkor temples stand on.

In recent years, local authorities have raised ticket prices and limited the number of people who can watch the sunset from the hill at popular Phnom Bakheng, but other areas of the archaeological park, which spans 400 square kilometers, remain unprotected.

Spreading visitors around the country, instead of promoting just two or three key sites is another way to ease the pressure at certain locations.

Drawing investment and attracting brands to other beaches, cultural sites or islands that are not as well known will help spread tourists -- and their money -- across a bigger area, Niemeijer said.

Rivera agrees.

""There are so many equally beautiful destinations in the Philippines,"" he said. ""There is no need for tourists to crowd in one destination. Given capacity planning, destination managers can redistribute tourists so the carrying capacity can be met.""

Planning is key here, Becken cautions, because if the location isn't prepared with proper infrastructure and sewage systems, ""just to disperse them could cause more damage in the end.""

Preparing for the recovery

With the pandemic still raging in many parts of the world there are huge unknowns as to when international travel will pick up again, or what it will look like when it does.

Becken said that over the past 20 to 30 years, tourism in Southeast Asia became ""incredibly inflated"" in part driven by cheap airfares, which governments didn't question.

Now is the time for countries to rethink whether they want to welcome back the budget holiday tourist who comes for a few days and doesn't spend a lot of money, or properly analyze what they want from tourism, she said.

Rivera, from the Dr. Andrew L. Tan Center for Tourism, said the pandemic should prompt a shift in business models towards sustainable tourism -- with consequences for not complying.

""Other than environmental fees, and visitor caps, serious penalties also have to be imposed for those who cannot comply with destination rules and regulations,"" said Rivera.

In Bali, officials have proposed a $10 tax on foreign tourists that they hope will be imposed this year. The money will ""fund programs to preserve the environment and Balinese culture,"" according to the Jakarta Post. A study carried out by Udayana University reportedly found that tourists would have no problem paying the fee if it helps the environment.

Rivera said these efforts must include community ownership and engagement so locals can see long-term value in protecting sites of international interest, while having a say in how things are managed and enjoying a fair share of the profits.

That would require more investment in education and training -- a difficult prospect during an economic downturn -- but one that would eventually pay off, Becken said.

A similar approach needs to be taken with ways to reduce overcrowding. Cutting visitor numbers should only happen if it's in combination with programs that protects peoples' livelihoods, Becken said.

That could include everything from promoting conservation projects, to social enterprise initiatives that connect communities with tourists, to the sharing economy linking up travelers with local guides, or hotels taking a more active role in the community by building sewage pipes to nearby villages, for example, she said.

Earlier this month, the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) announced a new initiative calling for responsible Covid-19 recovery for the tourism sector.

""Sustainability must no longer be a niche part of tourism but must be the new norm for every part of our sector,"" said UNWTO Secretary-General Zurab Pololikashvili. ""It is in our hands to transform tourism and that emerging from COVID-19 becomes a turning point for sustainability.""

For Thanya, finding the right balance is key.

""We are looking for a more eco-friendly tourism,"" he said. But he recognizes that ""tourism contributes to a big part of national income and it generates a lot of jobs and money for locals as well.""",2020-07-14,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/southeast-asia-overtourism-coronavirus-intl-hnk/index.html
Nectar Gan,China has just contained the coronavirus. Now it's battling some of the worst floods in decades,"(CNN) Weeks of torrential rains have caused the worst flooding in China in recent decades, destroying the homes and livelihoods of millions of people as the country struggles to revive an economy battered by the coronavirus pandemic.

Since June, devastating floods have impacted 38 million people -- more than the entire population of Canada. Some 2.24 million residents have been displaced, with 141 people dead or missing, the Ministry of Emergency Management said Monday.

On Sunday, Chinese authorities raised the country's flood alert to the second highest level in a four-tier emergency response system. Chinese President Xi Jinping described the flood control situation as "" very grim "" and called for ""stronger and more effective measures"" to protect lives and assets.

Rescuers evacuate residents on a raft through flood waters in Jiujiang in central China's Jiangxi province on July 8.

The unfolding disaster comes as China is still reeling from the aftermath of the coronavirus.

The pandemic and a weeks-long shutdown throughout much of China dealt a historic blow to the country's economy. GDP shrank 6.8% in the first quarter, the first contraction that Beijing has reported since 1976. The country promised in May to throw 3.6 trillion yuan ($500 billion) at its economy this year in tax cuts, infrastructure projects and other stimulus measures as part of a bid to create 9 million jobs and blunt the fallout from the pandemic.

The flooding is likely to complicate those recovery efforts. Some of the worst affected areas include many of the regions hardest hit by the coronavirus, just months after they emerged from strict lockdown measures.

While summer flooding is a common reoccurrence in China due to the seasonal rains, this year's deluge is particularly bad. It has hit 27 out of the 31 provincial regions in mainland China, and in some places, water levels have reached perilous heights not seen since 1998, when massive floods killed more than 3,000 people.

Floodwaters flow past a residential building in Chongqing in southwest China on July 1.

A total of 443 rivers nationwide have been flooded, with 33 of them swelling to the highest levels ever recorded, the Ministry of Water Resources said Monday.

The majority of these rivers are in the vast basin of the Yangtze River, which flows from west to east through the densely populated provinces of central China. The river is the longest and most important waterway in the country, irrigating large swathes of farmland and linking a string of inland industrial metropolises with the commercial hub of Shanghai on the eastern coast.

This year, the summer rains arrived early and poured with unusual intensity. Over the past weeks, the average precipitation in the Yangtze River basin reached a record high since 1961, authorities said

""Compared with before, this year's rainfall was more intense and repeatedly poured down on the same region, which brought significant pressure on flood control,"" Chen Tao, the chief weather forecaster at the National Meteorological Center, was quoted as saying by Xinhua

This aerial view shows a bridge leading to the inundated Tianxingzhou island in Wuhan in China's central Hubei province on July 13.

Sweeping floodwaters left a trail of devastation, ravaging 8.72 million acres of farmland, destroying 28,000 homes and in some cases submerging entire towns.

According to state news agency Xinhua, by Sunday, the floods had caused 82.23 billion yuan ($11.75 billion) of economic losses nationwide.

In central China's Hubei province, which accounted for more than 80% all of China coronavirus cases, historic levels of rainfall were recorded in several cities, causing widespread floods and landslides. As of Thursday, more than 9 million residents have been affected in the province of 60 million people, causing 11.12 billion yuan ($1.59 billion) of economic losses, Xinhua reported.

Last week, authorities in the Hubei provincial capital of Wuhan , the original epicenter of the coronavirus, raised the city's flood alert level to the second highest, after days of heavy downpours submerged many of its roads and a waterfront park.

Residents swim past a riverside pavilion submerged by the flooded Yangtze River in Wuhan in central China's Hubei province on July 8.

Further downstream on the Yangtze River, in eastern Jiangxi province, the water levels in China's biggest freshwater lake, the Poyang Lake, rose to a historic high of 22.52 meters (74 feet), well above the alert level of 19.50 meters (64 feet), according to Xinhua.

As of Sunday afternoon, floods had disrupted the lives of over 5.5 million people in the province, with nearly half a million evacuated from their homes, China's state-broadcaster CCTV reported.

The flooding is unlikely to subside as more heavy rains are forecast for the coming days. On Tuesday, the China Meteorological Administration issued a blue alert for heavy rain from Tuesday to Saturday in multiple provinces in the country, including Sichuan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangsu and Zhejiang.",2020-07-14,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/14/asia/china-flood-coronavirus-intl-hnk/index.html

Kate Springer,What will the national security law mean for travelers -- and Hong Kong's tourism recovery?,"Hong Kong (CNN) — When it comes to desirable post-pandemic travel destinations, Hong Kong would be an obvious choice thanks to its capable handling of Covid-19 outbreaks, which has so far limited infections to just 1,300 cases in the city of 7.5 million.

But now, some travelers may be worried about visiting for a totally different reason.

On June 30, the Chinese government introduced a national security law in Hong Kong that outlaws ""acts of secession, subversion of state power, terrorist activities and collusion with foreign or external forces to endanger national security.""

Hong Kong authorities insist the law will ""only target an extremely small minority of people ,"" yet its broad language and global scope raise questions about what it means for foreign travelers -- and the city's tourism recovery -- once Covid-19 travel restrictions ease.

Related content Which international destinations are reopening to tourists?

The new law's Article 34 states that foreigners in Hong Kong could be ""subject to deportation"" if they contravene the law, even if they are not prosecuted. Meanwhile, Article 38 asserts that the law applies to offenses committed ""outside the region"" by foreigners who are not residents of Hong Kong or China.

This language has spurred discussions in countries such as the United States, Canada, Australia and the UK, prompting them to revise their respective travel advisories, warning citizens of increased risks and ""surveillance,"" ""detention"" and ""deportation"" under the new law, which details a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.

""Combined with Covid-19 and the protests, the national security law has created lots of uncertainty about the upcoming recovery,"" Herbert Yum, a Hong Kong research manager at market research provider Euromonitor International , tells CNN Travel.

""We can expect that visitors from the US and UK will decrease significantly (after Covid-19 restrictions relax) because both governments have expressed lots of concern about the safety and stability of Hong Kong. However, tourists from mainland China, which make up approximately 70% of Hong Kong's total (overnight) tourism arrivals, could feel safer and more willing to come to Hong Kong.""

Will the law impact travelers?

According to a Hong Kong government spokesperson, the national security law should not affect the ""vast majority of Hong Kong people including tourists and investors... who abide by the law and do not participate in acts or activities that undermine national security.""

When asked for specific examples of what types of ""acts or activities"" would impact foreigners visiting Hong Kong, the spokesperson did not elaborate.

However, a Hong Kong Tourism Board spokesperson offered reassurances: ""It's difficult to ascertain the impact of the national security law on Hong Kong tourism at the moment, but it is highly unlikely that bona fide tourists will be affected at all.""

Even so, many foreign governments have expressed concerns about the law. Following its implementation last week, the US State Department revised its travel advisory for Hong Kong

Designated a Level 2 (out of 4) risk level, meaning US citizens should ""exercise increased caution,"" the advisory warns: ""US citizens traveling or residing in Hong Kong may be subject to increased levels of surveillance, as well as arbitrary enforcement of laws and detention for purposes other than maintaining law and order (as a result of the national security law).""

Australia made a similar move, updating its travel advisory to read: ""(The national security law) could be interpreted broadly. You can break the law without intending to. The maximum penalty under this law in Hong Kong is life imprisonment.""

In Canada, authorities warn travelers that they ""may be at increased risk of arbitrary detention on national security grounds and possible extradition to mainland China.""

And in the UK, the Foreign & Commonwealth Office states: ""Mainland authorities could under certain circumstances detain individuals under the terms of this law, with a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. There is therefore an increased risk of detention, and deportation for a non-permanent resident, who commits an offense under the law.""

Professor Xin He, a Chinese law expert at the University of Hong Kong's Department of Law, calls these travel warnings ""overblown.""

""Tourists are extremely unlikely to offend those serious crimes specified by the law,"" he tells CNN Travel, noting that neighboring Macao, which is also a special administrative region of China, has similar laws.

""The law is trying to stabilize Hong Kong's situation and attract more tourists.""

Sharing this sentiment, Hong Kong Tourism Board chairman Pang Yiu-kai told the South China Morning Post , a Hong Kong-based, English-language publication, that he didn't think the law would scare away travelers since foreigners still visit mainland China, which also has a national security law.

However, Benjamin Iaquinto, an assistant professor and tourism geographer at the University of Hong Kong, questions such comparisons.

""Yes, tourists still go to China (despite the local laws), they still go see the Great Wall and the Forbidden City and all that,"" Iaquinto tells CNN Travel.

""But those places are so remarkable that you're always going to get tourists to visit them no matter what. Hong Kong doesn't have places like the Great Wall or the Forbidden City, which might be a problem for the tourism industry.""

'Tourists don't like risk'

Senior tourism lecturer Denis Tolkach, who recently transitioned from the School of Hotel and Tourism Management at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University to James Cook University in Australia, says experts are still wrapping their heads around the law.

""There was no draft available until it had passed through the legislature, so we only saw the text on July 1,"" says Tolkach.

""Most legal scholars are still trying to understand what the language means and what repercussions it will have -- that creates uncertainty. Tourists don't like risk and they don't like uncertainty.""

A silver lining, he says, is that no one is heading to Hong Kong right now.

""You could say it's a good thing that currently there is no travel due to the coronavirus anyway. People have the time to decide whether they want to travel to Hong Kong or not, as they watch the situation unfold.""

If no incidents involving tourists occur under the national security law after the borders reopen, he says the perceived risk will likely diminish.

""If you see that other people are traveling without any problems, people will be more relaxed,"" adds Tolkach.

""But you need to be informed about the place you are traveling to and respect the local customs, whether those are cultural or legal. So be informed.""

Running afoul of the law

The enactment of Hong Kong national security law has sparked wide concerns and fears in Hong Kong. In a latest move, the city's Education Bureau ordered schools to remove books that could violate the law. Speaking to CNN's Ivan Watson , pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong reacts to the controversial bill.

As experts grapple with what's illegal under the new legislation, Professor He says that common concerns such as ""criticizing the leaders of China"" on social media would not ""fall into any of the crimes specified in the law.""

He also says it would be ""extremely unlikely or almost impossible"" for tourists to be detained or extradited to mainland China.

However, providing ""donations and other support to those criminals specified in the NSL (national security law) may be problematic.""

Antony Dapiran, a Hong Kong-based lawyer, photographer and writer who is the author of ""City on Fire: The Fight for Hong Kong,"" agrees that ""ordinary people who have no political involvement or exposure and no public profile"" would not be impacted.

Foreigners or members of the Hong Kong diaspora could be at risk if they ""engaged in anti-government activism abroad,"" particularly if that activism was ""directed towards either secession -- Hong Kong independence or, for that matter, other independence causes such as Taiwan, Tibet or Xinjiang -- or subversion of the Chinese government.""

If business or leisure travelers have ""engaged with foreign governments or organizations in furtherance of those causes,"" he says they could be considered criminals.

""Those who have an elevated risk profile -- such as people involved in anti-China activism abroad, or business travelers in industries and sectors which have an elevated risk exposure -- would no doubt consider their travel plans in light of the new law,"" says Dapiran.

Entering recovery mode

While the law may concern travelers from Western countries, experts agree that it could have the opposite effect on visitors from mainland China -- by far the city's largest and most important tourism market.

""In mainland China, people are not very used to seeing protests -- and this kind of social unrest makes people feel at risk,"" explains Tolkach.

""So if we look at the mainland Chinese visitors, the national security law is supposed to ensure the safety and security of Hong Kong -- (it's) something to be viewed positively by Chinese tourists, to reassure them.""

The city welcomed roughly 51 million tourists from mainland China in 2018 -- or roughly 78% of the 65.1 million total arrivals in 2018, according to data from the Hong Kong Tourism Board , which includes both overnight and same-day visits.

""The major protests started in June (of 2019), but travel was not really affected until about August when the protests and the police response became more intense,"" says Tolkach.

""In November, because of the occupation of the universities -- including Hong Kong Polytechnic University and the Chinese University of Hong Kong -- arrivals dropped by about 50% ... it was most significant for the mainland Chinese market.""

He says a lot of the fear stems from media coverage in mainland China.

""Media outlets in mainland China were portraying the protests very negatively, so it created a lot of uncertainty and Hong Kong felt like a risky destination.""

By the end of last year, total arrivals had decreased 14.2% from 65.1 million in 2018 to 55.9 million in 2019.

This year, the industry has been hit even harder. Due to Covid-19 travel restrictions, the city saw just 3.5 million arrivals between January and May 2020, compared with 29.7 million in the same period last year.

Currently, only Hong Kong residents and some visitors from mainland China, Macao and Taiwan can enter the city. All arrivals must take a compulsory Covid-19 test and quarantine for 14 days.

In the coming months, Euromonitor researcher Yum predicts that Hong Kong tourism will see a sharp recovery once the government finalizes ""travel bubble"" agreements, which may allow quarantine-exempt travel between destinations like Thailand, Japan and mainland China.

""When Hong Kong reopens its borders, visitors from the Asia-Pacific region may rebound quickly,"" adds Yum.

However, the long-term impacts remain unclear.

Hong Kong's evolving image

Tourists rarely make decisions based on politics when it comes to choosing travel destinations, says Iaquinto, pointing to examples like Thailand and Sri Lanka -- two nearby destinations that have maintained successful tourism industries despite long-term political unrest.

However, Hong Kong's image is rooted in its reputation as an open, free and transparent city -- unique selling points that set it apart from some of its neighbors.

""One of the things that makes Hong Kong thrive as a tourism destination is its openness,"" says Iaquinto.

""You have very favorable visa entry requirements for a lot of different passport holders. It has a major airport, which is a massive hub for global air travel.

""If you look at Shenzhen, right across the border, it is like night and day. It is very different.""

Depending on how the law is implemented, Tolkach believes it could also make it challenging for Hong Kong to separate its image from China.

""Hong Kong has a strong brand legacy, and leisure tourists generally are not that political. But if things continue as they are, maybe even Hong Kong, a world-renowned tourist destination, won't be as attractive to international markets,"" explains Tolkach.

""Increasingly, people will be thinking about Hong Kong as part of China, rather than an autonomous entity. So the destination's image and the other related issues, like trusting the authorities, will be similar.",2020-07-14,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/hong-kong-travel-national-security-law/index.html
Justin Solomon,"World's cheapest draft? Where to try bia hoi, Hanoi's 25 cent beer","(CNN) — As soon as the sun sets in Hanoi , Vietnam , there's only one place to be: the corner of Ta Hien and Luong Ngoc Quyen streets.

Known as ""Beer Corner"", this famous intersection in the Old Quarter lures travelers and residents alike to socialize over ice-cold bia hoi (light Vietnamese draft beer) atop tiny plastic stools.

A visit to Beer Corner isn't just about enjoying a few brews -- it's also a window into the history of the city.

""If you really want to get up close and personal with the culture of a new city, in particular the culture of the local people, you need to stroll the sidewalks, sit on a stool and have a nice cold beer,"" Brett MacDouall, co-founder of Hanoi Beer Tour , tells CNN Travel.

""And that's what I love about Ta Hien Street.""

Bonding over beer

It's on Ta Hien Street where MacDouall and co-founder Tan Vu met for the first time in 2005.

While chatting over beer, the two men discovered their fathers both fought in the Vietnam War, albeit on opposing sides.

""So here were two boys, both born in 1974 who grew up in the 1980s,"" says MacDouall. ""I suppose you could say, ideologically, we were very opposed.""

""But the first time we sat down over a cold beer and spoke to one another, we realized that our family values were very similar and have become the best of friends.""

Today, the two men aren't just best buds -- they're also business partners, traipsing around the city with travelers to explore and share the city's stories of beer.

Bia hoi basics

The first brewery in Hanoi opened in the 1890s, when the French controlled the city.

""The French brought the beer drinking culture to Vietnam,"" says MacDouall. ""Before that, [people drank] rice wine.""

After the Hanoi beer brewing factory was set up, beer culture caught on quickly.

Today, Vietnam is one Asia's biggest beer-drinking nations, consuming 3.8 billion liters a year in 2016, according to Ministry of Industry and Trade.

""It evolved through workers [who enjoyed beer] after a hard day's work,"" says MacDouall. ""It was also curiosity -- people wanted to see what Westerners were drinking.""

At the time, however, the beer was expensive, marketed to the city's upper crust.

It wasn't until the late 1950s that bia hoi was introduced as an affordable options for everyday citizens. A brewery opened on Ta Hien Street, selling the fresh lager at just a few cents a mug.

This local staple is a light and refreshing lager, with an alcohol content of less than 3%.

The idea? You can drink it for long sessions to cool off after working all day in Hanoi's sweltering temperatures.

""Some will actually say it is 'instant beer' like instant noodles, since it is made quickly and sold quickly,"" explains MacDouall.

""The alcohol content is low and that was because people wanted to consume it rapidly.""

Over the years, countless bars and restaurants have populated Ta Hien Street, bring with them swathes of tiny stools and metal tables that flank both sides of the sidewalk.

All new brews

Still today, bia hoi is relatively affordable when compared with international labels. A glass of the light lager could set you back anywhere from 15 to 40 US cents.

But that's slowly changing.

""For local owners, selling bia hoi doesn't create enough money to sustain the business,"" says MacDouall.

""So they would rather sell bottled beer and focus on food. But if you still want bia hoi, this is where you come and get it.""

And if you want something other than lager?

Enthusiasts can easily track down local microbreweries and craft beer bars that pour more creative concoctions.

Furbrew , on the banks of West Lake, for example, serves a 'pho' beer that mimics the flavors of the famous dish with a malty, herby, slightly spicy recipe.

Dan Tham,Preserving Macao's handmade signs in the digital age,"Written by Dan Tham, CNN Macao

Perched on a stool in his dusty workshop in Macao, Lam Weng Io looks like a scholar or a librarian, bespectacled and in deep concentration.

With steady hands, he carefully guides a sheet of red acrylic through a cutting machine.

For more than 30 years, Lam has been creating handwritten storefront signs in the former Portuguese colony as a full-time typographer. In each of his characters, Lam aims for a trifecta of balance, clarity and liveliness.

Hundreds of the 65-year-old's signs can be seen all over Macao, a special administrative region that was handed back to China in 1999 after centuries of Portuguese rule.

They're written in traditional Chinese characters -- which are more complicated and contain more strokes -- as opposed to the simplified Chinese characters that were adopted by the mainland in the 1950s, when Macao was still a European colony.

Adorning the entrance to Lam's workshop-cum-abode are bright red letters, wishing good fortune in the Year of the Pig. As he works, wall of white paper scrolls covered with Chinese poems and aphorisms flutter in the breeze.

The machine hums and slices. Lam shifts the sheet this way and that.

After a few minutes of intense focus, Lam frees a word from an acrylic sheet. He holds it up to light, inspects the grooves.

""門."" Chinese for ""gate.""

Photographed above is a Chinese character for ""gate."" Credit: CNN

While this particularly character is usually written as two nonadjacent radicals that look like saloon doors from a Western movie, Lam's 門 comes out in one piece, with the stylized flourishes of a brushstroke.

Lam says he was noticed for his penmanship from an early age.

""I've always been interested in Chinese characters,"" Lam says. ""When I was a student, other classmates would ask me to write characters for them, because they liked the look of my handwriting. When I got older, people told me that I should open my own business.""

Lam's signs advertise doctors' offices and grocery stores, real estate agencies and apartment buildings.

But Lam says business has been slow lately, because shopkeepers across Macao are opting for cheaper, digitally-produced signs over his traditional ones.

""In the digital age, many people don't need you to write for them,"" Lam says. ""I've received fewer customers.""

But technology hasn't spelled total doom for Lam's typography business. In 2014, a chance meeting led Lam to local typeface designer, Benny Tang Pou I, a long-time fan of his work. Tang's award-winning work includes fonts that emulate birds in flight and the cobblestoned streets of Macao.

Tang says he was struck by the beauty of the signs produced by Lam. Together, the two decided to digitize Lam's handwriting, with every stroke in every character replicated on Tang's computer and immortalized as a typeface.

""I would say that handwritten signs, like Mr. Lam's, convey more emotion and humanness,"" the 38-year-old says. ""A digitally-produced sign feels lifeless.""

Tang says he was struck by the beauty of the signs produced by Lam. Credit: Dan Tham/CNN

Tang scans the characters onto his computer and then adjusts the shape of the strokes to create more uniformity. So far, he's digitized around 300 of Lam's Chinese characters, a process that took six months. He aims to convert up to 13,000 by the end of the project, which could take more than five years.

On a stroll near the Ruins of St. Paul's, Lam and Tang point out the signage that carries Lam's trademark style. Pausing in front of a barber shop, the two are greeted by the storeowner. They explain that Lam had written his storefront sign. The three men step back and admire his handiwork.

For Tang, these kinds of traditional signs do more than convey information to passersby. They can help to define a city's aesthetic and cultural identity.

""Certain things here (in Macao) are slowly fading away,"" Tang says, ""Like Mr. Lam's signs. If we don't take action to preserve his font now, there might not be an opportunity in the future.""",2020-07-14,https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/artisans-macao-typography-signs/index.html
Zahra Jamshed,"'Like the tart, I never change': The secret behind Macao's most famous dessert","Macao (CNN) — You can smell it before you see it. The sweet smell of sugar, egg and custard, baking til it's cooked just right. Flaky pastry on the outside, soft custard on the inside, and crispy, burnt, sugar on top.

It's the signature smell of Margaret's Café e Nata -- one of the most popular places to eat in Macao, a former Portuguese colony.

The cafe is especially famous for one thing: the Macanese egg tart. It's a sweet pastry inspired by its Portuguese and Chinese counterparts, made fresh daily by owner Margaret Wong.

If visitors aren't there for a treat from the bakery, chances are they're there to see Wong.

After three decades in the food business, she's a colorful personality who still spends every day working hard at the cafe. She can be spotted working the cash register or bustling about in the kitchen.

Few people know Macanese egg tarts better than Wong, who began making the dish 30 years ago with her late ex-husband Andrew Stow.

The couple founded their first bakery business, Lord Stow's, in 1989. Today, Lord Stow's is run by their daughter Audrey and Andrew's sister Eileen.

Margaret's Café e Nata, which she subsequently founded in 1992, is entirely run by Wong herself.

Some online reports suggest that Wong founded her cafe to compete with Lord Stow's -- which netizens claim was born as a result of a domestic feud following the couple's divorce.

She wouldn't comment on the rumors, though she spoke openly about the early days of their romance.

""We were married three times -- once in Hong Kong, once in England and once in a church,"" she says.

According to Wong, the couple met in a local church, where she played the organ.

""One day my foster mother was visiting from America, and we bumped into Andrew, who gave me a hug and a kiss and I went all red. He was friends with everybody so I didn't think I was anything special ... but my mother said 'Margaret, I think this is the right one for you.'""

The two were married in 1988.

Up to 10,000 tarts a day

Together, the couple created their signature egg tart dish, which is now an iconic Macao dish. Purists argue this egg tart tastes nothing like its Portuguese or Chinese counterparts.

According to Wong, that's the point.

""When we started our bakery, someone asked Andrew to make a pasteis de nata, because they were very popular in Portugal. The first tray came out burnt and wrong, and Andrew wanted to throw them away. I said, hold on, they're edible, so let people just try them. They tried one, and then two, and by the third I said, 'I have to charge you because clearly, it's good!' ""

It's this same recipe, three decades later, that continues to be sold across Macao.

Today, hundreds of tourists and locals alike line up at her cafe for a bite of this now famous pastry.

Wong's cafe alone can make up to 10,000 tarts a day -- all of which are bound to sell out.

""Sometimes people walk in and say -- can I have just one egg tart -- and I say, not even one bite.""

'Like the tart, I never change'

Every single dish sold by the bakery is graced with Wong's magic touch. In addition to egg tarts, other items on the menu include brownies, cakes and croissants. There's also a salad and sandwich bar.

Despite long working hours, and the physically demanding nature of her work, she still spends almost every day bouncing back and forth between the kitchen and the shop.

""Some of my staff have been working with me for 15 years, they know everything, but still sometimes I have to make sure everything is good -- I'm the boss!"" she says.

She's the boss, but she's also a local celebrity. During our interview Wong is regularly interrupted by friends and fans dropping by to wish her well.

Clearly young at heart, Wong abruptly cuts our interview short, informing us she needs to head to a rock 'n' roll dance class -- but leaves us with a taste of wisdom.

Dean Irvine,Tokyo transformed: Global sporting events put spotlight on Japan's capital,"(CNN) — With Tokyo set to host two of the world's biggest sporting events -- the Rugby World Cup and the 2020 Summer Olympics -- Japan's capital is making final preparations for the global spotlight.

So what will sports fans notice when they travel here?

First of all, they won't be alone.

Tourism in Tokyo is already booming. Annual foreign visitor arrivals to Japan trebled in the years from 2013 to 2018 to over 31 million, with around 10 million stopping in Tokyo. That's supposed to top 40 million in 2020.

However, unlike other destinations in Japan that are visibly struggling to cope with the influx, Tokyo, thanks to its size and a series of measures to prepare for the deluge, has so far been able to absorb them.

Rugby World Cup kicks off this week

The city's Olympic readiness will get a test run when the Rugby World Cup kicks off on September 20 at Tokyo Stadium. Matches will be held in 12 Japanese cities and around 600,000 international rugby fans are expected to descend on the country, taking one third of tickets.

Most of those will be from rugby heartlands: the British Isles, France, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. The organizers have promised that all the basics for an exciting and welcoming experience are in place, with 13,000 volunteers, many with English-language skills, on hand on match days.

Tokyo Stadium itself is around 18 kilometers to the west of what can be considered the central part of the city, though there are two official fan zones at the Tokyo Sports Square and Chofu Station Square/Chofu City Green Hall.

Unless Japan is playing, local pubs, known as izakayas, are more likely to be watching the culmination of the baseball season or variety shows on TV than rugby.

This is where some businesses are looking to fill the gap, such as the Hub group of British-style pubs and ANA Intercontinental Hotel Group.

Both are making efforts to target foreign visitors and local sports fans with promotions and fan-theme areas in their bars and hotels to watch live broadcasts of the matches.

""What I most expect is that we will have many foreigners who understand pub culture (because it's originally their culture) and they enjoy chatting and watching sports,"" says Tsuyoshi Ota, president of Hub.

While the sport is growing in the country and Japan's national team, known as ""The Brave Blossoms"" notched a huge win in the tournament against South African four years ago, it still remains niche.

""I think locals will find something big is going on in September seeing so many foreigners and they will give foreigners a warm greeting. I don't think most local people realize that so many people are coming to Japan for the Rugby World Cup,"" says Ota.

Tokoyite and sports fan Kensuke Tezuka also thinks that once the event gets going the atmosphere and local interest level will change.

""Japanese people tend to be quiet in daily life but we get cheerful and friendly in omatsuri (festival) occasions. I remember the 2002 football World Cup. Shibuya Crossing was very lively. The visitors come to Tokyo for a once-in a-lifetime occasion, so they are naturally excited. They will provide a great vibe.""

The 'Olympics effect'

l e v a r t

Japan's government expects the ""Olympics effect"" will bring approximately an extra 10 million visitors to the country in 2020.

It's an opportunity to showcase Tokyo to the world and the country isn't taking it lightly. Earlier this year, the city's governor, Yuriko Koike, told media the city was poised for ""dramatic change.""

""This year, 2019, will be key in making those Games a success and ushering in a new Tokyo,"" said Koike.

Major developments now underway include the Takanawa Gateway -- the first new station build on Tokyo's key JR Yamanote train line since 1971 -- which is due to open next year.

Featuring a steel-and-glass roof inspired by traditional Japanese origami, it's located between Tamachi and Shinagawa Stations and was designed by architect Kengo Kuma, who is also behind the new National Stadium being built for the 2020 Tokyo Games.

The area around Shibuya Station is also being revamped as part of a huge multi-year makeover to cement it as the city's entertainment, transport and business hub for decades to come.

This includes the new Shibuya Scramble Square, a 230-meter high mixed-use skyscraper located directly above Shibuya Station, with indoor and outdoor observation decks. It's due to open for business November 1.

Another hotly anticipated opening in this neighborhood is the Meiji Jingu Museum -- also by Kengo Kuma. Due to open in late October, it sits next to Yoyogi Park and is designed to blend into its wooded surroundings while showcasing important cultural artifacts.

Other changes of note include wider free wifi coverage not just in Tokyo but in the entire country -- including 108 Shinkansen ""bullet train"" stations.

To assist with language barriers while dining, the Tokyo government has launched a special location-based website that highlights restaurants with multilingual menus.

New Olympics sporting venues

In terms of Olympic sporting action, 30 events will be taking place at 43 venues, with the soon-to-be-finished New National Stadium as the centerpiece.

Located on the site of the main stadium for the 1964 Olympics, it's just a few kilometers from areas of the city popular with foreign visitors such as Shibuya, Shinjuku, Ginza and Roppongi.

On top of that, 10 public locations including Yoyogi and Hibiya parks will broadcast events, while a cohort of 80,000 volunteers -- many of them English-speaking -- will guide visitors, meaning the city should be well prepared.

Visiting sports fans with tickets will also find themselves near Tokyo Bay. It's not a traditional tourist area, but one developed for the Olympics and Paralympics.

It will host 17 sporting venues and the Olympic Village, where humanoid robots will reportedly be available to offer directions to nearby accommodations and attractions.

Book those hotel rooms now

According to real estate services company CBRE, an additional 30,000 hotel rooms are predicted to be available in Tokyo by 2020, compared to 2017, bringing the total to around 120,000.

Among the most anticipated is the Okura Tokyo, which has just reopened following extensive renovations that kicked off in 2015.

The original Hotel Okura Tokyo main building opened in 1962 and quickly became a global favorite by offering a mix of traditional Japanese culture with world-class service. After four years of rebuilding work, it has reopened as the Okura Tokyo and offers 508 luxury rooms in two buildings.

However, many more rooms are expected to be needed to cope with the influx of Olympic visitors.

Stricter requirements on locals looking rent spare rooms in their homes, through sites such as Airbnb, and few budget hotel options in the city means that planning and booking as far in advance as possible is strongly advised.

Other stresses are predicted, both for visitors and locals.

While most signage in stations and on public transport in the capital is already in Japanese and English, the influx will put more pressure on the city's infrastructure, particularly the full-to-bursting Metro and other train lines, which visitors will be using just like the city's commuters.

But counter measures are being planned so Olympic spectators and 'salary men' and 'office ladies' don't make each other's journey even more of a squeeze.

For instance, one initiative underway is encouraging businesses to allow shift- and tele-working by its employees -- a concept still hard to digest in Japan's rigid work culture where employees works some of the longest hours in the world.

Kate Springer,The story behind Vietnam's 'Crazy House',"(CNN) — Wild, weird, wonderful... there are many ways to describe the Crazy House (also known as Hang Nga Guesthouse) in Dalat, a relaxed mountain resort town in southern Vietnam

One thing's for sure: This ""crazy"" complex is one of a kind.

Standing in stark contrast to Dalat's French colonial villas, the bizarre avant garde guesthouse is a maze of spiral staircases, sculptural bedrooms, undulating surfaces, swirls of bright colors, narrow bridges and hidden nooks.

The artist behind the structure, 79-year-old Dang Viet Nga, says it's the ultimate expression of her imagination.

""Crazy House is a culmination of my life and creativity -- it all came together in this structure,"" Dang, daughter of Vietnam's former general secretary Truong Chinh, tells CNN Travel

""I wanted to create something original, pioneering -- different from anything else in the world.""

An exercise in creativity

After earning a PhD in architecture in Moscow, Dang worked for several years in Russia then moved to Hanoi, where she worked on government projects.

On a business trip to Dalat, Dang says she fell in love with the lush landscape, cooler climate and kind people and hoped to eventually move there.

In 1983, she relocated to Dalat with her then 8-year-old son, Nguyen Viet Thang.

After years of working on state-owned developments, which afforded little creativity, she felt compelled to unleash her imagination.

The Crazy House has 10 guest rooms, each named after an animal or plant. Courtesy Crazy House

In February 1990, she drew up plans for Crazy House. But instead of blueprints, she created a series of paintings to communicate her fantastical vision.

As a form of expressionist architecture, the house has no right angles but rather organic forms that are designed to mirror natural elements, like mushrooms, shells, caves and spiderwebs.

Dang Viet Nga, artist “Crazy House will never really be finished. It's like a living thing. It is always changing.”

""With this form, you have to try to free your mind,"" she says. ""There are no rules -- aside from basic structural principles [to make sure it's safe and stable] -- it's all about self-expression.""

When it came time to construct the house, Dang used various types of materials, including steel, wood and concrete.

""My mother used a lot of concrete because it's inexpensive and very easy to play with,"" says her son Nguyen, who is now 44.

""Since she can create whatever shape she wants, it reflects what she is envisioning in her mind.""

Less than a year later, the guesthouse was open for business and welcoming its first guests.

Closer to nature

Today, Crazy House feels like woodland fantasy brought to life.

""I felt that, over the last century, people have really destroyed nature. Not just in Vietnam, but around the world,"" says Dang. ""So I wanted to create a structure that brings people closer to nature.""

An elevated main house, which looks like it belongs in Hansel and Gretel, sits in the center of an open courtyard, surrounded by four enormous tree houses.

The Crazy House has been welcoming guests since 1991. Courtesy Crazy House

Sinuous cement ""branches,"" which double as bridges, twist and wind between the various houses so people can move from one to the next.

At first glance, the surreal structures recall mind-bending scenes from a Salvador Dali painting or perhaps even the organic works of modernist Catalan architect Antoni Gaudi.

The playful style continues within the tree houses, where 10 guest rooms -- each named after an animal or type of plant -- are full of organic shapes, cavern-like beds, and wooden seating areas.

""Reconnecting nature is one message that I want to communicate with the house,"" says Dang.

""But it's also a message to others to think outside of the box. Don't limit yourself by the rules and the expectations -- free your mind and let your imagination run wild.""

Following her own advice, Dang is continues to dream up new additions to the property while Nguyen now manages the business.

She is currently dreaming up two new gardens -- a Land Garden and a Sky Garden -- to add more greenery and flowers, as well as another tree house.

""I would say that Crazy House will never really be finished,"" says Nguyen. ""It's like a living thing. It is always changing.""

How to visit

In addition to staying in one of Crazy House's guest rooms, visitors can also tour the Dalat attraction for a fee. Though there's no restaurant, visitors can purchase drinks and snacks at a stall in the garden.",2020-07-14,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/crazy-house-dalat-vietnam/index.html

The livestock shows are just as much business events as they are social gatherings

(CNN) Every year, animal handlers travel throughout England and Wales to compete at agricultural shows.

Jooney Woodward's ""Best in Show"" is a documentation of those competitions, with photos that place a spotlight on the handlers and their animals.

""When you go to (the shows), they tend to be all about the animals -- people photographing the animals,"" Woodward said. ""I just wanted to turn my attention onto the people because they're so committed to what they do. They're really devoted and hardworking.""

While those involved with the competitions are the focus of many press photographers, Woodward's work stands out for its distinctive portraiture style.

""My work is a bit more composed. I use a medium-format camera and a tripod, so it is a bit more static in a way,"" she said. ""I think everybody is so proud of their animals that when I said to them that, 'I'd love a portrait of you and your cow,' everyone was more than willing to give up their time and help because they're so passionate about what they do.""

Allie Torgan,"From tourist to altruist, how a New Yorker embraced Vietnam","Hoi An, Vietnam (CNN) New Yorker Neal Bermas had traveled around the world, but Vietnam literally stopped him in his tracks.

There, the businessman saw starving children in Ho Chi Minh City while on a trip to Asia in 1999.

""There were bands of these poor, homeless kids on the streets ... and they were begging for milk, not for money,"" Bermas said. ""It stayed with me.""

Bermas, who did consulting for hotels and restaurants, saw there was an effort under way to help street kids get simple food service jobs. He realized he could help.

Combining his business savvy with an ambitious nonprofit model, in 2007 he co-founded STREETS International , based in Hoi An. The organization provides at-risk young people with a rigorous 18-month training program, preparing them for careers in Vietnam's booming culinary and hospitality industries.

""(They) come from the whole country with all kinds of very, very difficult paths,"" Bermas said. ""We offer them a structured program and a very rich apprenticing experience.""

STREETS' participants range in age from 16 to 22. The group provides housing, meals, medical care, clothing and support services to help trainees gain skills and confidence for employment at top resorts.

Some come from more than 600 miles away to participate in the free program. They receive a stipend and transportation assistance to visit their family.

""We build possibilities and aspirations for those communities,"" Bermas said. ""Where we take one young person from the village, suddenly ... the whole village starts to think about, 'maybe my kid, too.'""

Currently, 75 trainees are enrolled. The group's full-time staff and teachers are all Vietnamese, and Bermas often brings in chefs and other experts to enhance the training.

He and his team work with the government and ensure they follow all safety and labor laws and regulations.

By the end of this year, nearly 250 young people will have completed the program. Bermas said 100% of STREETS graduates have found employment, mostly at four- and five-star hotels in Vietnam.

""It works. And that's a push to do more to reach more young people,"" he said, adding that the group stays in regular contact with all graduates for at least two years after graduation, most longer.

Bermas plans to expand the program to other areas of the country.

CNN's Allie Torgan spoke with Bermas about his work. Below is an edited version of their conversation.

Bermas: All the young people in our program come from poverty -- without enough to eat, without electricity and plumbing. From leprosy villages, from HIV backgrounds; some have been trafficked, sometimes more than once.

Part of the process of selecting and getting to know the trainees is that we visit wherever they're from -- the home, in many cases the orphanage, the NGO, the isolated village, sometimes even a street corner. We want to know the most about them we possibly can, how difficult their conditions have been and how they have been wounded by life. Or what support there is. It's a great resource to a young person's development in our program.

This is the first real chance for many (of them) to transition from poverty and life on the streets to the dignity of self-sufficiency that comes with a successful career. You shouldn't discount a young person's future because of their past, no matter how dire it's been.

CNN: You've created an extensive program. Besides the hands-on culinary and hospitality training, what else is involved?

Bermas: There's a whole team of colleagues, educators and professionals who have worked developing all this. We have daily curriculums and lesson plans, from the first day to the last day -- designed to deliver quite sophisticated, substantive material.

We have a computer language lab. We have tutoring every day of the week. English language instruction is a big part. And a whole array of life skills, from hygiene to CPR, budgeting and banking, physical exercise and being healthy.

Depending on which track the trainees are going, they have classroom experience in a small teaching kitchen if they're becoming professional chefs, or in the classroom to learn about hospitality and service. And our three eateries have many purposes; each one brings a different set of skills for apprenticing.

CNN: You left Manhattan behind to do this. Why did you decide to move to Vietnam?

Bermas: The truth is, the early vision was that I would work with colleagues and assemble a team here. And I could travel back and forth and make sure everything was going well.

It became clear very early on that if I was to really realize this ambition on behalf of the young people in the program, I would have to be here and do it. It was probably the best, if not certainly the most meaningful, decision I've made in my adult life.

This work at STREETS is never easy, but it's important. I know now that I need to be sure there is a STREETS around 10 years from now.

CNN: You've kept your focus on the local community. How have they embraced you?

Bermas: It's traditional here in Vietnam when you open a new business that the business community and friends and family all send you large wreaths of flowers opening day to wish you good luck.

The day we opened the restaurant -- we'd been working so hard to open, to get this thing going -- and I came down the street, and there were so many of these big, beautiful wreaths full of flowers that said in Vietnamese, ""Congratulations"" and ""Welcome."" And who had sent them? All the local shops and friends we had made. I was so touched by this.

The flowers poured out into the street. It was amazing. I literally couldn't get in the front door of the restaurant.

Sugam Pokharel,Nepal's Organ Trail: How traffickers steal kidneys,"Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN) On the streets of Kathmandu, the sight of people begging for kidney treatment has become common.

The capital of Nepal is no different from many places in the world where aging populations, poor diets and no health insurance systems mean increased organ disease.

The organ in highest demand is the kidney and black market traffickers are meeting that demand. Up to 7,000 kidneys are obtained illegally every year, according to a report by Global Financial Integrity

Organ trafficking is an illegal, yet thriving trade around the globe.

That same report shows the illegal organ trade generates profits between $514 million to $1 billion a year.

In Kathmandu, we spotted a couple begging on the street for their son's kidney treatment.

Jeet Bahadur Magar and his wife spent their entire savings to treat their son's kidney disease.

Out of money and options, they are now out on the street hoping to raise enough funds to cover the medical bills.

""I pray to God that no one has to ever go through kidney failure problems,"" Jeet Bahadur said.

But many Nepalis do.

During our visit, Nepal Kidney Center in Kathmandu was packed with patients having dialysis -- a grueling four-hour process of purifying blood through a machine.

A patient can avoid the kidney transplant by having dialysis at least three times a week.

Those lucky enough to afford a transplant still face obstacles: the donor must match the blood group of the recipients and Nepali law requires the organ donor to be a family member.

Nepal's 'kidney bank'

We traveled to Kavre, a tiny district close to Kathmandu, and what activists and authorities say is a ground zero for the black market organ trade in Nepal.

Here, kidney trafficking rackets -- well organized and well funded -- dupe the poor and uneducated into giving away a piece of themselves.

The district has developed an unfortunate reputation as the ""kidney bank of Nepal.""

For more than 20 years, activists say, people from villages in Kavre have been the primary source of kidneys for sick and desperate patients throughout Nepal. But now the numbers are being tracked.

In the last five years more than 300 people have been reported to be victims of kidney traffickers in this district alone, according to Forum for Protection of People's Rights , a Kathmandu-based non-profit human rights organization. Some activists say the number is much higher.

""Social stigma and threats from traffickers keep many victims from coming forward,"" said Rajendra Ghimire, a human rights lawyer, and director of Forum for Protection of People's Rights.

'The meat will grow back'

Nawaraj Pariyar is one of the many victims of kidney traffickers.

Like many in Kavre, Pariyar makes a living from selling cattle milk and doing seasonal labor jobs on nearby farms. Poor and uneducated, all he has is two cows, a house and a tiny plot of land.

JUST WATCHED Victims tell their story. Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Victims tell their story. 01:01

Pariyar used to visit Kathmandu to find construction work. He was on a site in 2000 when the foreman approached him with a dubious offer: if he let doctors cut out a ""hunk of meat"" from his body, he would be given 30 lakhs -- about $30,000.

What he wasn't told: the piece of ""meat"" was actually his kidney.

""The foreman told me that the meat will grow back,"" Pariyar said.

""Then I thought, 'If the meat will regrow again, and I get about $30,000, why not?'""

""What if I die?"" Pariyar remembers asking the foreman.

The foreman assured Pariyar that nothing would happen. He was given good food and clothes, and was even taken to see a movie.

Then he was escorted to a hospital in Chennai, a southern state of India.

Traffickers assigned a fake name to Pariyar and told the hospital he was a relative of the recipient. The traffickers, Pariyar says, had all the fake documents ready to prove his false identity.

""At the hospital, the doctor asked me if the recipient was my sister. I was told by the traffickers to say yes. So I did,"" Pariyar said.

""I heard them repeatedly saying 'kidney'. But I had no idea what 'kidney' meant. I only knew Mirgaula (the Nepali term for kidney.)

""Since I didn't know the local language, I couldn't understand any conversation between the trafficker and the hospital staff.""

Pariyar was discharged and sent home with about 20,000 Nepali rupees -- less than one percent of the agreed amount -- and a promise he would have the rest shortly.

He never received any more money and never found the trafficker.

""After I came back to Nepal, I had a doubt. So, I went to the doctor. That's when I found out I am missing a kidney,"" Pariyar said.

Pariyar is now sick and getting worse by the day. He has a urinary problem and constant severe back pain.

But he cannot afford a trip to the doctor and is afraid he will die.

""If I die I can only hope for the government to take care of my two children. I don't know if I will die today or tomorrow. I'm just counting my days,"" Pariyar said.

Pariyar's experience is one of many similar stories we heard in Kavre.

Understanding the economic situation in this district is the key to understanding why so many people here easily fall prey to kidney traffickers.

There are hardly any other economic opportunities other than substantial farming and rearing livestock. One bad harvest or a big medical bill can easily ruin families.

""The main reason is poverty and lack of awareness. It is very easy for the traffickers to brainwash the villagers. Also, the villages in Kavre are close to the capital and are easily accessible,"" Ghimire said.

Indian links

Traffickers use proxies at different stages of the process. First, someone will approach the victim, another will create the donor's fake documents and then another will escort the donor to the hospital.

Few hospitals in Nepal perform kidney transplants. And even the doctors in Nepal know most well-heeled patients prefer to go across the border to India.

Two brothers who were duped by kidney traffickers show their scars

""They want better services, they want Indian doctors. That's why they go to the hospitals in India,"" said Dr. Rishi Kumar Kafle, Director of the National Kidney Center.

But activists have other explanations for the demand for Indian surgeries.

""It is hard to cross-check Nepali records across the border, so traffickers prefer to take the donors to India,"" Ghimire said.

We noted, before any kidney operation can be carried out in India, the hospital requires a No Objection Certificate, a letter drafted by the Nepali embassy in New Delhi confirming the donor as the kidney recipient's relative.

Photographs of the recipient and the relative, who would be the legitimate donor, were not included in the letter until recently.

Since Indian hospitals accept official Nepali documents, anyone could show up at the hospital, provide papers saying they were that person and have their kidney removed.

Activists say this is the loophole traffickers used for many years.

With the easy availability of forged documents, traffickers can beat the system.

While the Nepali government tries to tighten policies, Nepal's police officers are trying to crack down on the criminal rings.

Last year authorities arrested 10 people accused of organ trafficking in Kavre. Their case is still in court.

Sub-inspector Dipendra Chand, who led the police investigation, says stopping the underground trade is difficult.

""If we crackdown in one village, the traffickers simply move to another,"" Chand said.

Rajendra Ghimire says that the trafficking rings are now moving beyond Kavre.

""We have reports that this problem is expanding into other surrounding districts as well,"" Ghimire said.

The attention to this problem is growing in Kavre. Kidney trafficking stories are making headlines on the local and national newspapers.

But for victims like Pariyar and others, the media attention is too late.",2014-06-26,https://edition.cnn.com/2014/06/26/world/asia/freedom-project-nepals-organ-trail/index.html
Julie Guinan,Guatemala: Gender-based violence at epidemic levels,"(CNN) For 12 years Adelma Cifuentes felt worthless, frightened and alone, never knowing when her abusive husband would strike.

But as a young mother in rural Guatemala with three children and barely a third grade education, she thought there was no way out.

What began as psychological torment, name-calling and humiliation turned into beatings so severe Cifuentes feared for her life. One day, two men sent by her husband showed up at her house armed with a shotgun and orders to kill her. They probably would have succeeded, but after the first bullet was fired, Cifuentes' two sons dragged her inside. Still, in her deeply conservative community, it took neighbors two hours to call for help and Cifuentes lost her arm.

But the abuse didn't stop there. When she returned home, Cifuentes' husband continued his attacks and threatened to rape their little girl unless she left. That's when the nightmare finally ended and her search for justice began.

Guatamala's past still haunts

Cifuentes' case is dramatic, but in Guatemala, where nearly 10 out of every 100,000 women are killed, it's hardly unusual.

Many women in Guatemala's patriarcal socity are trapped in a cycle of violence.

A 2012 Small Arms Survey says gender-based violence is at epidemic levels in Guatemala and the country ranks third in the killings of women worldwide. According to the United Nations, two women are killed there every day.

There are many reasons why, beginning with the legacy of violence left in place after the country's 36-year-old civil war. During the conflict, atrocities were committed against women, who were used as a weapon of war. In 1996, a ceasefire agreement was reached between insurgents and the government. But what followed and what remains is a climate of terror, due to a deeply entrenched culture of impunity and discrimination. Military and paramilitary groups that committed barbaric acts during the war were integrated back into society without any repercussions. Many remain in power, and they have not changed the way they view women.

Some 200,000 people were either killed or disappeared during the decades-long conflict, most of them from indigenous Mayan populations. Nearly 20 years later, according to the Security Sector Reform Resource Centre, levels of violent crime are higher in Guatemala than they were during the war. But despite the high homicide rate, the United Nations estimates 98% of cases never make it to court. Women are particularly vulnerable because of a deep-rooted gender bias and culture of misogyny. In many cases, femicide -- the killing of a woman simply because of her gender -- is carried out with shocking brutality with some of the same strategies used during the war, including rape, torture and mutilation.

Explosion in violence

Mexican drug cartels, organized criminal groups and local gangs are contributing to the vicious cycle of violence and lawlessness. Authorities investigating drug-related killings are stretched thin, leaving fewer resources to investigate femicides. In many cases, crime is not reported because of fear of retaliation. Many consider the Guatamalen National Civil Police, or PNC, corrupt, under-resourced and ineffective. Even if a case does get prosecuted, according to Human Rights Watch, the country's weak judicial system has proved incapable of handling the explosion in violence.

Prevailing culture of machismo

Perhaps one of the biggest challenges facing women in Guatemala is the country's deeply rooted patriarchal society.

According to María Machicado Terán, the representative of U.N. women in Guatemala, ""80% of men believe that women need permission to leave the house, and 70% of women surveyed agreed."" This prevailing culture of machismo and an institutionalized acceptance of brutality against women leads to high rates of violence. Rights groups say machismo not only condones violence, it places the blame on the victim.

Make an impact: Help stop gender-based violence CARE provides medical, legal, psychosocial and protection services to those experiencing violence

U.S. National Committee for UN Women promotes social, political and economic equality for women and girls

The political will to address violence against women is slow to materialize.

""Politicians don't think women are important,"" says former Secretary General of the Presidential Secretariat for Women Elizabeth Quiroa. ""Political parties use women for elections. They give them a bag of food and people sell their dignity for this because they are poor.""

Lack of education is a major contributor to this poverty. Many girls, especially in indigenous communities don't go to school because the distance from their house to the classroom is too far.

Quiroa says ""They are subject to rape, violence and forced participation in the drug trade.""

Signs of progress

Although the situation for girls and women in Guatemala is alarming, there are signs the culture of discrimination may be slowly changing. With the help of an organization known as CICAM, or Centro de Investigación, Cifuentes was finally able to escape her husband and get the justice she deserved. He is now spending 27 years behind bars.

Cifuentes is using her painful past to provide hope and healing to others through art.

Since 2008, she and four other abuse survivors known as La Poderosas, or ""The Powerful,"" have been appearing in a play based on their real life stories.

Five Guatemalan abuse survivors known as La Poderosas or ""The Powerful"" share their stories and help other women get support.

The show not only empowers other women and discusses the problem of violence openly, but it also offers suggestions for change. And it's having an impact. Women have started breaking their silence and asking where they can get support. Men are reacting, too. One of the main characters, Lesbia Téllez, says during one presentation, a man stood up and started crying when he realized how he had treated his wife and how his mother had been treated. He said he wanted to be different.

The taboo topic of gender-based violence is also being acknowledged and recognized in a popular program targeting one of Guatemala's most vulnerable groups, indigenous Mayan girls. In 2004, with help from the United Nations and other organizations, the Population Council launched a community-based club known as Abriendo Oportunidades, or ""Opening Opportunities"". The goal is to provide girls with a safe place to learn about their rights and reach their full potential.

Senior Program Coordinator Alejandra Colom says the issue of violence is discussed and girls are taught how to protect themselves. ""They then share this information with their mothers and for the first time, they realize they are entitled to certain rights.""

Colom adds that mothers then become invested in sending their daughters to the clubs and this keeps them more visible and less prone to violence.

The Guatemalan government is also moving in the right direction to address the problem of violence against women. In 2008, the Congress passed a law against femicide. Two years later the attorney general's office created a specialized court to try femicides and other violent crimes against women. In 2012, the government established a joint task force for crimes against women, making it easier for women to access justice by making sure victims receive the assistance they need. The government has also established a special 24-hour court to attend to femicide cases. On the global front, the International Violence Against Women Act was introduced in the U.S. Congress in 2007; it has been pending ever since. But last week the act was reintroduced in both the House and Senate. If approved, it would make reducing levels of gender-based violence a U.S. foreign policy priority.

Pehaps the most immediate and effective help is coming from International nongovernmental organizations, which are on the front lines of the fight against gender-based discrimination in Guatemala.

Adelma Cifuentes shares her story to empower women and bring about awareness of Guatemala's history of gender-based violence.

Ben Weingrod, a senior policy advocate at the global poverty fighting group CARE, says, ""We work to identify and challenge harmful social norms that perpetuate violence. Our work includes engaging men and boys as champions of change and role models, and facilitating debates to change harmful norms and create space for more equitable relationships between men and women.""

But the job is far from over. While there is tempered optimism and hope for change, the problem of gender-based violence in Guatemala is one that needs international attention and immediate action.

Cifuentes is finding strength through the theater and the support of other abuse survivors, which has allowed her to move forward. But millions of other women trapped in a cycle of violence are facing dangerous and frightening futures. For them, it's a race against time and help cannot come soon enough.",2015-04-02,https://edition.cnn.com/2015/04/02/world/iyw-guatemala-gender-violence/index.html
Alex Court,Family ties mix with fresh fruit on an island paradise,"Story highlights Mauritius' fresh fruit and veg market leader started on a small hold farm

The family started the islands' first dairy, and will open its sixth supermarket franchise

(CNN) Golden beaches and grand hotels can all be found in Mauritius, but there is much more to this island paradise.

The country, located some 500 miles east of Madagascar, has been attracting global investors for decades. But there is also a healthy local appetite for business development -- one of the many reasons the country has been hailed as an African success story.

One company demonstrating this entrepreneurial drive is fresh food suppliers SKC Surat.

""My father Sooklall Surat, started as a farmer with one hectare of land,"" says Suren Surat, who is now CEO of the company his father founded sixty years ago. ""The land was next to our house, where we lived. My father was the first grower at that time, the pioneer for growing strawberries and artichokes in Mauritius.""

Suren Surat has been part of the company from the beginning. The family had enough offspring to start a cricket squad, but the team dedicated its efforts towards business success.

Ben Church,"Coree Woltering runs almost 1,200 miles in record time","(CNN) You'd have forgiven ultrarunner Coree Woltering for taking some time off after a number of his races were canceled amid the global pandemic, but the 30-year-old had other ideas.

Not content with seeing his training go to waste, the athlete took on the crazy challenge of recording the fastest known time across the Ice Age Trail -- a historic footpath which runs through the state of Wisconsin, US.

Starting on June 1, it took Woltering 21 days, 13 hours, 35 minutes to run the 1,147 miles -- smashing the previous record by some five hours.

Such a feat of endurance was naturally not without its difficulties, but when things got tough, Woltering went back to basics.

""I can do anything for 10 seconds,"" he told CNN Sport. ""So you just break it down into 10-second intervals. You take 10 steps forward, and then you do it again and you do it again.

""If that doesn't work, then you just tell yourself left, right, left, right and that's what you just keep saying over and over and over.

""It sounds intense... but that's honestly what it's like. This trail is almost 1,200 miles and you just have to break it down into 10-second intervals.""

Coree Woltering completed the near 1,200 miles in record time.

A 'purpose to run for'

The run had been a long-term ambition for Woltering, but the attempt only became reality due to the unforeseen circumstances in the US.

Despite having relatively little preparation time, he set off with just a small support team in tow -- including his husband Tom.

Whether it was down to the lack of regular sport on television or simply the magnitude of the adventure, his run began to garner worldwide attention.

Fans were able to follow his run on a live tracker and he regularly updated posts to his blog and Strava account.

Although such attention came as a surprise, it was the perfect opportunity to raise money for the volunteers who maintain the trail, and for Feed America -- a charity which helps the most vulnerable people in the US.

Woltering is still aiming to raise $50,000 for the hunger-relief organization , which predicts more than 54 million people in the US could experience food insecurity this year as the virus continues to threaten the economy.

""I figured that if I give myself a bigger purpose to run for, then when things get really hard, it's going to make it easier to continue on,"" he said.

He says some parts of the historic route were beautiful.

Injuries and Mother Nature

If running the unfathomable distance in little over three weeks wasn't enough, Woltering had to deal with a number of obstacles.

Within the first few days, he was in a constant battle with Mother Nature and remembers having to take more than 40 ticks off his skin after running through one particular section.

He was also hampered by a frustrating ankle injury which resulted in him having to walk for a few days, threatening any realistic hope of breaking the record.

But giving up was never an option.

""I figured out that if I still walk for 22 hours a day and sleep for an hour, and do this for the next few weeks, I could still break the record,"" he said, remembering the bemused look on his crew's face as they scrambled to a chiropractor to help get the run back on track.

""We had a couple of days where I did walk from between 12 to 16 hours. I didn't cover the mileage that I needed to, but I was still able to keep my ankle moving.

""Finally, it got to the point where I could actually run again. That's the really cool thing about something being three weeks, where you can actually work through something.""

The 30-year-old had to deal with ticks during the early stages of the run.

Hamburgers and lasagna

Along with the challenges came moments he won't forget in a hurry.

Members of the local community would join him on sections of the route which cuts through some of the most beautiful places in the country.

Meeting a three-year-old boy who gave him tips for the road ahead still remains a highlight in a run fueled by ""gas station food"" and to the surprising soundtrack of heavy metal.

A meal of red velvet cupcakes and lasagna, cooked for him by a supporter, still lives fondly in his memory.

""I was eating and drinking condensed chicken soup, Spaghettios and was eating all this stuff cold, not even heating it up, just eating it cold on the side of the trail,"" he laughed, saying he consumed between 6,000 to 8,000 calories a day.

""It's pretty funny when you start to think about it because everyone thinks of running as being this super healthy sport and, in general, it actually is.

""But when you're doing something of this magnitude, you're just using whatever you can to keep going.""

George Floyd

Woltering's run not only coincided with the pandemic but also the widespread protests against racial injustices and police brutality.

George Floyd was killed just days before he started the run and it served as extra motivation when the going got tough.

Staying focused on the task ahead did become difficult with so much swirling around him but he felt it was the right thing to do.

""One of my goals has just been to bring more people of color into the sport, and also from the LGBTQ community. I believe that it's really important to have representation,"" he said.

""Hopefully when people see me in a magazine or in an ad for The North Face, some kid will see that and be like, 'Cool, there are people that look like me doing this sport' and then maybe want to try it.""

Woltering was helped by his husband Tom during the run.

Early years

Despite his obvious talent for long-distance running, Woltering started off more as a sprinter as a child.

He also played soccer and baseball through school but his love for running soon took center stage -- he would turn up purposely late for baseball practice so his coach would make him run as a punishment.

""I honestly had no idea that I'd ever be racing on trails or even running for The North Face,"" he said. ""I thought running a marathon was crazy, up until a few years ago.

""It had always been something I did to stay in shape for other sports when I was growing up, and then it just became the thing that I really enjoyed.""

He now has a frightening back catalog of ultramarathons and blistering times, which are a testament to both his physical and mental fortitude.

Mentality, he says, is the key to endurance events and he trains his mind us much as his body.

""Covering the mileage is not that hard, but it's how you mentally deal with the highs and lows that come with it,"" he said.

""If it's storming, and I know that I'm gonna be racing somewhere where it could be rainy, then I'll go out and run in the middle of a rainstorm. Things like that get you ready for what you're going to be facing.""

Although nothing is in the diary for the upcoming weeks, Woltering is keen to get back running once he's fully recovered.

He hasn't ruled out a return to Wisconsin either.

""I'd love to go back and do it again and go faster. I honestly think It can be done in probably 18 days, maybe even slightly faster than that. So I'd totally do it again,"" he said.",2020-07-14,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/14/sport/coree-woltering-ice-age-trail-ultrarunner-cmd-spt-intl/index.html
Christina Macfarlane,"Wimbledon: 'I absolutely experienced racism in and out of tennis,"" says Mal Washington","(CNN) MaliVai Washington is a ""little sad."" That's because he holds a 24-year record that he never expected to possess for so long -- he's the last African-American man to reach a grand slam final.

On July 7, 1996, Washington strode onto Centre Court beside Dutchman Richard Krajicek for the biggest match of his career: the Wimbledon final.

It was the first time two unseeded players had reached this final, which was also disrupted by an infamous streaker appearance just before the coin toss.

The match itself was over in 94 minutes with Krajicek needing only three sets to dismiss his opponent. But the feeling of being there on that day, on the cusp of history, lingers on for Washington.

""It's distressing. It's unfortunate and a little sad,"" Washington told CNN Sport as he reflected on that 24-year record and that it's also 45 years since a Black American last won Wimbledon.

""I'm surprised that we don't have more Americans, period, on the men's side, but also more Black men who are succeeding at a high level.""

Washington makes a forehand return against Todd Martin during their Wimbledon semifinal in July 1996.

'Like catching lightning in a bottle'

He says people underestimate just how difficult it is for a player of any colour to achieve the feat -- especially in the era of Roger Federer, Rafa Nadal and Novak Djokovic, the sport's Big Three.'

""It's like catching lightning in a bottle,"" says Washington. ""The last American man to reach the final of a major was in 2003, Andy Roddick ... I mean, that just shows you how difficult it is not just for people of colour, but for people in general to reach the final of a major.

""A lot of that has to do with, you know, someone named Federer and Nadal and Djokovic over the past 15 years.""

But it also has a lot to do with what he calls ""the numbers game.""

""A young Black boy who's five years old, 10 years old, can turn on the TV Saturday or Sunday during any college football or pro football season, and he can see a ton of players that look a lot like him. Guess what? That's his guy and that's who he wants to be. That's not necessarily the case at all with tennis on the men's side.""

The 51-year-old knows he was lucky. Like so many other professionals in the game, it was his father who introduced him to tennis at the age of five and instilled in him a work ethic so strong that he and three other siblings went on to play professionally.

But the experience of seeing other players that looked like him succeed, also had an impact, notably Frenchman Yannick Yoah, who won the French Open in 1983.

""I loved a guy like Yannick Noah ... I was asked to warm him up at the US Open when I was still a junior. And I thought it was like the coolest thing in the world.

""But I was worried about screwing it up and nervous I'd turned up at the wrong court. A few minutes before 6 p.m. I saw this sea of people coming towards the court.

""You could see his head and these dreadlocks and hear that French accent above the crowd walking towards me. We exchanged a few words; he said, 'I heard you're a promising young player, good luck.' It was a special moment for me.""

As a teenager, Washington was inspired by French tennis star Yannick Yoah.

'They didn't allow Black players at that particular club'

Not all of it was special. Growing up in a sport that was overwhelmingly White, Washington tried not to let the color of his skin dictate what he could achieve on court, though others did.

""I absolutely experienced racism in tennis and out of tennis. There were times growing up you'd play played [a] junior tournament of multiple age groups and you just kind of knew -- or were told -- you weren't going to play at that particular club. They didn't allow Black players at that particular club.""

But the worst examples of racism came through discrimination in the draw.

""You'll see a draw, 32 players let's say, and three of the players are Black ... And there were times where it was just kind of uncanny how two of the Black players faced each other in the first round, and then if you won, you were going to play the third Black person in the second round.

""And you're just thinking ... all right, it could have just been the luck of the draw? But then when it happens a few times it kind of makes you wonder -- OK, are they fixing the draw just to eliminate the Black players from the draw? I would argue that every Black tennis player at some point has seen that.""

Washington has set up a foundation to help bring tennis to underprivileged urban kids.

'Out of line'

As he progressed up the tennis ladder Washington says he was dealt with ""more integrity."" Even so the top level of tennis wasn't immune with a racial slur or joke occurring here and there.

""There were incidences that happened not ever necessarily with the tournament officials, but maybe someone who's working for the tournament ... various comments or jokes that they thought were kind of funny that I was thinking, all right, that's completely out of line,"" says Washington.

The ATP did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment.

Does he wish he would have said something at the time? ""Yes, I do,"" he replies.

""There's a part of me that wishes I had because it could have been an educational moment right there. But there's also a part of me that also says, you know what? I don't want to spend all my time trying to correct what I perceive as a racially-motivated event. That's not the best use of my time.""

So Washington used his time in a very different way. After reaching the final of Wimbledon -- a moment that would prove to be the summit of his career -- he decided to launch the MaliVai Washington Foundation to help bring tennis to underprivileged urban kids. He didn't need to look far to find the right spot.

""You go into this area of Jacksonville (Florida), the 32209 zip code. You go into that area. The last thing you expect to see is tennis. You'll see a group of kids on the court playing tennis, playing competitive tennis and just getting after it.""

Chairman of the Board and President of the USTA Jon Vegosen, MaliVai Washington, Billie Jean King, James Blake, First Lady Michelle Obama, Serena Williams and Katrina Adams participate in the Let's Move! tennis clinic during Day Twelve of the 2011 U.S. Open.

'Challenging economic situations'

In an area notorious for drug-related crime and murder, the Foundation quickly blossomed into a comprehensive after-school youth development program providing tennis, homework tutoring and life skills for low-income youth. As a result, graduation rates are high, teenage pregnancies are non-existent and crime rates low among the students who attend the Foundation.

""Oftentimes, kids are coming from very challenging economic situations,"" Washington explains. ""But that can't ever be their excuse for lack of success or lack of education or incarceration, because the Foundation -- that is your advantage.""

The Foundation's focus on tennis and education is something Washington's predecessor, Arthur Ashe, would approve of.

Ashe was not only the first Black man to win a grand slam -- three in total -- but during his career, he became a powerful activist for Black rights, as well as social and political issues.

Washington recalls sitting next to him at West Side Tennis Club at Forest Hills -- the original home of the US Open.

""I remember telling him that I was I was thinking about turning pro after my sophomore year...and this look kind of came on its his face, like 'I don't know whether you should do that.' But I don't think it was necessarily a reflection on me and my tennis, but more reflection about how much he valued education.""

Arthur Ashe won three grand slams.

At that point neither player would know Washington would go on to reach the final of Wimbledon in 96' -- and win the 'Arthur Ashe Humanitarian Award' in 2009 for his work with the Foundation.

""I think what I what I took from Arthur over the years is, as human beings and certainly as athletes who play on an international level, we have a responsibility to do more than just hit a tennis ball.

""And I'm going to paraphrase here in one of his books, he said: 'If I'm just remembered as a tennis player, I failed. I didn't do I didn't do my job.' That one line has always stuck with me and I've tried to in some ways live by that.""",2020-07-09,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/09/tennis/mal-washington-wimbledon-final-cmd-spt-intl/index.html
Matt Majendie,'Toto Wolff of Formula E' aims to make sparks fly for Mercedes,"(CNN) His boss might be famed Mercedes F1 chief Toto Wolff, but Ian James is bringing his own ""passionate"" approach as head of the marque's fledgling Formula E team.

The Briton has been tasked with turning Mercedes , the dominant force of Formula 1, into the front-runner in the electric racing series.

Its appearance in Formula E is down in no uncertain terms to a dramatic and very public U-turn by Wolff, who was an early skeptic of the series.

He even said at the team's unveiling he ""didn't believe that Formula E could make it.""

Now, though, Wolff is a fully fledged convert, and he turned to James to lead Mercedes' venture into electric motor sport.

Ian James in Riyadh at the start of the Formula E 2019-20 season.

James shuns comparisons with Wolff, but also aims to copy his boss.

""It's brilliant to work with someone like Toto,"" said James. ""At a race weekend, we speak on multiple occasions. His focus is Formula 1 but he is still very much involved in the Formula E programme.

""What I try to do is the same as Toto, which is holistic. I'm passionate about racing and making sure we're always moving in the right direction. He does that very well.

""He'll leave us to it but he offers great advice when it comes to drivers or analyzing what went wrong at a race and what could have been done better.""

Wolff v Wolff in Formula E

Ian James and Toto Wolff at the Mercedes-Benz EQ Formula E Team launch with the teams' drivers Nyck de Vries and Stoffel Vandoorne.

Despite Wolff's split interest and direction, James is adamant it will have no bearing on Lewis Hamilton or Mercedes' continued ambition to remain No.1 when the F1 season gets under way in Australia next month.

But the Austrian is not the only Wolff James has to deal with. Toto's wife Susie, team principal of the Venturi team , is a partner in using the Mercedes EQ powertrain but also a grid rival.

James laughs at the idea he might be caught in the midst of a Wolff vs. Wolff on-track battle. ""It's certainly a unique position to be in,"" he said. ""But it's great to have Susie on board as she's someone I can have a very open dialogue with.

""We know if we take the right approach and work collaboratively, we can develop both teams faster together. And it would be a dream if all four drivers are fighting for the top spots. Then it gets serious.""

Like Wolff, James' passion for motor sport growing up lay in F1, first getting hooked at the age of five or six.

For him, the standout early moment was spilling onto the circuit at Silverstone when Nigel Mansell won the 1991 British Grand Prix and famously gave rival Ayrton Senna a lift back to the pit lane after he ran out of fuel at the finish.

After studying mechanical engineering at university, James' first job came at McLaren working on the Mercedes Benz SLR McLaren for three and a half years before a switch to Mercedes where he has worked for the last 15 years.

'We're racers'

His roles have been multifarious: part of the team behind the introduction of KERs in 2011 and helping the returning Mercedes to a first victory the following season with Nico Rosberg. But he was also heavily involved in the powertrain development which led to the first world titles in 2014 and the ongoing dominance.

""I'm a jack of all trades, master of none,"" he said. ""I'm an engineer by trade but genuinely a bad one. I've had time in finance and marketing, in program management. It's been a mixed bag.

""And with this, I was lucky -- it was genuinely too good to turn down, not just getting back into motor sport which is a passion of mine but also the opportunity to start up a business.""

And like any motor sport business, the primary goal is winning.

""Internally, there's enough understanding and empathy that expectations are kept in check in our rookie year in a complex series,"" he said. ""But externally we're the team with the three-pointed star, one linked with great success in F1 and DTM before that.

""It takes time, look at F1 for example. But we want to win the competition as we're racers. The mid-term goal is to get into championship contention but we're aware how challenging that will be.

""Of all the things I've done, this will be very hard to top. We're at the start of this journey and making sure we bring the results and build up the business to make sure that it's ready for the future.""",2020-03-11,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/11/motorsport/toto-wolff-of-formula-e-spt-intl/index.html
Matias Grez,Why English football can't afford another 'lost generation' of Black coaches,"(CNN) It's widely accepted that English football lost a generation of influential Black players in the 1980s and 1990s, who might have become managers but never did.

Fast forward to the 21st century and just five of the current 91 (5.5%) managers and head coaches in England's top four divisions are from a Black, Asian or minority ethnic background.

Both the Premier League and the English Football League have backed players and coaches taking a knee in support of the Black Lives Matter movement in recent weeks, but that lowly statistic leaves both organizations looking more exposed.

Gestures are all well and good, but when push comes to shove, when will black coaches be able to showcase their talents from a position of power?

That lack of representation has now prompted the Premier League and EFL to launch a new scheme to help develop Black, Asian and minority ethnic coaches.

The new initiative -- which the Premier League says is ""aimed at increasing the number of Black, Asian and minority ethnic players moving into full-time coaching roles in the professional game"" -- will give six coaches per season a 23-month work placement at EFL clubs.

Darren Moore, manager of Doncaster Rovers, is one just five black coaches in English professional football.

The scheme will be jointly funded by the Premier League and Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) and the first six people will begin their placements at the start of the 2020-21 season.

On the face of it, the initiative seemed like a positive step; a move towards addressing the huge under representation of Black managers and coaches in the top four divisions of English football.

However, Troy Townsend, the Head of Development at anti-racism organization Kick It Out, admits to being ""a little bit underwhelmed"" by the new initiative and fears yet another generation of black players will be overlooked when it comes to getting jobs in management.

Other critics have labeled the new scheme as nothing more than adult work experience.

""We've been in this space before where we've spoken up about the lack of representation in coaching circles, but I'm not sure what this addresses,"" Townsend told CNN Sport.

'Frustration'

According to research carried out by Farenet in 2014, the proportion of Black, Asian and minority ethnic footballers in English professional football -- in first teams, academies and development squads -- since the early 1990s has been an estimated 30%.

The current figure for professional footballers in the UK is around 25%. However, those numbers have never been reflected in senior positions or positions of authority within the sport.

""There seems to be just an entry level for these coaches,"" adds Townsend of the new initiative. ""Six coaches over 23 months, the best part two years; it strikes a chord to me that will only go so far.

""I'm looking and wondering why it's only acceptable to have six coaches and why we cannot progress something that's rolled out right across the leagues and has a little bit more impact as well, so I'm holding fire on on it.

""There will be some coaches that want to go through that process, no doubt, because maybe they're not in the game. But there must be some who are looking at it and thinking: 'I've had the opportunities at this level and I want to try and pit my wits and find out what the highest level is like.'""

Wolverhampton Wanderers boss Nuno Espirito Santo is currently the only black manager in the Premier League.

Townsend, among others, has also questioned why the new initiative is limited to the 71 EFL teams and doesn't include the Premier League.

England's top tier does have its own program -- the Premier League Elite Coach Apprenticeship Scheme (ECAS) which launched in 2015 -- which it says ""complements"" the new EFL initiative.

Former professional footballer Iffy Onuora, who currently works as the equalities coach for the PFA, admits he ""gets the frustration"" of the scheme's critics but says even the best coaches in English football today had to cut their teeth in the lower leagues.

""If you look at even the foreign coaches, the big headline people like [Pep] Guardiola ... certainly [Jurgen] Klopp, who worked at Mainz, they had a grounding lower down in the Bundesliga [and La Liga],"" he tells CNN.

""Certainly that's where they get their first foot hold; you make your mistakes, you build your reputation and you go from there. So, realistically, for us that's the same thing. You go into an EFL club and you try and pick heads through that.""

The problem of under representation isn't only limited to coaching and managerial positions; it's also a problem in senior business and decision-making roles.

Currently, less than 1% of senior roles involved in the running of football clubs are held by an individual of a Black, Asian or minority ethnic background.

Among the few in English football are Les Ferdinand, who holds the position of Director of Football at Queens Park Rangers (one of the clubs the former England international played for), and Burton Albion chairman Ben Robinson, who has overseen the modest club's improbable rise through the football leagues.

While the new scheme perhaps provides a base to build from, Onuora is aware that it's just one part of large variety of issues around race that English football needs to tackle.

""I think this is a part of increasing the pipeline,"" Onuora says. ""It doesn't take away from the other things we need to do. We need to get black faces in the boardrooms, they are the decision makers at clubs. It's not a conversation in isolation, it's got to be a part of a wider picture.

""You gotta have people in the boardroom, you have to encourage the club and the stakeholders to open the doors, [make] transparent decisions. There's the old saying: 'You can't be what you can't see.'

""If the directors and CEO's can't see other directors or CEO's, or other people around them in their network who are people of color as well, then ... we've got very few Ben Robinson's in the boardroom.""

'Ignorance'

One of the five black managers currently in charge of a Football League club is Darren Moore, who has been at third-tier Doncaster Rovers for just under a year.

Moore is a member of the Premier League's Black Participants' Advisory Group -- which was launched last year to ""ensure the views of Black, Asian and minority ethnic players and coaches are heard"" -- and will be offering his support and expertise to the six participants and the clubs involved in the new scheme.

Like Onuora, Moore says he understands the frustrations people have looking in from the outside, but believes even just the announcement of the scheme is already having a positive effect.

Since it was launched, he says his phone and been ringing with coaches wanting to sign up or asking for more information.

""It's a real start and this scheme gets the individuals hands on,"" Moore tells CNN. ""It's a start; six places better off than we were yesterday or the day before. For me, if the group, if the system works ... then I'm sure more EFL coaches will open up to what we are doing.

""It's six places every season. What if we are sitting a year from now and those six places have gone well, that it doubles or it even triples? That means we started from somewhere.

""So, yes, there is going to frustration. Yes, I have illustrated before it's not the be all and end all in terms of fixing the problem, but it is a scheme that has to be looked at as a positive going forward.""

'Rooney Rule'

At the EFL's general meeting last June, it was announced that the 'Rooney Rule' would be officially introduced after an 18-month trial period.

Named after NFL diversity committee chairman Dan Rooney, it requires clubs to interview at least one Black, Asian and minority ethnic candidate for vacant managerial or senior club operation positions.

However, Townsend believes the lack of data available -- the number of black coaches applying, those who reach the interview stage and are turned down and what the process is like for them -- makes the EFL's 'Rooney Rule' difficult to judge.

Townsend says this lack of information leads to one of the biggest frustrations he faces: people asking him if black coaches are even applying for jobs.

""There's a certain amount of ignorance, not only in this game, but in society in general,"" he says. ""When that question gets asked, I chuckle a little bit and I kind of say to myself: 'Well, I cannot continue to keep answering the same questions over and over and over again.'

""I've been privy to a list of all the black coaches that are qualified, that are able, that could go into the industry; not just in the academy environment and not just in the EFL, and I would hope would be able to cut their teeth at a high level. There are many other people that have been privy to that as well.

""So those noises normally come from people who have no appreciation and understanding of the coaching circles and they'll probably continue to exist, but there are a plethora of coaches out there that could be working in the industry and are struggling.

""And maybe we might lose a generation, again, of those good coaches because they just feel that the opportunities are not there for them.""

While Moore accepts the lack of black coaches is unacceptable, he believes the new scheme a first step towards ensuring this same conversation of under representation isn't being had in the future.

""The numbers are alarming, yes they are, let's not go away from the fact that there are currently five that are serving within the game,"" Moore says. ""What I will say to you now is that there are many, many more from the outside serving.

""We are working extremely hard to bring the rest of those people into the game. As I said before, there are many, many talented [coaches] from the Black and Asian community that are outside the game, that need to be inside the game. Not only that, but I individually know that there's a thirst and a hunger for them to serve the game.

""The wonderful thing that we are trying to do now is create platforms where there is more visibility and there's more opportunities inside the professional game. There's more of a movement globally and in the country to see this change.""",2020-07-08,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/08/football/black-asian-and-minority-ethnic-coaching-scheme-english-football-premier-league-spt-intl/index.html
Emma Reynolds,English rugby union bosses reviewing slave-era song used as chant,"(CNN) England rugby union bosses are reviewing the use of the slave-era song ""Swing Low, Sweet Chariot"" as a chant by fans, saying many may not be aware of its ""historical context.""

The Rugby Football Union (RFU) did not immediately respond to CNN but in a statement released to British media the organization said it was determined to ""accelerate change and grow awareness,"" as the Black Lives Matter movement prompts corporations and institutions to rethink how they operate.

In recent weeks following George Floyd's death , a number of British organizations , such as the Bank of England, and businesses have been reviewing their historical associations with slavery.

""The RFU has stated we need to do more to achieve diversity and we are determined to accelerate change and grow awareness,"" the governing body said in a statement.

""The Swing Low, Sweet Chariot song has long been part of the culture of rugby and is sung by many who have no awareness of its origins or its sensitivities.

""We are reviewing its historical context and our role in educating fans to make informed decisions.""

English rugby union fans at the HSBC London Sevens at Twickenham Stadium on June 2, 2018 in London.

Former England rugby union player Maggie Alphonsi spoke out about why she no longer sings the song, writing on Twitter : ""I will NEVER stop using my voice!!""

Brian Moore, a former English rugby union player and commentator said : ""The world has moved on and, rightly, things that were normal then should not necessarily be normal now ... It should be celebrated in its rightful context.""

But former England cricket captain Michael Vaughan posted a news story about the issues around the song on Instagram with the caption: ""Please tell me if I am wrong ... but this surely can't be right !!??""

Is it right for rugby fans to sing a slave-era song?

The song ""Swing Low, Sweet Chariot"" is one of the most recognized African-American spirituals. Revered, emotive, and rooted in the horrors of US slavery and the oppression of race.

But for the last three decades, the familiar melody has also been the adopted anthem of England's rugby union team, its haunting chorus a common echo in stadiums where the national team plays.

And therein lies the problem.

Cornell Brooks, President of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).

Should lyrics which are about suffering and despair be sung by thousands of England fans who are often middle-class, often White?

""A slap in the face to the history of slavery,"" Cornell William Brooks, then president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), described the use of this spiritual in a sporting arena. Brooks is now Hauser Professor of the Practice of Nonprofit Organizations and Professor of the Practice of Public Leadership and Social Justice at the Harvard Kennedy School.

Lord Herman Ouseley, chairman of anti-racism group Kick it Out in 2017, said singing ""Swing Low, Sweet Chariot"" to cheer a rugby team was a matter of ""ignorance, lack of sensitivity and arrogance,' while American academics have called it cultural appropriation

Three years ago, when asked by CNN whether the RFU would be reviewing the use of ""Swing Low, Sweet Chariot,"" an spokesperson for English rugby's governing body said: ""Swing Low has been associated with rugby and rugby clubs for decades. It is sung by fans to get behind the England rugby team.""",2020-06-19,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/19/sport/swing-low-chant-england-rugby-slavery-gbr-spt-intl/index.html
Ben Morse,Jack Johnson: Black boxer who sparked race riots after world heavyweight win,"(CNN) Global protests sparked by George Floyd's death at the hands of police in Minneapolis are likely never to be forgotten, but less well known are the race riots that flared across the US 110 years ago.

Those riots weren't sparked by police brutality, but by a boxing match.

In 1908, Jack Johnson became the first Black heavyweight boxing champion of the world, fighting at a time when, despite slavery having been abolished 45 years previously, African Americans were still subjected to widespread segregation and racism.

His victory over James J. Jeffries -- in what was billed then as the ""Fight of the Century"" -- on Independence Day in 1910, sent shockwaves through both the Black and White communities across the world

The bout was fought in Reno, Nevada, at the height of the Jim Crow laws era, when racial segregation in the US South was rigorously enforced.

A former undefeated heavyweight champion, Jeffries came out of retirement to ""to make an effort to reclaim the heavyweight championship for the White race."" He added : ""I should step into the ring again and demonstrate that a White man is king of them all.""

Johnson's subsequent victory sparked race riots across the US, pitching a Black community -- jubilant that their champion had won -- against their White counterparts, seething with anger at the outcome of the fight. More than 20 people were killed and hundreds were injured. Most of the victims were Black.

In part due to his refusal to fight Black contenders after beating Jeffries, an extravagant lifestyle and his feud with Joe Louis , Johnson managed to somewhat alienate himself from the Black community and subsequently become something of a forgotten figure.

It wasn't until the rise of Muhammad Ali -- who recognized many similarities between himself and Johnson -- and the arrival of the Black Power era that his career and achievements became more widely appreciated, not just for his sporting prowess but for his trailblazing success in an era when racism was widespread and commonplace.

According to Theresa Runstedtler -- author of 'Jack Johnson, Rebel Sojourner: Boxing in the Shadow of the Global Color Line' -- the boxer's defeat of Jeffries ""ripped the veil off of the niceties that were used to cover up the violence of White supremacy.""

""[Johnson's rise to champion] signified Black possibilities at a moment when all of the regular channels of Black success, whether it be trying to get a quality education or trying to make it in business or even just trying to be involved in politics -- because there was so much widespread disenfranchisement -- this was an example of a success that couldn't be disputed,"" Runstedtler told CNN Sport

""That he had defied social barriers to become the best at something when all of these other barriers were being put up in front of African Americans seeking to improve their social status, symbolically, he was super important.""

Johnson faces Jeffries in the ""Fight of the Century"" in 1910.

Reaching the pinnacle

Perhaps what's even more remarkable about Johnson's success is that he was raised by two former slaves.

""To know that somebody in an era of just the most appalling racism decided as a very young boy that he was going to be something unique and special and then set out to do that is, people talk about the American dream, which is largely a myth, but he embodies it,"" according to Geoffrey C. Ward, author of 'Unforgivable Blackness: The Rise and Fall of Jack Johnson.'

As a Black fighter, he was predominately restricted to facing only Black opponents -- he fought Jeffries' younger brother in 1902 -- competing under the confines of the 'Colored Heavyweight Championship of the World' category which he won in 1903. At the time in some areas of the USA, interracial boxing was banned.

Johnson was the first African American to hold the world heavyweight boxing title when he beat Canadian Tommy Burns in Sydney, Australia.

However, then-current world heavyweight champion Tommy Burns was more open-minded, promising to defend his title against ""all comers, none barred. By this I mean Black, Mexican, Indian or any other nationality without regard to color, size or nativity.""

Burns initially wanted ""to give the White boys a chance"" first -- but Johnson finally got his shot and he took it with both hands.

In 1908, in front of a crowd of 20,000, Johnson was handily beating Burns in Sydney, Australia, before police stopped the fight in the 14th round to prevent Johnson from knocking out his opponent. Nevertheless, Johnson's victory was secure, making him the first-ever Black heavyweight boxing champion.

Given the widespread racial animosity within the American population, largely White media outlets sent out the call for a ""Great White Hope"" to steal the title from Johnson.

After successfully defending his title three times on US soil -- he also drew with Philadelphian Jack O'Brien -- Jeffries, who had since retired to an alfalfa farm, answered the call for a boxer to ""demonstrate the superiority of the White race,"" Ward says.

Jeffries -- who hadn't fought for five years -- said upon accepting the fight: ""I am going into this fight for the sole purpose of proving that a White man is better than a negro.""

James J. Jeffries was once considered one of the greatest heavyweight champions of all time.

'Fight Of The Century'

And so on July 4, 1910, in a bespoke, 22,000 capacity stadium in downtown Reno in front of an entirely White crowd, Jeffries went toe-to-toe with Johnson in what turned out to be as one-sided a heavyweight title clash as you are ever likely to see.

The quicker, more agile Johnson easily evaded Jeffries' lumbering attacks, knocking him down twice. Finally, during the 15th round Jeffries' corner threw in the towel.

""They basically begged [Jeffries] to come out of retirement, pump up his ego and make him think he's gonna win, and he just fails miserably at that,"" Runstedtler said.

Jeffries indicated after the fight his time out of the ring meant he was no longer able to compete with ""The Galveston Giant."" ""I am not a good fighter any longer,"" he said . ""I could not come back. Ask Johnson if he will give me his gloves.""

The result of the fight shocked those in attendance. While Johnson and his team celebrated in the ring, the audience streamed out of the stadium in eerie silence, according to Runstedtler.

Around the US though, the reaction wasn't so muted, with Johnson's victory sparking race riots across many states.

The bout was one of the first fights ever to be filmed, meaning that there was a celluloid record for all to watch. However, just days after the fight, many states and cities banned showings of the Johnson-Jeffries film.

Indeed, two weeks after the fight, former US President Theodore Roosevelt, who himself was a boxing fan, wrote an op-ed in which he supported the banning of moving pictures of boxing matches, hoping that the Johnson-Jeffries bout was ""the last prize fight to take place in the United States.""

From White officials in the US to colonial officials in the British empire , moves were made to prohibit the circulation of the film.

Said Runstedtler, ""[They] were terrified about what this film would do to the delicate balance of power in their spaces where, in particular in the British case, often they were outnumbered by people of African descent.

""There was a huge build-up around it and so it wasn't just the fight itself, and the victory on that day, but the reverberations of it across the rest of the US and the world.""

'A very flamboyant, ostentatious personal presentation'

Outside of the ring, Johnson's lavish lifestyle -- notably his collection of expensive cars -- often alienated him from what people at the time perceived to be a ""respectable"" image of Black leaders of the day, embodied by the term ""Talented Tenth,"" popularized by W.E.B. Du Bois.

""If you've looked at any of the photos of him, he had a very flamboyant, ostentatious personal presentation at a time when African Americans were seen by the rest of society as manual laborers or workers,"" Runstedtler explained.

""He was known to hang out in the vice districts of Chicago and other cities where he traveled and to cavort with the sporting crowd, the gamblers, the pimps, the prostitutes, etc.""

His relationships with Black boxers after he became world heavyweight champion also didn't help. One of his Black challengers at the time, Joe Jeannette said : ""Jack forgot about his old friends after he became champion and drew the color line against his own people.""

Johnson's feud with Joe Louis, world heavyweight champion from 1937 to 1949 and one of the greatest heavyweight boxers of all time, further tarnished his reputation.

Future Black fighters often tried to distance themselves from Johnson as they tried to become ""paragon's of Black middle class respectability,"" according to Runstedtler.

""He bet against [Louis], he hoped Billy Conn would beat him, he hoped Max Schmeling would beat him,"" Ward noted.

""And after the first Schmeling fight in 1936 (which Louis lost), he went down on 120 Fifth Street in Harlem and showed off all the money that he had won betting against Joe Louis and the police had to rescue him from the crowd.""

It wasn't until long after Johnson's death in 1946 that people started to revisit his story and the effect that he had on society, primarily because of the success of Ali and the legendary heavyweight's own interest in Johnson's life.

After going to see ""The Great White Hope"" -- a Broadway show based on Johnson's life, starring James Earl Jones in the lead role -- in 1968, Ali told Jones: ""That's my story. You take out the issue of White women and replace it with the issue of religion. That's my story!""

At that time, Ali's refusal to fight in Vietnam after converting to Islam had resulted in his boxing license being suspended and the government taking hold of his passport. These struggles he faced were the reasons why he saw so many similarities between him and Johnson's plights.

As a result, in subsequent fights, Ali's cornerman, Drew ""Bundini"" Brown, could be heard shouting: ""Ghost in the house! Ghost in the house! Jack Johnson's here! Ghost in the house!"" to encourage Ali.

Johnson (right) faces Jeffries in Reno, Nevada.

""People within the Black community, particularly Black men, revisited his image and said: 'Wow, this guy just did whatever the heck he wanted,'"" Runstedtler said. ""And he embodied the kind of powerful Black masculinity that appealed to people during the Black Power era.""

The Black Power movement began in the 1960's in which activists ""boldly challenged the hatred and violence of an intractable system of racism and oppression,"" the author Joyce Marie Bell wrote

Ali's revisiting of Johnson's story helped catapult the one-time world champion -- who had had his title stripped because of his refusal to be drafted into army service to fight in the Vietnam War -- back into the public's consciousness and also create a lineage of great Black heavyweight boxers.

Even Lennox Lewis -- three-time heavyweight world champion -- said that he would ""never forget that I stand on the shoulders of Jack Johnson.""

""To be honest, I knew more about Muhammad Ali,"" Lewis told the Guardian in 2010. ""He was in our time. But I learned about Jack Johnson. Ali's contribution was profound, but Jack Johnson's was the first. It was quite a story. I am a lover of history and it was good to look again at the sort of attitudes that were about back in those days, to see how far we have come.

""Even though Black people were, in some ways, more accepted in American culture, the promoters' dream became to look for controversy. And Jack Johnson was the first great showman.

""He gave them what they wanted. Look at the time he lived. It was remarkable that he was travelling the world, as a Black man, getting arrested, leaving America, going to Europe. In the end he got old, like we all do, and he got knocked out by Jess Willard.""

Johnson became world heavyweight champion in 1908.

The pardon

In 1913, Johnson was convicted for violating the Mann Act for transporting women across state lines for immoral purposes.

Johnson fled to Europe in 1913 while free on appeal. But after years of fights overseas, including the eventual loss of his title in Havana, Cuba, in 1915, Johnson came home where he eventually turned himself over to U.S. authorities at the Mexican border in 1920 and served 10 months in prison.

While the law had found him guilty of transporting Belle Schreiber across state lines, his Mann Act conviction was clearly ""meant as a lesson to the Black folk, the world around.""

Following a long campaign initiated by documentary maker Ken Burns, and with the support of the late Senator John McCain, Mike Tyson, and Lewis among others, on May 24, 2018, 105 years after being convicted of violating the Mann Act, Johnson was posthumously pardoned by US President Donald Trump.

US President Trump holds a signing Executive Grant of Clemency for Johnson in the Oval Office with Deontay Wilder (second left) and Lennox Lewis (far right) in attendance.

And although Trump's pardoning of Johnson ""brought him back into public view,"" Runstedtler contends Johnson's legacy of rebellion against the status quo wasn't fully acknowledged during the pardon campaign.

""(The White campaigners) don't actually want to embrace a more subversive legacy that he has, which I think is actually the more complicated one and the one that I would hope that he would be remembered for.

""Certainly the campaign to pardon him has brought him back into public view for mainstream White America and potentially folks who are boxing fans in other countries around the world. But there's still a kind of underlying or subversive aspect to his legacy, and I don't think has been fully acknowledged in that pardon campaign.""",2020-07-03,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/03/sport/jack-johnson-fight-of-the-century-110-anniversary-boxing-cmd-spt-intl/index.html
Aimee Lewis,Has the digital age changed football fans?,"(CNN) Sky Ouyang used to avidly follow Real Madrid, keeping up to date with how the La Liga club was doing from his Shanghai home.

A Real shirt from the 2008/09 season -- Cristiano Ronaldo's first campaign as a Real player -- was a prized possession. But then Ronaldo moved to Juventus and Ouyang's loyalties changed.

Focused flicked from Spain to Italy; to the back of the wardrobe went the Real shirt, in came Juventus merchandise, and immediately it was the Italian club the 23-year-old followed on every social media platform.

""I support Ronaldo first and foremost. The team isn't important, it's whoever he plays for,"" the social media executive, who first fell under the Portuguese's spell when Ronaldo was the young buck at Manchester United beguiling with step-overs and swerves, tells CNN Sport.

Ouyang is not alone in switching his allegiances to Juventus following Ronaldo's $117m summer transfer from a club with whom he established himself as one of the greatest to have played the beautiful game.

With 139m Instagram followers, 74m on Twitter and over 122m on Facebook, Ronaldo is the most followed footballer on social media.

Juventus was the fastest growing European club online in China last month, the number of followers ballooning at a rate which has been described as unprecedented.

Perhaps it should be of no surprise that five-time Ballon d'Or winner Ronaldo, a footballer who has only one equal in Lionel Messi for comparable talent and fame, attracts such zealous following in a country where success and celebrity is cherished.

""There hasn't been an incident like this where there's been fans moving from one team to another or deciding to choose and follow a second team. This is probably the largest shift we've ever seen in China,"" says Tom Elsden, senior client manager at Shanghai-based digital marketing and investment company Mailman.

""In the same period, Real Madrid have lost followers so there's been a direct correlation between Juventus growing and Real Madrid losing followers.""

But the tidal wave of followers which came Juventus' way once it signed one of the world's most famous sportsmen was not merely a Chinese phenomenon.

The Bianconeri has gained 3.5m Instagram followers over the last month, while Juventus' engagements, impressions and followers on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have also rocketed.

Does Ronaldo's digital influence, his power to change a fan's allegiance, mean the nature of football fandom has changed?

If Ronaldo, Neymar and Messi all have a bigger social media following than their clubs, is this the era where the sport's biggest names garner more devotion than the teams for whom they play?

Simon Chadwick, professor of sports enterprise at Salford University, says the cult of celebrity has changed the way football fans around the world associate with teams and players.

""There is the emergence of celebrity culture over the last 15 to 20 years in a way that didn't exist in the 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s,"" he tells CNN Sport.

""We're now more interested in celebrities than perhaps we are teams and that's a characteristic of not just football and sport but of life in general.""

George Best is regarded as the first British sportsman to be accorded pop star status.

Star footballers have been hero-worshiped since the beginning of the 20th Century and for decades have attempted to capitalize on their popularity.

At the peak of his footballing powers in the 1960s, former Manchester United winger George Best -- a man once dubbed the fifth Beatle -- famously appeared in an advert in the United Kingdom telling viewers that Cookstown bangers were ""the Best family sausages.""

But much has changed since those black and white days when one of the world's most celebrated players helped increase sales in sausages for a family butcher.

Advertising campaigns are more sophisticated, footballers' brands are carefully cultivated, major clubs and their players are lucrative businesses and, crucially, there is the world wide web.

The internet, said Stephen Hawking, has connected us ""like neurons in a giant brain"" and has allowed players and clubs to communicate directly with fans, while in this globalized world almost everything is accessible, from live streaming a match to buying snazzy boots.

If, as renowned journalist Arthur Hopcraft once wrote, football reflects the kind of community that we are then the sport as it is today, and those who follow it, are a reflection of an interconnected world.

Fans wear Ronaldo and Messi masks during the Russia 2018 World Cup.

""There's something in the way in which the social and digital environment has enabled fans to challenge the existing ways of being a fan and perhaps therefore it's breaking down the barriers to fandom that previously existed,"" says Chadwick.

""The role of social media is shaping people's associations and perceptions.

""For many younger people in particular they have less affiliation with a football team that's embedded in the town where they're from and more association with global icons.

""Those global icons can be Manchester United or Real Madrid, but at the same time those global icons can be Kylian Mbappe, Ronaldo or Paul Pogba.""

Teenager Mbappe's goals and blistering forward play helped France win the World Cup in Russia. The 19-year-old, like so many of Generation Z (those born in the '90s and 2000s), hasn't lived in a world without social media.

France forward Mbappe was named the best young player at Russia 2018.

""We've not heard much about brand France or the marketing potential of the French national team. What we've heard lots about is the commercial potential of brand Mbappe,"" says Chadwick.

""There is a focus on the individual and the marketing of those individuals is consistent with Generation Z and the way Generation Z consumes products and associates with brands.

""I don't think we understand Generation Z as well as we should right now. Do we know that Generation Z is even interested in football? Aren't they more interested in social media and filming each other?

""I would stand by my observation that Generation Z is interested in individuals and their point of engagement is around individuals and you see that through the emergence of vloggers and internet celebrities.""

'Portfolio fandom'

Then there is ""portfolio fandom"" as Chadwick puts it, a reference to fans who will support a number of teams, typically one from each major European league, reflecting ""the fluid and open way many of us lead our lives.""

Portfolio fandom has, to a certain extent, existed for decades. Ardent fans of one particular club will often have a soft spot for a team in a different division.

The nature of fandom has changed, probably for the worst in terms of social media. Michael Calvin

The popularity of the football program ""Football Italia"" which broadcast Serie A matches live on terrestrial TV in the UK in the 1990s helped make following the Italian top flight hipster cool before the word hipster had entered the popular lexicon. That was also, of course, before the English Premier League spread its tentacles across the globe.

Yet even two to three decades ago, the sight of a Barcelona shirt, let alone one with the Catalan club's star player Messi embossed on the back, was rare anywhere outside of the region.

These days seeing children playing in, for example, a Barcelona shirt is common in many neighborhoods around the world. The name on the back of that shirt is also often entirely predictable.

A Cuban boy wears a Barcelona shirt in Havana.

Boys wearing Real Madrid's and Manchester United jerseys sit on a bench in Skopje, Macedonia.

""You hear small anecdotes about kids who might not be Real Madrid fans but they're Cristiano Ronaldo fans,"" says Michael Calvin, an award-winning English sports journalist and author.

""The nature of fandom has changed, probably for the worst in terms of social media.""

Calvin is referring to the rise of Arsenal TV, a channel which has over 820,000 YouTube subscribers and 285,000 Twitter followers, and personifies how the digital age has given fans a platform to voice their opinions, be it for good or bad.

""I don't feel it's very healthy,"" adds Calvin. ""They've got every right to their opinion but it's an uneducated opinion in many cases.

""The whole phenomenon of fan TV where you get people basically expanding on their prejudices and condemning managers out of hand. I don't think that's a very welcome development.""

Millwall fans outside The Den before a Championship match.

In his latest book ""The State of Play,"" Calvin touches on Millwall, a London-based team in the second tier of English football which, like many of its stature, is not internationally supported.

Those who follow the Championship club do so because such devotion has been bequeathed from one generation to the next.

You're born into being a Millwall fan. With the working clubs it's a birthright. Michael Avery

Michael Avery supports the Lions, as did his father, his grandfather, and as do his two children.

""You're born into being a Millwall fan -- you don't think 'I'll start supporting them',"" Avery tells CNN Sport.

""You won't necessarily get someone who's 30 years old who's just got into football supporting Millwall.""

While the club is one promotion away from the riches of the Premier League, Avery says the majority of fans would not want to reach the promised land if it meant sacrificing the club's identity.

""Millwall prides itself on being a working-class club, a family club. It's never been known for big money transfer, or big wages,"" he explains.

""I do feel 95% of the fan base have heritage in the area. With the working clubs it's a birthright. As lovely as it would be to see Millwall make the Premier League, we don't want to sell that identity as a working-class football club just to make it to the top division.""

This week it was revealed that more than half of clubs in the Premier League could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the 2016-17 season because of the league's bumper broadcast deal.

In 2018, Deloitte said the majority of Europe's 20 richest clubs earn no more than a fifth of their income from 'matchday revenues.'

Clubs are increasingly targeting a global audience by signing lucrative commercial deals and so it should be of no surprise that the way those teams are being consumed has changed.

St. Pauli fans hold aloft a flag with the club's recognizable symbol.

Ed Barrett is a Manchester United fan living in Germany. He also follows St. Pauli, a Hamburg-based football club in Germany's second tier which has not won any major titles but whose 29,500-capacity ground is almost always full.

The anti-establishment club has also developed a global following, with its the skull-and-crossbones symbol proving highly marketable.

""FC St Pauli has an image that allows them to exploit a market niche. As such, they went on a sponsor laden tour of the key US market during the summer. If that helps us pay the bills without increasing ticket prices or selling the stadium name, then that really doesn't bother me,"" Barrett tells CNN Sport.

""Likewise, online content or tours by United to gear towards casual fans in the Far East isn't a huge disadvantage to match-going fans. At worst, a minor irritation if you bother following the club on social media where some of the content seems far removed from the essence of the club.""

Fandom has as many layers as a trifle. It is also complex. Fans come in many guises and the extent of their devotion varies. Not that the supporters themselves seem too concerned about these developing intricacies.

""It's a different kind of fan,"" Millwall's Avery says of the disciples of the global icons.

""As much as Ronaldo and Messi are the iconic image, there's obviously an interest in the brand of football. It's just how times have changed.""

It is the clubs themselves, the global players who have chased new supporters, who are having to adapt the most.

""The formation of the Premier League helped to instigate a culture change not just in English football, but in world football more generally,"" says Chadwick.

""The old days, which we can refer to as pre-1992 before the Premier League, were very conventional. They were much simpler and what that therefore did was create not just one generation of fans but multiple generation of fans.

""But post-1992, a new generation of citizens and consumers began to emerge and obviously this is being driven by globalization and digitalization and so the world of football fandom is now much more complex that it was 20, 30, 40 years ago.

""When you begin to factor in Juventus trying to target fans in China through Ronaldo, you're not talking about old Juventus fans and young Juventus fans, but Chinese fans too.

""What football clubs are faced with is having to understand somewhat the Chinese, Europeans, Americans, Millennials, Generation X, Generation X. There are differences between urban and suburban viewers, men and women.

""For football clubs, which are relatively small organizations, understanding this complexity is a huge challenge for them.""",2018-08-17,https://edition.cnn.com/2018/08/17/football/cristiano-ronaldo-juventus-social-media-fans-china-spt-intl/index.html
Motez Bishara,Gay Bowl attracts NFL sponsors and touches lives,"Denver, Colorado (CNN) Magic, it seemed, was possible any time Dorien Bryant touched the ball.

Electric runs like the 98-yard opening kickoff return for a touchdown in front of 108,000 at Penn State, or the 95-yard score at home against Northwestern, or the touchdown catches of 53 and 41 yards against Indiana State peppered his college football career.

Bryant left Purdue University in 2007 as the school's career leader in all-purpose yards, setting multiple Big Ten conference records before signing with the Pittsburgh Steelers.

Yet just a year later, the playmaker was out of football, walking away from an offer from the Tennessee Titans and reportedly ignoring a call from the Dallas Cowboys.

""I came out when I was 24 or 25,"" Bryant tells CNN Sport of his decision to live openly as a gay athlete about a year after ending his NFL pursuit. ""It was more of my choice, I didn't try and push it.""

""I never wanted to be a figurehead for a movement; I don't want to be that guy.""

Dorien Bryant set records in four years at Purdue University, but walked away from an NFL contract to live an openly gay life.

For the first time since childhood, Bryant, who also ran track at Purdue, took a break from sports and focused on himself. Football became an afterthought.

""It was either football or being able to live my life the way I want to live my life, and I'm happier than I ever was,"" he says. ""I love football, but if I can't be me then it's not worth it.""

Now Bryant is back in the sport as his true self, featured as the go-to receiver for the 2017 champion New York Warriors at Gay Bowl, the annual tournament of the National Gay Flag Football League.

Fifty-seven teams from 22 cities battled it out in 100-degree Denver weather last month, in seven-on-seven matches that provided a remarkable level of athleticism for a recreational league.

Bryant is one of at least seven players on the Warriors with college football experience, recruited by teammate Wade Davis, a former Tennessee Titans signee who won an NFL Europe title with the Berlin Thunder.

""The competition has progressively gotten better,"" says Davis, 41, a figurehead in the league who takes the Warriors' quest to repeat as Gay Bowl titleholders seriously. ""The other teams have had to figure out how to get better players and better coaching.""

""I'm happier than I ever was,"" said Byrant (#9). ""I love football, but if I can't be me then it's not worth it.""

Over the past 18 years Gay Bowl has grown from a three-team tournament played in the dirt field of a Hollywood high school to a three-day event held in rotating cities boasting 35 sponsors, including United Airlines, Fidelity Investments, Sheraton Hotels and UPS.

Rosters represent a mix of races, genders and sexual orientations -- and welcome straight players, though their numbers are capped by a quota.

Everything is well organized, from the shuttle buses, to the singing of the Canadian and American anthems, to referees in striped uniforms who sound a lot like their NFL counterparts.

Games are governed by a 57-page rule book , and formed by two 30-minute halves, with tackling replaced by the removal of an opponent's flag belt.

""I never thought in my wildest dreams that it would get this big,"" says co-founder Jim Buzinski, ""but now it's so institutionalized. Cities are bidding for this.""

Honolulu, in fact, recently beat out bids from Austin and Toronto for the 2020 games, while New York will host its second Gay Bowl next year.

The New England Patriots were sponsors of last year's Gay Bowl in Boston, with owner Robert Kraft speaking at the closing ceremony. This year the Denver Broncos made a financial contribution and worked with organizers to boost the tournament's reach.

""This shows that an issue the NFL probably would have avoided at some point in the past, thinking it was controversial, is now so accepted in mainstream that it seemed a no-brainer to be a part of,"" says Buzinski, who also co-founded the news service Outsports. ""It is so routine that no one cares.""

""These are all football players and football fans, which is kind of a good business decision. It shows the progress that has been made.""

For most of the 1,000 or so participants of Gay Bowl, the long weekend represents a reunion of friends and a celebration of football -- the sport they love, which in many ways shaped their lives.

""The majority of my friends in DC are in the league,"" says James Santos of the Washington Generals, a former Air Force enlistee who would go on to win this tournament playing receiver in his fifth Gay Bowl.

""I have friends who met in the league who got married. I've been in weddings, birthday parties, and one funeral. They are like my family outside my immediate family.""

Flag football was also a means for Santos and his sister, who plays in the female league, to come out to their conservative church-going parents from Texas.

""How my parents grew up, it was really frowned upon,"" he says. ""You were just not considered normal, you were considered weak and a sissy.""

""That's just not the case at all, so for them to see that type of contact and passion ... it's just eye opening."" Santos' parents now attend their games often and ""are really into it.""

""These are like everyday people that love sports,"" he says, adding that flag football helped dispel damaging stereotypes sometimes associated with the LGBT community.

What would do wonders for the perception of gay male athletes, Santos says, is to be represented by a prominent pro.

""Like Jackie Robinson for black people, or Billy Jean King for women, we need an equivalent of someone like that to come out -- a stud athlete,"" says Santos, who is black. ""It would be okay. They are not going to lose their jobs.""

Gay Bowl participants take a knee during the singing of the American national anthem on the opening morning of the tournament, September 14, 2018.

Bryant agrees. ""Sheer numbers tell you there are a few LGBT players in the NFL and in the NBA as we speak,"" he says, ""it's just that those guys are afraid.""

The former Purdue standout wonders how things may have turned out if his shot at the NFL happened now instead of a decade ago. He points to Arizona State University signing openly gay high school football player My-King Johnson as a step forward.

""There is more of a conversation like that in professional sports now,"" he says. ""It's slow, but it's progress.""

It appears that football's locker room culture -- which nearly drove former Patriots offensive lineman Ryan O'Callaghan to suicide before coming out -- must evolve for a gay superstar to emerge.

Bryant's Warriors teammate, former San Diego State strong safety Shaun Rogers, says his personal life took a backseat until his athletic scholarship ended.

""Playing football is always like, how is my team going to respond? How is everyone going to respond?"" says the 35-year-old brand innovator with heavily inked arms.

""I don't want nobody to feel uncomfortable about the situation, so I kind of just suppressed it,"" he adds. ""After college, I just became more open with it.

""There was more freedom, I didn't have to worry about my teammates -- even though they were my friends. I just didn't have to be around that culture.""

Gay Bowl XVIII athletes congregated at a welcoming party at a rooftop bar in Denver, Colorado.

Alongside Bryant, Davis and Rogers are Stephan Benjamin, a 6-foot 4-inch, 211-pound former wide receiver at American International College, captain Preston Roberts Jr. from Worcester Polytechnic, and quarterback Chris Allison from Columbia University.

Gelling with the LGBTQ league's ethos of inclusion, Roberts and Allison are two of the Warriors' five allotted straight players, with no more than three allowed on the field at once.

Both prefer to play in New York's gay flag football league, rather than the ragtag games they were a part of in the city. ""I can't think of a straight league that is on this level doing this type of stuff,"" says Roberts.

""This is legit,"" says Allison. ""First off, everyone's got a jersey. Then you've got the tents (shielding resting players from the sun), you've got websites, you've got first aid here. Everyone's got a plan of action.""

""A lot of these leagues we've played in have been ad hoc, you've seen fistfights,"" he adds, noting that in the gay leagues ""people get a little chippy from time to time with competitiveness. But if there is a fight, you're gone. It's not acceptable.""

During his first practice, the quarterback felt ""a different vibe"" straight away. ""Everyone was super friendly with a lot of camaraderie, and so I said 'Why don't we give it a go?'""

Roberts says joining the New York Gay Football League -- which welcomes ""straight allies"" on its website -- was by way of an understanding with Davis.

""He's taught me a lot about this league and about LGBT, so he's only expanded (my mind),"" he says, ""but he wouldn't have invited me to the league if he didn't think that this is something that I could become a part of.""

""If you're a gay participant and you invite a straight player, you probably trust them to be open enough.""

Warriors captain Preston Roberts Jr. (right), who is straight, credited the league for educating him on the LGBT community. ""If you're a gay participant and you invite a straight player, you probably trust them to be open enough,"" he said.

It's the opening morning of Gay Bowl XVIII and players on the vast green field on the outskirts of Denver are slow to get into a rhythm. Maybe a few too many carried on at the welcoming rooftop party the night before.

Bryant, who doubles as a personal trainer for budding college prospects and a bartender in New York, is used to playing on little sleep. ""I get off work on Saturday at like 5 a.m. and we'll practice at like 9 a.m.,"" he says.

Boasting a considerable size advantage, the Warriors dispose of their opponents convincingly.

If anyone on the field is keeping track of which three straight players are playing for each team, it isn't apparent. Enforcement has always been based on an honor system, and by all accounts it works.

""I'm not going to say it's never come up,"" says Roberts of the Warriors' inclusion of high-caliber straight players, ""but relatively speaking, it doesn't. There is a rule for it, but it's not a thing.""

Playing in his fourth Gay Bowl, the former Ivy Leaguer Allison is one of several straight quarterbacks in the league, because -- just like in the NFL -- good flag football quarterbacks are hard to find.

""I'm sure there are a few people who are frustrated about it,"" he says. ""There is definitely a debate there. You have to balance it out and make sure we come to some middle ground where everyone can be happy.""

Buzinski explains why a quota system was implemented after he founded the Los Angeles league. ""We didn't want a situation where a 'gay team' would have 75 percent straight players, and they were the best straight players in high school or college, and they would be ringers.""

""People said, 'Well isn't that discriminatory?' No. You can play flag football in LA or any city in multiple leagues, so they weren't being deprived of an opportunity,"" he notes, adding that he never saw ""a serious violation.""

""People policed themselves."" Besides, ""there was no way we could really test for it,"" he says.

""There were some players that people would swear were straight, and then their boyfriend would show up.""

Joe Cooper of the Denver Summit, who was honored by the league as a Hall of Fame inductee this year, sums up the consensus.

""At the end of the day, you have a lot of gay men who say 'I don't care if he's straight or not, I'm still going to whoop his ass on the football field.'""

Not to be outdone, women have featured prominently at the Gay Bowl since their inclusion seven years ago.

""We're very, very competitive, specifically when it comes to sports,"" says the Denver Mile High Club's Aszur Rollins, who has played on six championship teams. ""We can be a bit brutal with each other.""

New to the city after finishing her tour with the Army, Rollins found flag football ""all encompassing,"" and even met her wife through the league.

""It's really been this amazing experience at an adult time in my life,"" she says. ""I never went to college, so I consider this to be like a college experience for me. I never had this comradery, this sports experience.""

The Denver Mile High Club's Aszur Rollins (right), who won her sixth Gay Bowl, says flag football is ""all-encompassing"" and met her wife through the league.

Before she transitioned to life as a woman, Kaylee Parker played wide receiver at South View High School in North Carolina, battling several top college prospects in the state.

The 38-year-old mechanical engineer moved to Phoenix in 2015 and began living full time as a woman, but missed the competition.

""Originally, I just wanted to play football,"" she says of finding her way onto the Phoenix Fahrenheit, ""and once I started playing, I ended up meeting a lot of cool people, and it's basically like my other family now.""

""It didn't matter to me if it was a straight league or a gay league, but it happened to be what I found.""

Coming from a Phoenix league that is open to all genders, Parker's gender identity has not been an issue. But the Fahrenheit's team captain and quarterback admits she has received some resistance as a trans athlete competing in the women's division of Gay Bowl.

""Everyone has their perspectives,"" she says, adding that flag football is more about finesse, catching skills, quickness and strategy, and less about brute strength. ""So I think that the physicality of it goes out the window.""

(Her sentiment is echoed by Bryant, whose Warriors took fifth place this year. ""It's about who's smart,"" he says. ""You can have the 12 best athletes in this tournament and line up and still lose."")

""I think about it a lot,"" Parker says. ""I wouldn't compete if it was a tackle league.""

The other competitors, she feels, are perfectly capable of facing her across the line of scrimmage. ""I would think that it would discredit a lot of women if I said I wouldn't play.""

Kaylee Parker played high school football in North Carolna before transitioning to life as a woman. The 38-year-old mechanical engineer says her flag football teammates in Phoenix are ""like my other family now.""

Perhaps the game is less physical than tackle football, but it certainly can be rough.

One Warriors player is examined for a possible torn tendon in his knee after the team's very first game, while an LA Express player grumbles to Bryant that he lost a toenail in a collision.

""He acts like I did it on purpose,"" Bryant shrugs to a teammate, after encouraging the player to go to the first aid tent. ""It will grow back.""

Bryant -- who at 33 still sports a six-pack and the unmistakable frame of a pro athlete -- admits he was at first taken aback by the level of play in the league, then checked himself. Was he stereotyping too?

""You know what, you are kind of (surprised) at first,"" he says. ""But then when you step back and think about it, why? Why are we surprised?

""Because they are gay men? Like, we can play,"" he says, eyebrows raised, head nodding. ""It is a recreational league, but we can play.""",2018-10-17,https://edition.cnn.com/2018/10/17/sport/gay-bowl-xviii-nfl-denver-broncos-intl-spt/index.html
James Griffiths,"600,000 vote in Hong Kong opposition primary despite fears of new security law","Hong Kong (CNN) Braving scorching conditions, a new wave of coronavirus infections and government warnings they could be breaking the law, hundreds of thousands of Hong Kongers took part in a primary election for the city's democratic opposition over the weekend.

The vote, held 10 days after China imposed a sweeping new security law on the city , was designed to narrow down the number of pro-democracy candidates in September elections to the city's legislature.

The opposition camp is hoping to seize a historic majority in the parliament, through careful coordination to avoid splitting the pro-democracy vote, and in making headway in the functional constituencies, seats chosen by business and professional groups which form half of the legislature.

This would be a hard task at the best of times, and the government has already hinted that it may bar potentially dozens of candidates from those elections under the new security law, which criminalizes secession, subversion, terrorism, and collusion with foreign forces.

Mood among the opposition was considerably boosted Monday, however, after organizers said some 600,000 votes were cast in the primary election. That's around 27% of the number of people who voted in the most recent legislative elections, and far above organizers' original target of 170,000.

""Hong Kong people have made history again,"" Benny Tai, one of the organizers, said after the polling ended on Sunday night. ""Hong Kong people have demonstrated to the world, and also to the authorities, that we have not given up to strive for democracy.""

Erick Tsang, Hong Kong's Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs, said on Friday that the primaries might violate Hong Kong's new national security law because of the candidates' political stance, according to Hong Kong public broadcaster RTHK

""Those who have organized, planned or participated in the primary election should avoid carelessly violating the law,"" he said.

Late Friday night, police raided the offices of the Public Opinion Research Institute, a polling company that was helping to organize the primary. Organizers denounced the move as an attempt to disrupt the vote or intimidate people, while police said it was related to a tip about potential hacked data.

The police raid may have assisted in helping to publicize the primary election, however, with the news of the event circulated throughout the city.

Speaking to the South China Morning Post , one woman, who moved from China to the city 20 years ago, said she took part in the vote because she feared ""Hong Kong will become just like the mainland one day.""

""I did wonder whether it would be the last time I took part in such a primary,"" Kitty Yau told the paper. ""But I am not afraid of any 'white terror' as I am just exercising my rights.""

Security law

There has been a marked chill on the city's politics since the passage of the security law, which was imposed directly by Beijing, bypassing Hong Kong's legislature.

In the hours after it became law, multiple political parties disbanded, including one founded by prominent activist Joshua Wong. Online, people scrubbed social media profiles and deleted accounts, and asked contacts to wipe WhatsApp messages from them. Shops and restaurants that had been vocal supporters of the anti-government protest movement could be seen hastily removing posters, for fear of being prosecuted under the new law.

While the government has repeatedly insisted the law will only affect a tiny minority of Hong Kongers and was necessary for protecting national security, it has been met with widespread opposition both in the city and overseas.

Last week, Australia joined Canada in suspending its extradition treaty with Hong Kong . Canberra said it will also offer a path to citizenship for Hong Kongers, following the UK's promise to enable some 3 million Hong Kongers to settle there should they wise.

Considerable uncertainty remains around the law, and many groups inside the city not directly targeted by it -- NGOs, media organizations, and businesses -- are waiting to see how it may affect them.

In a survey of 183 companies published Monday, the American Chamber of Commerce found that 76% of respondents were concerned about the law, with 40% saying they were ""extremely concerned.""

""The uncertainty of the regulations is slightly worrying and the current conflict between US and China,"" one respondent was quoted as saying. ""This could lead to a situation where China arrests people based upon political reasons.""

Some 68% of respondents said they had become more concerned about the law as details have emerged, with one respondent saying ""vague language makes the law a perfect tool for rule by law, and is already leading to the kind of self-censorship that is so effective at stifling public discourse in China.""

Respondents said their main concerns about the law were its ambiguity and potential effect on the independence of the judiciary, and a bare majority, 52%, said they may consider leaving Hong Kong as a result of the law.",2020-07-12,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/12/asia/hong-kong-democratic-primary-election-intl-hnk/index.html
James Griffiths,How a Long Island man ended up in a Chinese prison on espionage charges,"Hong Kong (CNN) Driving from their home in New York to Cambridge, Massachusetts, Harrison Li had no idea it would be the last time he saw his father for more than a decade.

It was the summer of 2016, and Li was about to resume his studies at Harvard. After dropping him off, his father returned to Long Island, where he was making final preparations for his own trip to Shanghai.

""We had no inkling anything like this was going to happen,"" the younger Li said.

Kai Li was born in Shanghai, and he was returning to the city for a ceremony to mark the one-year anniversary of his mother's death. However when his plane landed, he was met not by his family, but state security agents -- beginning a years-long ordeal that resulted, in July 2018, in him being sentenced to 10 years in prison for espionage.

The Li family maintains that the charges are trumped up and politically motivated. The case, which was held behind closed doors and has not been widely publicized, revolves around supposed state secrets that Li and his lawyer argue are freely available online, as well as communications with the United States government that are routine for people doing cross-border business.

In a letter to President Donald Trump in January, multiple US lawmakers denounced Li's ""arbitrary detention"" and urged Washington to do more to lobby for his release.

China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not respond to a faxed request for comment from CNN on the case.

Political prosecution

Kai Li appeared to be an American success story. Born in Shanghai in 1962, he emigrated to the US aged 27 to study, and later became an American citizen. A natural entrepreneur, he opened two gas stations on Long Island and also a export business, serving as a wholesale buyer and distributor of solar cells and related technologies for major US aerospace firms. China is among the largest manufacturers of solar equipment in the world.

For his export business, Li regularly traveled to the country to meet with clients, as well as to visit his extended family.

""My father would visit China a couple of times a year, for two or three weeks at a time,"" Harrison Li said. ""He's been doing that for 20-plus years.""

Prior to being detained by state security at the airport in Shanghai, Harrison Li said the family had no idea anything might be amiss. While the motivation behind the case is unclear, Kai Li has since suggested to his son that it could have been prompted by a business rival seeking to get him in trouble with the authorities.

China's justice system is particularly opaque -- especially when it comes to cases regarding state security. No details about Li's case have been published in China, either by the court or state media. Li's eventual trial was held behind closed doors, without US officials present.

For two months, Li was held in residential surveillance at a designated location , an extralegal system a panel of United Nations human rights experts has described as ""tantamount to enforced disappearance,"" which exposes detainees ""to the risk of torture and other inhuman and degrading treatment and other human rights violations.""

During that time, US consular officials alerted Li's family to his situation. According to US lawmakers and Li's family, he was denied access to a lawyer during his initial detention.

Following this, he was moved to another detention center while awaiting charges. There he was held in a small cell, without a bed, forced to sleep on the floor, fed little, and interrogated at all hours, Harrison Li said. Eventually, he was transferred to a regular prison and charged with furnishing Chinese state secrets to the FBI. His family maintains that normal business actions by Li have been ""grossly mischaracterized by Chinese authorities as espionage for political leverage.""

According to the US Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC) , the trial against Li, in July 2018, took place in secret, and was over within an hour. US diplomats were prevented from attending, the CECC and Harrison Li said.

Kai Li was eventually sentenced to 10 years in prison, and moved to Shanghai's Qingpu prison.

Dire conditions

A futuristic-looking complex located in the far west of the city, Qingpu prison is one of the main detention centers for foreigners in China. Its website describes it as ""window to showcase China's rule of law.""

Briton Peter Humphrey, who was held in Qingpu after his 2014 conviction on contested illegal information gathering charges , said that ""from the moon, Qingpu Prison would look like a peaceful walled university campus with dorms, gardens, camphor trees, a soccer pitch and a parade ground.""

""From my level, there were a dozen concrete cell blocks with barred windows, a prison theatre, an office block, a kitchen, a boiler house and a factory,"" Humphrey wrote in 2018 , following his release. ""The perimeter wall bristled with razor wire and was patrolled by armed PAP (people's armed police) guards. It could hold 5,000-6,000 prisoners. It also 'trained' prisoners for redistribution to other prisons.""

The prison made international headlines last year, when a British school girl found a message from inmates written inside a Christmas card

""We are foreign prisoners in Shanghai Qingpu prison China,"" the message read. ""Forced to work against our will. Please help us and notify human rights organization.""

The scandal forced supermarket chain Tesco to drop its Chinese supplier, though authorities in the country denied accusations of forced labor.

Prisoners seen inside Shanghai's notorious Qingpu prison, which has been accused of using forced labor in the past.

Humphrey said he regularly witnessed beatings and prisoners being forced to write confessions or being held in solitary confinement. He said he was denied medical treatment for prostate issues, and worried about his health.

Kai Li's health has also suffered, his son said: ""In his last two calls he complained for the first time about issues with his heart, of an irregular heartbeat and occasional numbness in his arm.""

Harrison Li said the prison doctor gave his father a blood pressure test and prescribed him a blood thinner, but would not respond to requests for a more thorough medical examination.

He added that Kai Li is careful in phone calls and letters, reminding his family that they are ""closely monitored.""

Kai Li in 2015 off the Long Island Sound, New York. Born in Shanghai, Li emigrated to the US in 1989 and became an American citizen.

Coronavirus complications

As well as heart issues, Harrison Li said the coronavirus had become a concern for his father in recent months. While it is largely under control in China, prisons have been sites of significant outbreaks in the country and around the world, due to crowded conditions and poor sanitation.

Though so far Kai Li has remained coronavirus free, the pandemic has affected him in other ways.

""The level of nutrition at the prison has gone down significantly,"" the younger Li said. ""There's no longer any fruits or vegetables in the diet or even available for purchase anymore. He asked to be able to get multivitamins, or even to buy them at the commissary, but that has been rejected.""

Harrison Li said the pandemic has also essentially cut Kai Li, and other foreign prisoners, off from the outside world, with no consular visits allowed since the virus began spreading in China in January.

In an email, a US State Department official confirmed this, saying the Chinese government ""suspended all in-person visits to detention centers and prisons on January 23, 2020 in order to reduce the spread of COVID-19.""

""The Department of State has no higher priority than the safety and welfare of US citizens overseas,"" the official added. ""During this suspension, our consular officers have been able to reach most U.S. citizen prisoners serving their sentences in China by phone in lieu of in-person consular visits. The US Mission China team continues to seek access to all persons in custody, and will resume regular in-person visits to detained U.S. citizens in accordance with guidance from health authorities once the Chinese government lifts its restrictions on consular visits.""

Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor have been detained in China on state security charges since 2018.

'Painful ordeal'

In a letter to Trump in February last year, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and other lawmakers urged the President to be a ""vociferous advocate"" for Kai Li's release.

""This painful ordeal has gone on for far too long and caused immeasurable harm to Mr. Li and immense pain for his family in New York,"" the lawmakers wrote.

At that time, negotiations were still progressing towards a US-China trade deal . However since then, relations between the two countries have taken a marked turn for the worse -- particularly since the beginning of the corovanirus pandemic, which the Trump administration has sought to blame on Beijing.

""US-China negotiations seem to be hitting new lows everyday,"" Harrison Li said. He added that it was encouraging to see US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's recent meeting with a top Chinese diplomat in Hawaii , but whether those talks will result in progress remains to be seen.

""As Secretary Pompeo has previously met with the loved ones of many Americans wrongfully detained abroad, I hope to get the opportunity to plead my father's case to him directly in the near future,"" Li added.

Kai Li is the only US citizen held on state security charges. His son compared his case to that of two Canadians, Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig, who were this week officially charged with espionage . The two Canadians were detained in 2018, following the arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver.

""My father is part of a broader pattern of the Chinese government charging foreign citizens on state security charges,"" Harrison Li said. ""It really highlights the danger for Americans looking to do business in China.""

People may see headlines about the two Canadians, he said, but ""this happens to Americans too.""

He fears that danger could soon extend beyond mainland China. The country's parliament, the National People's Congress (NPC), is due to impose a national security law on Hong Kong in the coming weeks , criminalizing separatism, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces.

Carrie Lam, the city's chief executive, has said the law would ensure ""the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong,"" with the proposed bill ""in line with the (city's) rule of law.""

But Harrison Li said it could result in ""political prosecutions.""

""(My father's) detention illustrates that China's national security laws are inherently arbitrary and can be used to exploit foreign citizens for political leverage,"" he said. ""That's something important for Americans to be aware of.""

Sherisse Pham,"Luckin Coffee ousts chairman, names new CEO","Hong Kong (CNN Business) Luckin Coffee has ousted its chairman and named a new chief executive, as the company tries to draw a line under an accounting scandal that has rocked its business.

The embattled Chinese coffee chain named Jinyi Guo chairman and CEO, after shareholders voted to remove co-founder and former chairman Charles Zhengyao Lu, Luckin said in a regulatory filing on Monday.

Starbucks SBUX Luckin went public last year and surged due to what appeared to be strong sales growth. But then the company — which was once hailed as China's homegrown rival to— admitted in April that a good portion of its 2019 revenues were fabricated . Its shares collapsed following the revelations.

Luckin stock is down nearly 93% for the year, and the Nasdaq has decided to delist the company

Guo has been the acting CEO since May, after Luckin fired chief executive Jenny Zhiya Qian and chief operating officer Jian Liu — the executive whom the company said was the architect of the fraud.

Jennifer Hansler,US declares 'most' of China's maritime claims in South China Sea illegal,"(CNN) US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Monday announced a formal rejection of ""most"" of China's maritime claims in the South China Sea, the latest in the escalation between Washington and Beijing.

Describing the move as ""strengthening U.S. policy,"" the top US diplomat asserted that ""Beijing's claims to offshore resources across most of the South China Sea are completely unlawful, as is its campaign of bullying to control them.""

""The world will not allow Beijing to treat the South China Sea as its maritime empire. America stands with our Southeast Asian allies and partners in protecting their sovereign rights to offshore resources, consistent with their rights and obligations under international law,"" Pompeo said in a lengthy statement.

Beijing claims almost all of the 1.3 million square mile South China Sea as its sovereign territory and over the past several years has built up military fortifications on several islands.

But specific islands and waters in the South China Sea are claimed by several states and islands that surround it, including the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei and self-governing Taiwan.

Beijing has impeded commercial activity like fishing or mineral exploration by some of those countries as it stakes ownership of territory it claims has belonged to China for hundreds of years.

Late Monday, the Chinese Embassy in Washington had harsh words for Pompeo's announcement, calling the accusations ""completely unjustified.""

The US ""distorts the facts and international law ... , exaggerates the situation in the region and attempts to sow discord between China and other littoral countries,"" the Chinese Embassy said in a statement.

China also accused Washington of ""stirring up tension and inciting confrontation"" in a region where it is not directly involved in the disputes.

Pompeo's move Monday is ""pretty significant,"" said Gregory Poling, a senior fellow for Southeast Asia and director of the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

""What the US basically said is that we are going to remain neutral on questions of who owns what island or rock in the South China Sea, but we're no longer going to keep quiet on China's illegal claims to the waters,"" Poling explained, adding that in the past, the US had been ""cagey"" on the matter.

Poling told CNN that ""a lot depends on how"" the US follows through on Monday's announcement, but called it ""a big blow diplomatically.""

""It lets the US very clearly call out China's activities as illegal, not just destabilizing or unhelpful, but to say this is illegal,"" he said. ""That helps partners like Vietnam and the Philippines, and it's going to put pressure on other countries -- the Europeans, for instance -- to get off the fence and say something themselves.""

Pompeo said Monday that the US was aligning its position with that of a 2016 decision issued by the Permanent Court of Arbitration, which sided with the Philippines against China's assertions that it had historic and economic claims to much of the South China Sea.

That unanimous decision ""rejected the (People's Republic of China's) maritime claims as having no basis in international law,"" the top US diplomat noted, adding, ""As the United States has previously stated, and as specifically provided in the Convention, the Arbitral Tribunal's decision is final and legally binding on both parties.""

In the statement, Pompeo also took aim at China's attempts to establish maritime claims inside other countries' Exclusive Economic Zones, areas extending 200 miles into the sea from the shore. The top US diplomat specifically said China ""cannot lawfully assert a maritime claim -- including any Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) claims derived from Scarborough Reef and the Spratly Islands -- vis-a-vis the Philippines in areas that the Tribunal found to be in the Philippines' EEZ or on its continental shelf.""

He also rejected China's claims to Mischief Reef and Second Thomas Shoal -- ""both of which fall fully under the Philippines' sovereign rights and jurisdiction"" -- and said China ""has no lawful territorial or maritime claim to (or derived from) James Shoal, an entirely submerged feature only 50 nautical miles from Malaysia and some 1,000 nautical miles from China's coast.""

In addition, the US ""rejects any PRC maritime claim in the waters surrounding Vanguard Bank (off Vietnam), Luconia Shoals (off Malaysia), waters in Brunei's EEZ, and Natuna Besar (off Indonesia).""

""Any PRC action to harass other states' fishing or hydrocarbon development in these waters -- or to carry out such activities unilaterally -- is unlawful,"" Pompeo said.

Zack Cooper, a research fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, told CNN ""that is really the core of this.""

""The US is professing support for these countries' rights in those areas. Now, if the US wants to come to support an ally or partner in the South China Sea which is getting pushed around by China, now it has the legal justification to say China's actions are illegal in our view... even though Pompeo has previously indicated these are coercive actions by the Chinese, he probably would not have said they are illegal, now he can,"" he explained.

Beijing has established military facilities in both the Paracel Islands, known as the Xisha Islands in China, and the Spratly Islands, known as the Nansha Islands in China.

The US military regularly challenges China's occupation of those features with so-called Freedom of Navigation operations, in which US warships or aircraft operate in international waters.

China always calls these operations violations of its sovereignty.

The US has been stepping up those challenges this year, increasing tensions between the two rivals.

Amid those heightened tensions -- and after China completed naval exercises in near the Paracels earlier this month -- the US sent two Navy aircraft carriers to the South China Sea.

Operating under the name the Nimitz Carrier Strike Force, the American carriers, the USS Nimitz and USS Ronald Reagan, ""conducted several tactical exercises designed to maximize air defense capabilities and extend the reach of long-range precision maritime strikes from carrier-based aircraft,"" a US Navy statement said last week.

It is the first time since 2014, and only the second since 2001, that two US carriers have operated together in the South China Sea, according to Lt. Cmdr. Sean Brophy, a spokesperson aboard the Reagan.

Rishi Iyengar,"My parents gave up their American Dream and moved back to India. 25 years later, I asked them why","(CNN) Whenever I write about President Donald Trump's efforts to crack down on work visas, more than a dozen times since I started working at CNN in 2016, I call my parents afterward and thank them for the kind of life they have given me — one full of the opportunities many immigrants now fear losing at the stroke of a pen.

My dad, Partha, moved to the United States in the early 1980s to study; my mom, Jhumkee, followed soon after. They ended up staying for more than a decade before uprooting the family and moving back to India when I was four. My sister and I grew up in their hometown of Pune with US passports and came back every summer, enjoying, as the cliché goes, ""the best of both worlds"" and an extraordinary level of privilege.

I made the customary thank-you call again last month after Trump's executive order suspending several work visas for the rest of this year, including the H-1B that allowed my parents to build a life in America nearly three decades ago.

The H-1B visa was created for ""specialty occupation"" workers as part of the Immigration Act of 1990 , a law that provided the framework for today's legal immigration system. It's one of the most popular work visas, with tens of thousands of workers using it to come into the US each year — more than half of them Indians. But the Trump administration has repeatedly targeted the program, accusing companies of using it to bring cheap foreign workers to replace Americans and enacting a series of restrictions that have created a climate of fear and uncertainty for many immigrants.

So when I called my parents this time, I decided to also interview them — about their pursuit of the American Dream, their decision to give it all up, whether they had any regrets, and how their experience can help to understand this moment of tremendous turmoil for immigrants.

America: A land of opportunity, and 'computers'

Unilever UL My father ended up in the US by process of elimination. He dreamed of being a pilot in the Indian Air Force but didn't make the cut. He then went to college, got a degree in engineering, and made it to the final interview round for Hindustan Lever (now Hindustan Unilever) — the Indian subsidiary of global consumer brand— along with four other candidates.

""If I had got the Hindustan Lever job I probably would not have come to the US,"" he said.

The company hired three of the final five candidates. He wasn't one of them. He also didn't get into any of the top Indian business schools. But at one of those school interviews in 1980, he ran into an acquaintance who was visiting from the US and told my dad he should think about getting into this ""up and coming"" field called computers.

""This friend asked: 'Oh are you interested in hardware or software?'"" my dad recalled. ""I had no clue what he was talking about, what hardware is and what software is, so I said 'Both! I want to do both!' I was that clueless.""

My father at his graduation at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1986.

That's how, in 1982, my dad entered the alphabet soup that is the US immigration system. He came to the US on an F-1 student visa, pursuing degrees at two schools that offered him financial aid, before returning to India to get married. My mom joined him in the US in 1985 on an F-2 dependent visa.

""I was very excited,"" she said. ""It was my first time going out of the country.""

But there were also profound moments of homesickness in those early years. ""Your dad had to completely stop listening to Hindi songs, poor thing, because the minute he put them on I would start crying,"" she said.

My dad finished grad school with a job as an analyst at a defense subcontractor that made aircraft engine parts. At that point, he had one year to work in the country under the Optional Practical Training (OPT) rule.

""I knew that I had to impress them enough in that one year that they would be willing to do my H-1 process,"" he said. ""Back then this whole immigrant visa and all that wasn't as big a known thing as it is now.""

A moment of uncertainty

About six months in, he gently broke the news to his employer that there was an additional process they'd have to go through to keep him for longer. Fortunately, the company agreed, hired an immigration lawyer, and in six months he had the H-1 visa, as it was called back then. By the end of 1989, he'd applied for and received a green card.

In 1986, the year my dad got his H-1, the US admitted 26,227 Indian immigrants overall, according to government data. Last year, Indians received 278,491 H-1B visas (including renewals) — more than 71% of the total. That's been the case for years, skewed by the tech industry which has long relied on the visa program to bring Indian engineers to the US. But country-specific limits on green cards imposed in 1965 mean that tens of thousands of Indians applying for a green card this year won't receive them until at least 2055 because of a huge backlog in petitions from India, according to a recent analysis of US immigration data by the libertarian think tank Cato Institute.

In the roughly three years that my dad was going through the now common work-visa-to-green-card process, my mom had switched from the F-2 visa to her own F-1 to do her Masters from Tufts University in Boston. She then joined tech company Pitney Bowes on her OPT, but only had to wait a few months since her green card was tied to my dad's.

My parents at their first home in the US in 1986, wearing hats my mom knitted.

Now nearly all those avenues are under attack. Less than two weeks after suspending H-1B visas for the rest of this year, the Trump administration announced all students at US universities on F-1 visas have to leave the country, transfer to another university or risk being deported if their fall semester is being held online amid the pandemic.

""This very rocky situation that exists wasn't there back then. There were uncertainties of the execution of the process, which is normal,"" my mom said. ""But [the notion] that the whole process can get an upheaval... that didn't exist.""

The most precarious moment they faced was just before the green card arrived, when my dad's company got acquired and planned to shut down the Connecticut plant where he worked. Had he still been on the H-1 and lost his job, he wouldn't have been able to file for unemployment and would have had to leave the country.

""It was a little bit touch-and-go,"" he told me. ""Luckily it came in time.""

Caught between two worlds

Soon after I was born, my dad decided to pursue another part of the American dream: entrepreneurship.

He left Gartner, the tech advisory firm where he would spend most of his career, to start his own firm, providing strategic consulting to US companies and also bringing consultants over from India to work on projects at those companies.

At that point, my dad had been in the US for almost 11 years and my mom had been here for eight, having also advanced in her career as a designer. They started to have what my dad referred to as ""the itch.""

""At all the Indian parties that was the favorite topic of conversation: 'Are you going to stay here or are you going to go back?'"" he said.

Many Indian workers increasingly choose to go back in a phenomenon known as ""reverse brain drain."" Exact numbers are hard to come by, but the growing frustration and uncertainty over immigration policy may now be spurring more Indians to consider returning home. A recent webinar for Indians contemplating a return from the US called ""Come Home and Build,"" organized by venture capital firm Lightspeed India, got so many sign-ups the organizers had to expand their Zoom subscription

In the early 90s, my parents witnessed a few friends who went to India, spent several months there and moved back to the US because it was too difficult to readjust to life back home.

A trip back to India for my first birthday made the decision clear. ""We came back here and realized what kind of a life it will be with [our] parents aging and bringing up a child in this culture,"" my mom said.

Family portait in 1995, shortly before we moved back to India.

Still, my parents continued to vacillate on the decision for a couple years — during which time my sister was born.

By that point, India had liberalized its economy, opening itself up to the rest of the world. My dad sensed the opportunity and successfully pitched Gartner — by then one of the clients of his new firm — on taking its tech advisory services to India.

In 1995, a few years before Y2K would put India's tech industry on the global map, my parents returned to Pune — a move timed so it would be before I started school. For my mother, that meant forfeiting a career and, potentially, a sense of individuality that America had allowed her to build.

""I got lots of recognition and appreciation for my work ... completely unrelated to who I was, where I came from,"" she said. ""That was a wonderful thing that I knew I wouldn't get in India ... going back was a very, very daunting process.""

But they decided that once they took the plunge, there would be no turning back. ""Most of those people ended up coming back to the US, [a] kind of path of least resistance,"" my dad said. ""We decided we're not going to try, come hell or high water, we'll make it work.""

How it's impacted me

Two decades later, my parents still live in Pune, but my sister and I live in the US.

Whenever someone asks, ""Where are you from?"" we don't have to think twice. We instinctively say, ""India,"" and immediately have a momentary identity crisis.

Everyone takes it at face value, though. And why wouldn't they? We've got the skin, we've got the accent. With that answer, no one's ever asked that dreaded follow-up question: ""But where are you really from ?""

We've spent most of our lives in India and it's where our roots are, but being American is also a fundamental part of our identity. I've never thought about giving up my US passport, but I imagine doing so would feel a bit like being locked out of half the rooms in my home.

It's also meant a lot of privilege guilt, especially growing up with friends now in the US going through the same process my parents once did — some of whom have already gone back, others who are planning to.

""I'm also mentally done with this whole uncertainty and insecure life where I don't know about what'll happen,"" one of those friends told me last week.

As so many wrestle with the decision of whether to stay in a country that now seems to be making it as difficult as possible for them to do so, I asked my parents what America represents to them. Their answers, recorded separately, were strikingly similar — and strikingly different to what the country feels like for many right now.

""The openness and acceptance, just merit is what gets you ahead,"" my dad said. ""It was really about what you could achieve and what you proved you could do.""

While watching the US from afar the last few years has ""diluted"" that image for him somewhat, ""I think the underlying spirit of the country still exists.""

My mom also used the word ""acceptance,"" soon after listing the other countries and cultures she was exposed to here -- friends from Egypt, Liechtenstein, Morocco, Tunisia, all brought together by the American Dream.

""The realization that people are the same everywhere, that used to hit me very starkly every time,"" she said. ""It didn't matter who you were, where you came from. What you did, your performance ... that is what mattered. It represented something wonderful, and that is the America we lived in.""",2020-07-12,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/12/opinions/us-immigration-visa-iyengar-essay/index.html
Tamara Hardingham-Gill,UK eases quarantine rules for travelers,"(CNN) — The UK government has relaxed quarantine rules for travelers from a number of destinations, including France, Italy, Belgium, Germany and Spain.

From July 10, visitors arriving in England from 58 selected countries will no longer be required to self-isolate for 14 days.

The US, China and Portugal are among the destinations that have been left off the list, which is to be kept ""under constant review.""

While it's been confirmed this will also apply to those visiting Wales and Northern Ireland, Scotland has issued a separate, smaller list made up of 39 countries, with Spain notably absent.

""Whether you are a holidaymaker ready to travel abroad or a business eager to open your doors again, this is good news for British people and great news for British businesses,"" Grant Shapps, UK secretary of state for transport, said in a statement last week.

""The entire nation has worked tirelessly to get to this stage, therefore safety must remain our watch word and we will not hesitate to move quickly to protect ourselves if infection rates rise in countries we are reconnecting with.""

The UK's mandatory two-week quarantine, which came into effect on June 8, has been criticized by many in the travel sector who feel it's slowed down the industry's recovery process in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Paul Charles, a member of Quash Quarantine, a campaign group lobbying the government to drop the measure, previously described the guidelines as ""unworkable and unenforceable.""

""A lot of jobs have gone in the last few weeks as people haven't been able to book holidays because they've been fearful of quarantine,"" he told CNN Travel.

""So, quarantine itself has acted as a block to future bookings.""

While travelers from the named countries won't have to self-isolate, they'll still need to provide the address of where they'll be staying for the duration of their trip.

According to the UK Department for Transport, the approved destinations pose ""a reduced risk to the public health of UK citizens.""

Tamara Hardingham-Gill,Boom supersonic jet set for 2021 take off,"(CNN) — Over 50 years after Concorde first took to the skies, a brand new supersonic jet is preparing for lift off.

Denver based start-up Boom Supersonic has announced it will roll out XB-1, a 1:3 scale prototype of its upcoming supersonic commercial jet Overture, on October 7, with test flights beginning in 2021.

The move will help to pave the way for the first commercial supersonic flights since the legendary delta-wing passenger airliner made its last flight in 2003

""XB-1 is the first step in bringing supersonic travel back to the world,"" Blake Scholl, founder and CEO of Boom Supersonic, said in a statement on the company's website.

""Flights at twice the speed mean we can travel twice as far -- bringing more people, places, and cultures into our lives.""

According to Boom, the purpose of XB-1 is to demonstrate and prove the ""key technologies"" for Overture, such as advanced carbon fiber composite construction and computer-optimized high-efficiency aerodynamics.

The company has also released images of the experimental aircraft, described as ""history's fastest privately developed aircraft,"" in the hangar, including the completion of its wing installation.

""Our experiences in the Covid-19 pandemic underscore for all of us the fundamental human need for personal connection,"" says Scholl.

""Faster travel enables us to experience the world's people, cultures, and places. With XB-1, we're demonstrating that we are prepared to bring back supersonic.""

The results of the XB-1 test program, which claims to be 100% carbon neutral, will allow the company to fine tune the design for supersonic airliner Overture.

""We're ensuring that the supersonic future is safe and environmentally and economically sustainable,"" he added.

""We've learned that the demand for supersonic has grown even faster than we anticipated.""

Before the pandemic, Boom had garnered at least $6 billion worth of pre-orders for the aircraft, which has a price tag of $200 million, with buyers included Virgin Group and Japan Airlines, which invested $10 million in the company in 2017.

If all goes to plan, Overture, which is designed to seat between 55 to 75 people, will begin passenger flights in 2030. It will focus on over 500 primarily transoceanic routes that will benefit from the aircraft's Mach-2.2 speeds -- such as New York to London, a journey that would take just three hours and 15 minutes.

The aircraft has been designed with the latest noise-reducing technologies and will only fly at supersonic speeds while over oceans to ensure that populated areas are not affected by sonic booms.

Maureen O'Hare,The world's best vineyards for 2020 revealed,"(CNN) — The comforting glug of wine into glass has been one of the few pleasures left to us during the long months of lockdown -- but how much better to enjoy it on a sunlit winery terrace.

The World's Best Vineyards awards, created to honor the finest in modern wine tourism, was meant to be held this year in the lush surrounds of California's Sonoma County wine region, but -- 2020 being 2020 -- the winners this year were revealed online.

There was one constant in these topsy-turvy times however; South America remains the best destination for a vineyard vacation (once we're all traveling again).

Winner at the inaugural 2019 awards and now again in 2020, Zuccardi Valle de Uco is an Argentinian winery in the heart of the Uco Valley, at the foot of the Andes mountains. A family-run business founded in 1963, it delivers what the Best Vineyard Awards calls ""precision-made high-altitude wines"" out of a stunning modernist bodega.

Uruguay's Bodega Garzón, once again in second place, was praised as a leader in sustainability. It offers a top-class program of tastings and events, and its 120-seat restaurant offers Uruguayan cuisine and panoramic views of the surrounding countryside.

No checklist, no criteria

The awards are based on nominations from a Voting Academy made up of more than 500 wine experts across the globe. To ensure the Academy is representative, the world is divided into 18 geographical regions, with 36 experts in each.

""There is no predetermined checklist or criteria,"" said awards founder Andrew Reed as he introduced the live-streamed event. ""The experience will take in all sorts of things connected with the visit. The tour, the tasting, the ambiance, the architecture, the wine, the food, the staff, the view... The list goes on.""

There were five South America winners in the top 20, with Chile's Montes and Viña Vik at 4 and 10 respectively, and Argentina's Catena Zapata, with its pyramid-like design inspired by Mayan architecture, dropping this year to No. 11.

Europe's best vineyard -- shooting up 16 positions to third place -- is not to be found in the traditional wine regions of France or Italy, but in an Austrian valley formed by the Danube River. Domäne Wachau, with its baroque castle and UNESCO World Heritage site surroundings, also wows with its Grüner Veltliner white wines.

Better year for Europe

The highest-placed French vineyard was Château Smith Haut Lafitte, near Bordeaux, at No. 7, which climbed seven places this year. Château Pichon Baron, also in Bordeaux, broke into the top 20 at No. 19.

Italy's best vineyard was Antinori nel Chianti Classico in Tuscany, up nine places to No. 9. Its new cellar, opened in 2012, is a glorious brick-red structure of terracotta and wood and is, explained the World's Best Vineyards voiceover, ""designed for gravity-flow winemaking."" With no use of pumps or mechanics, it's a gentler approach to an ancient craft.

Spain's Marques de Riscal winery (up three places to No. 6), with its eye-popping design by legendary architect Frank Gehry, is typical of the new breed of vineyard where top-class architecture is on the menu alongside the traditional varietals and gourmet food offerings.

Impressive new vineyard from Japan

New Zealand's Rippon, a biodynamic vineyard on the shores of Lake Wanaka, dropped five places to No. 13, but was still named Best Vineyard in Australasia.

North America's highest entry was Robert Mondavi Winery in Napa Valley, which climbed seven places to No. 5. It produces world-class Cabernet Sauvignon Reserve and Oakville District Cabernet Sauvignon.

The highest climber, however, was Delaire Graff Estate, in South Africa's Cape Winelands. Leaping 25 places up the list, and boasting ""unparalleled views of the Banhoek Valley, Stellenbosch vineyards and Table Mountain,"" it landed in 14th place and was named Best in Africa.

Japan's Château Mercian Mariko Winery, which only opened in September 2019, made a very impressive debut at No. 30, and was named Best in Asia.

Lebanon's emerging wine scene was represented by Château Oumsiyat (No. 38) and Chateau Heritage (No.48) and there were new entries from India (KRSMA Estates, No. 46) and Bulgaria (Wine Cellar Villa Melnik, No. 39).

The return of wine tourism

""There is no single definition for an amazing vineyard experience in the same way as there is no single definition for an amazing wine,"" said Reed as he introduced the live-streamed event.

""As the world begins to emerge from lockdown, people will start close to home to begin with, and eventually they will become more bold, and they will venture further away from home to find the food and drink which they want.

""There will of course be differences around the world, but I am sure we will get through this very soon.""",2020-07-14,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/world-best-vineyards-2020/index.html
Natasha Bazika,Black owner of French-style rosé label is on a mission to change the pink drink's perception,"(CNN) — Rosé, the pale pink adult beverage that gets its hue from the skins of red wine grapes, symbolizes summer for many.

Often, it's the drink linked to sun-kissed women sporting crisp, white flowy dresses and to female-only happy hours.

In spite of its richness — notes of cherry, grapefruit, strawberry and melon to name a just a few — and a color palette that ranges from muted blush to bold fuchsia, it rarely gets the respect it deserves.

But winemakers such as Donae Burston, founder of La Fete du Rosé , are pushing back against tired rosé stereotypes and attempting to make the beverage broadly appealing.

Burston, who's responsible for bringing the first Black-owned rosé label from France's Saint-Tropez to the United States, is up for the challenge.

#Roséallday

According to Amy Racine, beverage director of JF Restaurants, most mass-produced rosé is owned by larger companies who possess major Champagne and tequila labels, which tend to be marketed to a young, sometimes wealthy beach-town crowd.

In recent years, marketing efforts of certain rosé brands can also be attributed to the oversaturation of rosé on social media.

""The #roséallday has been used a lot and it can be a turnoff to a lot of people,"" said Racine. ""It's gained a reputation to be a party drink or just an afternoon sipper rather than a serious style.""

Enter La Fete du Rosé. Baltimore-native Burston, passionate about French rosé and his product in particular, is on a mission to disrupt the way many of us have come to think about rosé.

Owner and founder of La Fete du Rosé, Burston is an African-American pink wine-loving entrepreneur. The name of his brand translates to rosé party, so it's not that Burston has a problem with the drink's party-happy reputation. It's just that he wants to expand the party's reach.

Love at first sip

After working in the beverage industry for the likes of Dom Perignon, Veuve Clicquot, Ruinart and Moët & Chandon, Burston recognized some wines seemed marketed to specific demographics.

""I worked on Veuve Clicquot in 2009 and the consumer target was clear — a female who makes a certain income a year,"" says Burston. ""However, my friends who are Black, Asian and Hispanic liked to drink Clicquot, yet the popular brand segmented who they were for.""

Burston wasn't satisfied with brand association and set out to change the game.

Fifteen years ago, while celebrating his 30th birthday in Saint-Tropez in the French Riviera, Burston was introduced to rosé for the first time.

""I was sitting on Nikki Beach surrounded by people drinking what I thought was white Zinfandel, but it turned out to be rosé. From the first drop, I was hooked,"" says Burston.

As far as introductions go, Saint-Tropez was a perfect place to be seduced by the wine.

Donae Burston “It's a rosé party, and everyone is invited.”

The region's local vineyards are known to produce some of the world's top rosés, so it's little surprise that it's the tipple of choice for locals and visitors.

""Drinking rosé in Saint-Tropez was like drinking water in America. I was asked if I wanted a glass of rosé before I was asked if I wanted a glass of water,"" he says.

Rosé for one and all

Burston noted the inclusive nature of rosé in France — ""everyone drinks rosé"" — something he found sorely lacking once back in the United States, where many people still associate it with white Zinfandel.

In France, rosé isn't preferred by any one gender, age, religion or race, Burston explains.

""It's about good times, memories, and good wine any time of the year ... it's a rosé party and everyone is invited.""

Intoxicated by the universal nature of the pink drink, Burston set out to bring the same mentality back to the states.

After meeting the owner of St. Tropez's oldest vineyard, Burston enlisted his help to create La Fete du Rosé.

Boutique wine

Burston says he wanted to create a wine that was respected and to his liking, unlike the sweet mass-produced rosés he felt were dominating the US market.

He had another misconception to push through: The stereotype that Black people only like sweet drinks.

Because of this, Burston says many people, before tasting it, assume his rosé will be sweet.

But au contraire. And that goes both for the tired stereotype and the rosé.

Burston's traditional French-style rosé is dry with notes of melon, dried fruits, bonbon and hazelnut. It's acidic but round on the palate, and it has a noticeably long finish.

""As an African-American man who owns a rosé brand, I emphasized (through marketing) that it's a traditional dry rosé to push through the stereotype [that I'd created a sweet drink],"" says Burston.

The Cuvee he created uses 80% Grenache, 14% Mourvèdre and 6% Syrah grapes — resulting in a crisp medium-bodied wine with a lower alcohol percentage than many other rosés.

Burston's brand is on the affordable side, but at $25 a bottle, it does suggest a certain quality standard.

Brand building

Burston's marketing approach demonstrates his mission to change the tune on rosé, to ultimately get more people drinking it.

Donae Burston “Drinking rosé in Saint-Tropez was like drinking water in America. I was asked if I wanted a glass of rosé before I was asked if I wanted a glass of water.”

""Consumers are willing to try anything, but I know I needed to convince them to try my product — so I went to places they wanted to be,"" says Burston.

With a background on the business and marketing side of the industry, Burston brought the rosé to popular South Beach hotels and restaurants. Cliff Hawkins/Getty Images

He marketed La Fête du Rosé as a lifestyle brand, taking it to Nobu, W South Beach and other popular Miami restaurants and hotels to validate the brand to consumers. Burston organized themed parties and Caribbean festivals to reach different demographics, which he then used for social media to push his goal of inclusion.

Eventually the rosé secured high-profile fans including Michael Strahan.

In addition to creating a catchall brand, Burston wants to encourage consumers to drink rosé all year long.

""I took cues from the French,"" says Burston. ""They drink it (rosé) year-round so my strategy was to show rosé consumed in different seasons, whether it was through an après-ski shoot or explaining how to pair rosé with turkey for Thanksgiving.""

But Burston isn't just trying to get more people into rosé or turn a profit while doing so.

He also wants to give back to the community that supported him.

Giving back

""Traveling the world after college sparked my entrepreneurial spirit, and I want to help give others the same chance through my giveback program,"" he says.

Proceeds from every bottle sold send minority, low-income youths overseas to help them develop language and leadership skills in a globalized world.

""If we as Black business owners don't support the future, who will?"" says Burston.

In light of recent times, Burston has shifted his philanthropic focus to Color of Change, an organization fighting every day for racial justice and other organizations that serve as a resource for minorities pursuing a career in the wine and spirits industry. From now until August, $2 from every bottle (sold via website) will be donated to the organization.

La Fête du Rosé is available online and in stores across certain states including California, Georgia, Florida, New York and recently, Washington, D.C.

Tamara Hardingham-Gill,What happened when luxury hotels swapped tourists for medical workers,"(CNN) — To say the Covid-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the hotel industry is something of an understatement.

Countless big names were forced to close due to safety concerns and plummeting occupancy rates, with many yet to resume business again.

However, some chose to open their doors to doctors, nurses and other key workers fighting against the virus that's taken the lives of at least 500,000 people around the world so far.

In the US, a selection of hotel chains and independent properties offered up at least 3.4 million hotel rooms to healthcare workers on the frontlines.

In New York, America's hardest hit state, the Four Seasons New York was the the first to put up some of the city's medical personnel, welcoming staff from the New York State Nurses Association on April 2.

At least 225 rooms in the 52-story Midtown Manhattan building were made available for a seven-night minimum stay, with the team implementing various protocols, including a single point of entry where each person's temperature is checked.

Many other top hotels followed suit, including the New Yorker , A Wyndham Hotel, which housed a number of medical workers deployed to the city to fight against the virus.

Shadoe Daniels, a physician assistant from Pennsylvania who stayed here for four weeks throughout April, says bedding down at the historic hotel helped to take the pressure off him and his colleagues.

""Honestly every day was exhausting,"" he tells CNN Travel. ""But the New Yorker was very comfortable and convenient.""

""We all had traveled from a long distance away, so we needed a nice place to stay.""

Special guests

But this was far from a typical stay at the historic Art Deco-style hotel situated in Midtown West.

While there was little change to its exterior, the New Yorker looked very different inside.

For instance, its famous ballroom was transformed into a disinfecting zone in which workers would sanitize their hands as well as their shoes, before taking the elevator up to their room one person at a time.

In order to minimize the risk of infection, the New Yorker and other hotels were not able to offer room service or even a restaurant service. Instead, workers were usually provided with meal boxes, which they brought up to their rooms.

Daily housekeeping services were also shelved, however, guests were supplied with an appropriate amount of linen and towels at the start of their stay.

This was a huge relief to traveling physician Angela Mattke, who found herself taking an extended stay at the slightly more low key Residence Inn by Marriott Cleveland Mentor after flying into Cleveland for what was expected to be a short trip.

Although Mattke has stayed at the same hotel several times in the past, she admits to being afraid to let anyone into her room at all when she returned from working nights at the local hospital emergency room.

""I let them in once a week to change the sheets,"" Mattke, a spokesperson for the American College of Emergency Physicians, tells CNN Travel. ""And I would have fresh towels.

""But otherwise I really tried to keep them out, just in case I brought something home from the hospital. Even though I tried very hard not to.""

After a week, she realized she wouldn't be able to return home for a while due to the potential risk of picking up the virus and spreading it to her family and/or air passengers while flying home to Atlanta, and ended up staying for around nine weeks.

Like Daniels, Mattke says the security of the room helped her to feel slightly more at ease while being away from all her family and friends during the height of the virus.

""I was probably the only person in America who was not crazed looking for toilet paper,"" she adds.

""They took good care of me.""

Historic moment

Over in London, Claridge's , a five-star hotel known for hosting visiting royalty, opened to around 40 key medical workers just days after shutting its doors for the first time in its 200-year history.

""Even in the war we didn't close the doors, so it was quite a historic moment in our history,"" says Paula Fitzherbert, director of communications for the Maybourne Hotel Group, which owns London hotels The Connaught and The Berkeley, as well as Claridge's.

""As a London institution, you can't just take the city for the good bits, you have to be there for the bad bits too, and help to support.""

But while the team here felt honored to be hosting healthcare workers who were essentially putting themselves at risks to help save lives, they were disappointed not to be able to provide the usual standard of service a guest at the hotel would receive.

""We had to accept early on that we'd only be able to offer a comforting refuge,"" Fitzherbert tells CNN Travel.

""It wasn't going to be a five-star luxury hotel service, because the hotel wasn't in operation.

""It was very alien for our staff not to be able to extend the normal level of hospitality, but we tried our best to make it as comfortable as possible.""

Claridge's, which is located in Mayfair, also provided meals in boxes and scaled down cleaning services to limit contact between staff and guests.

As guests were staying for longer periods of times than usual, this wasn't much of an issue, and rooms were thoroughly cleaned after each check out and kept empty for three days between guests.

""We asked for longer stay doctors or nurses, so we weren't having to clean the rooms every day,"" explains Fitzherbert.

""The staff would knock on their doors and leave their meals outside.""

Such services proved to be a much-needed lifeline for workers brought to the UK capital during this period, as well as local workers impacted by limited public transport or concerned about infecting loved ones while working with Covid-19 patients.

No-one has a better understanding of this than Teena Ferguson, a senior manager for the Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust in London, who found herself in the unusual position of having to find hotel rooms for hundreds of staff.

""In the last nine weeks, my team has basically become a call center for accommodation,"" explains Ferguson, who has booked around 1,800 rooms for doctors and nurses working in high risk areas since March.

A local partnership was soon formed between the Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust and a number of hotels including the Hilton, Claridge's and the Hyde Park International, in order to ensure rooms were available to staff based at West London hospitals.

'Comforting refuge'

""The hotels have been a home away from home for all the doctors and nurses staying there,"" Ferguson adds.

""Especially at the beginning when no-one knew what the pandemic meant or what it would bring.""

Remco Norden, general manager at the Hilton London Metropole in Edgware Road, says his team were initially intimidated by the prospect of having to look after medical workers while the city was almost at a complete standstill.

""We were anxious and not sure what to expect after the full lockdown [in London],"" Norden explains to CNN Travel.

In order to make sure his workers felt safe, Norden created working ""bubbles"" in which the same staff would work four days on and four days off.

Meanwhile all of the communal areas, such as the lobby bar and restaurant, were closed, bringing about what he describes as an ""apartment complex"" vibe.

""The atmosphere has been completely different,"" adds Norden, who says the hotel has gone from having a thousand people in the building each day to just a few hundred.

But while many of the other hotels closed their doors before reopening solely to health care staff, the Hilton London Metropole has been looking after both standard guests and medical workers simultaneously, as some visitors were unable to checkout due to the pandemic.

""The other guests were all people who were stranded, so everyone at the hotel stayed for at least a month, which was very unusual,"" Norden adds.

""It turned from a corporate machine to a family-style atmosphere between the team and our guests.""

Mutually beneficial

Four Seasons New York was the first hotel in the city to offer rooms to medical workers. Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts

While the health care workers are beyond grateful for the rooms, Ferguson believes the hotels have provided them with much more than just a fancy roof over their heads.

""It's not just about getting us a room at a very reduced rate, if not free,"" she says.

""The hotels have been very thoughtful. Some have made notes of birthdays and put little goodie bags with a mini bottle of champagne outside their doors.

""They've really gone above and beyond.""

According to Ferguson, over 100 of her workers were evicted by their landlords during the pandemic, so the accommodation has been particularly invaluable to them.

""We had about 117 NHS workers who were homeless,"" she adds. ""That was really quite devastating for them.

""To have to come into work and be under that kind of pressure and then not have anywhere to stay.... So, it made a difference to their mental health.""

Thankfully the Covid-19 situation in cities like London and New York appears to be under control for the time being.

Transmission cases have largely dropped and many workers are now able to return to their homes, so the need for hotel rooms has lessened, particularly now that public transport is running regularly again.

""The fear and the risk has greatly reduced,"" says Ferguson. ""So the service isn't required for as many people as it was.

""By the end of June, no-one should be in a hotel.""

While the experience has certainly been of benefit to the medical workers concerned, it's also proven to be a huge advantage to the hotels.

Many of the measures that were initially brought in temporarily, such as ditching buffet services and offering contactless check-in and checkout, have become standard practice in hotels around the world.

""Things have now been given a formal name,"" adds Norden.

Atika Shubert,The extreme hotel hygiene awaiting tourists in Spain,"(CNN) — It's breakfast time, which means I need to get my temperature checked, put on my face mask, smother my hands in alcohol disinfectant and wear a pair of plastic gloves.

That's all before I have coffee.

Welcome to the Riu Concordia -- part of a hotel chain headquartered in the Spanish holiday island of Mallorca.

It's been specially chosen to greet some of the nearly 11,000 German visitors heading here as part of a pilot program to test coronavirus precautions and reopen Spain's tourism economy.

RIU Hotels has invested in a slew of new protocols.

In our lobby, a thermal camera scans guests when they walk in through the sliding doors: Keep it cool and you get the green light to enter.

But if your temperature gets too high, reception gets a discreet red alert.

""The world is going to see us as an example. A positive example,"" hotel director Sergio Navarro told CNN.

""We feel very brave to show the world our product. And people are doing a fantastic effort so far, guests are responding so well.""

Still, when an alarm goes off in the middle of my coffee, I wonder briefly if the thermal camera has caught someone sneaking in with a fever. Just a fire alarm test, as it turns out.

Hyper hygiene

CNN correspondent Atika Shubert sits down for breakfast wearing a face mask and plastic gloves.

The staff are relentlessly cheerful. When I tell my waiter I'm breakfasting alone, he congratulates me for choosing ""the safest option.""

My cutlery is safety sealed and there are signs all around reminding me to stay two meters apart from other guests.

Navigating the breakfast buffet is tricky though. I need to follow the red arrows on the floor to avoid colliding into others.

Predictably, I go the wrong way in an attempt to get to the fresh fruit.

A smiling attendant kindly guides me back towards the tempting croissants and pastries I had only narrowly escaped on the first round, but only after giving me another squirt of gel disinfectant.

""The world is going to see us as an example. A positive example,"" hotel director Sergio Navarro told CNN.

All the guests around me are German. The hotel has been booked by tour operator TUI, the world's number one tour business.

""Destination Experience Representatives"" with turquoise shirts and the smiling TUI logo mill around the lobby and pool as more reassurance for guests.

The precautions and extra care are understandable -- tourism has plummeted during the pandemic and there's a lot to prove for tour operators and hotels.

""Our first flights from Germany to Mallorca have been sold out within 36 hours and our guests enjoyed the warm welcome,"" TUI said in a statement to CNN.

""We are very pleased to be the first operator to fly holidaymakers to Mallorca again.""

On my way out of the breakfast area, I trip over the mops of no less than two aproned cleaning ladies furiously disinfecting the floors.

One of them proceeds to polish the potted palms in the lobby with alcohol spray.

All this hyper hygiene has not put a damper on the holiday vibes though.

A group of laughing young men heads to the beach toting pink and yellow inflatable beds past the disinfectant stations in the lobby.

In fact, the biggest impediment to holiday fun seems to be the sheer number of media crews desperate to tell a good news story, CNN included. A clutch of German media traveling alongside some holidaymakers has been documenting every step of their vacations.

'It's a little bit complicated'

At breakfast, diners have to follow red arrows to avoid bumping into others, and the cutlery is safely sealed.

""It's a little bit complicated how it all works,"" concedes one tourist, Rene Fuessem, as he tries to remember how many times he'd had his temperature checked.

That hasn't dimmed his enthusiasm for Mallorca.

While basking by the hotel pool, Fuessem says he especially likes the friendly staff and buffet service. All the guaranteed space makes it more enjoyable.

""The beach for example,"" he says. ""Before the beaches were full. The shops were full. Now? Nobody is there.""

Plenty of space to roll out the beach towel is nice.

The hotel is filled with sanitizing stations, including this one in the elevator.

But there's also something sad about seeing bars and clubs boarded up, their terrace chairs stacked inside.

A boardwalk that would normally be thumping with music is eerily quiet.

Across from the glittering blue of our hotel pool, we can see another shuttered hotel with brown sludge collecting inside its emptied out swimming pool.

At the boardwalk, one shop owner selling beachwear sweeps away the miniature dunes of sand that have collected at the store's doors during the lockdown.

The limited number of guests means there's plenty of space at the hotel pool.

He doesn't expect to sell anything, he says. ""I'm just bored of sitting at home.""

No-one knows how much of the economy can recover by reopening the islands to tourism again.

But the pilot program is a start.",2020-07-14,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/spain-covid-19-hotel-hygiene/index.html
Analysis Jill Disis,A new world war over technology,"Hong Kong (CNN Business) Nations and companies around the world are being sucked into a running battle over the future of technology between the United States and China, forcing them to choose sides in a conflict that is fracturing global supply chains and pushing businesses out of lucrative markets.

The latest casualty is TikTok, a video app that is popular with teenagers and which has hundreds of millions of devoted fans across markets such as India and the United States. The app is owned by a Chinese company, but run by an American CEO

The first major hit came last month, when TikTok was blocked in India after a heated border clash with China left at least 20 Indian soldiers dead. Then, on Monday, US authorities said they would look at banning the app because they consider it a possible threat to national security. That news broke as the company said it would leave Hong Kong because of concerns over a sweeping national security law China imposed on the city.

""It is becoming harder to be a truly global tech platform,"" said Dipayan Ghosh, the co-director of the Digital Platforms and Democracy Project at the Harvard Kennedy School.

The fight right now between the world's two largest economies cuts to the heart of that issue. The United States and China are competing over artificial intelligence, super-fast 5G mobile networks and other technology. Although the countries have long-running economic ties that enable some collaboration, recent tensions over national security have pushed their governments and businesses to reconsider those partnerships.

The conflict is bleeding over into the relationships those countries have with other global powers, too. The United Kingdom, for example, is re-examining its decision to grant Chinese tech company Huawei the ability to help build the country's 5G network. That review comes after the United States, which has repeatedly targeted Huawei, imposed sanctions on the company that could prevent other firms from supplying it with the chipsets it needs to build its next-generation technology.

""My impression is that the tech companies are only now waking up to the fact that life in the future is going to be a lot less globalized,"" said Michael Witt, a senior affiliate professor of strategy and international business at INSEAD, the international business school. ""They are really on the horns of a dilemma.""

A bitter rivalry

IBM IBM Microsoft MSFT The United States and China have for decades held opposing views on how to wield technology. Whileandwere driving American innovation in the 1980s, China was laying down the foundation for its Great Firewall — a massive censorship mechanism that shuts out content widely available elsewhere on the internet. In the years since then, China has created a closed and controlled internet that has found fans among other authoritarian countries: Russia, for example, has moved to restructure and rein in its once freewheeling internet with the assistance of Chinese tech

The United States has responded by seeking to limit China's advance.

The Trump administration has accused China of stealing US technology, an issue central to the damaging trade war that has colored the relationship between the two since 2018. Chinese officials have repeatedly denied such allegations and argued that any tech secrets handed over were part of deals that had been mutually agreed upon. The United States has also imposed sanctions on prominent Chinese tech firms and taken steps to limit Beijing's access to America's vast capital markets

As Washington escalates its fight against Beijing, international technological cooperation looks increasingly likely to disappear.

""Beijing has concluded that decoupling is inevitable,"" wrote Ian Bremmer and Cliff Kupchan, the president and chairman of Eurasia Group, in a report published earlier this year that noted how Chinese President Xi Jinping is calling for the country to break its technological dependence on the United States.

""China will expand efforts to reshape international technology, trade, and financial architecture to better promote its interests in an increasingly bifurcated world,"" they wrote.

Huawei is a prime example of global tech tensions. Washington has for more than a year been pressuring its allies to keep the Chinese company's equipment out of their 5G networks.

The 'virtual Berlin Wall'

As the relationship between the world's two largest economies deteriorates, several analysts warned that the fallout will have major implications for every global power, along with the tech companies that operate across their borders.

The Eurasia Group analysts wrote that the ""new virtual Berlin Wall"" will push world economies to choose sides. They said traditional US allies such as Taiwan and South Korea, for example, may tilt toward China because they supply cutting-edge semiconductors that Chinese firms rely on to compete with global rivals.

""Both the US and China have demonstrated they're willing to weaponize global trade and supply chains,"" the analysts added.

Global tensions are also causing countries to view tech firms as ""national sectors, and not global actors,"" said Samm Sacks, a senior fellow at Yale Law School's Paul Tsai China Center who studies cybersecurity and US-China relations.

""It's the idea that a tech company is going into a market on the other side of the world, and now is being asked to carry the flag of the country,"" she added. ""This is a sea change from even a decade ago.""

Huawei has perhaps become the most prominent example of that shift.

Washington has for more than a year been pressuring its allies to keep the Chinese company's telecommunications equipment out of their 5G networks. That campaign may be producing some results in Europe: UK authorities said last week that US sanctions on the company will likely hurt Huawei's viability as a 5G network provider there, while Reuters reported Thursday that Italy's largest telecom firm is excluding the company from a bid for 5G equipment.

The advancement of technology in other parts of the world also suggests that there are ""evolving, multiple playbooks"" beyond the rivalry between the United States and China, according to Kislaya Prasad, a research professor at the University of Maryland's Robert H. Smith School of Business.

Retreat or decentralize

For the tech companies stuck trying to navigate this world, there are no easy options.

Witt, the INSEAD professor, said firms must choose between giving up on part of the world, or decentralizing their operations to such a point that the company is essentially two or more different entities.

TikTok seems to be trying the second approach. While the app is owned by Beijing-based ByteDance, it has taken great pains to distance itself from its parent company. In May, it hired former Disney executive Kevin Mayer as its CEO, and it has repeatedly said that its data centers are located entirely outside of China where that data is not subject to Chinese law.

The company might be trying to make an even more dramatic break. The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday , citing a source familiar with the matter, that ByteDance is considering establishing a headquarters for the video app outside of China or a new management board to distance the service from the country. A TikTok spokesperson confirmed to CNN Business that its parent company is weighing changes to its corporate structure.

""The close connection to the Chinese government is what has shut Huawei out of so many markets,"" said Ghosh, of the Harvard Kennedy School. (Huawei maintains that it is a private firm owned by its employees.)

""I think TikTok sees that and wants to distinguish itself from Huawei,"" he added.

But that might not be enough. US lawmakers have repeatedly piled on TikTok in recent weeks. And while the company says it doesn't pose any threats to national security, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo mentioned those concerns this week when he floated the idea of banning the app

""The problem is, I think, for them it's too late,"" Witt said. ""That light of public attention, that is already brightly shining on them. I think that's not going to end well for them.""

Catherine E. Shoichet,Padma Lakshmi says this ingredient makes American food great,"(CNN) — What do ceviche, pad thai and hot dogs have in common?

They're all foods immigrants brought to the United States. And they're among the many meals featured in Padma Lakshmi's ""Taste the Nation.""

In her 10-episode series streaming on Hulu, the cookbook author, model and longtime ""Top Chef"" host is tackling a tough question.

""What exactly is American food?"" she asks in the show's opening credits. ""And what makes us American?""

Lakshmi came to the United States from India when she was 4 years old. And there's one key ingredient she argues makes American food great: immigration.

To make her case, Lakshmi travels across the United States, focusing on different cuisines -- and the people behind them -- in each episode.

She samples burritos as border surveillance helicopters hover overhead in El Paso, Texas. She dines on dosas and swaps stories about growing up Indian-American with former US Attorney Preet Bharara in New York. She cooks kabobs and wanders through Persian market aisles in Los Angeles.

And along her journey, Lakshmi points out that foods now assumed to be American have immigrant roots. As she tours Milwaukee in an episode dubbed ""The All American Weiner,"" she notes that even famed meat company founder Oscar Mayer immigrated to the United States from Germany in 1873.

Gullah Geechee cuisine in Charleston, South Carolina, Chinese cuisine in San Francisco, Native American cuisine in Arizona, Peruvian cuisine in New Jersey, Thai cuisine in Las Vegas and Japanese cuisine in Honolulu are also on the menu in this season of ""Taste the Nation.""

Lakshmi has been a vocal critic of President Trump and a prominent advocate for immigrant rights since he took office. But she's hoping her show, like the food it features, will be a bridge crossing the political divide.

""The show was designed for people who don't think like me, who don't think that immigration is a good thing and are afraid of it or threatened by it. ... I hope that this show gives them a clearer idea of what immigration feels like and looks like in a human way, on the ground, in people's daily lives,"" she says.

Lakshmi spoke with CNN this week about her own immigrant experience, how restaurants she visited are faring amid the coronavirus pandemic and the places and cuisines she'd like to explore next. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Every episode of ""Taste the Nation"" begins with you holding a photo of yourself as a 4-year-old who just immigrated to the US. What do you remember about those first days in America and what they were like for you? And how do you feel like that time shaped who you are today?

It was very exciting to come to New York as a 4-year-old from India. I was, of course, very happy to be joined with my mother. I had been separated from her for two years when I was a toddler. So that also informs my thinking about this issue.

I thought that New York was an exciting, wonderful place. I remember her taking me to the local A&P Market. And I remember thinking, ""Oh, my God. Look at all this stuff."" The shops that my grandmother and I went to in South India were really small. They had one or two choices for what you needed. So all of that abundance really made a mark on me. At that time in India in the 70s, there was one type of sliced white bread...it was a knock-off of Wonder Bread, right down to the colors and the packaging. But we walked down this bread aisle and there were at least 15-20 different choices, just from the sliced breads. I'd never seen English muffins before. All of these things were just so overwhelming.

Related content Padma Lakshmi: I could have been that immigrant child torn from her mother

And there's a moment when I go to the Tehran Market in the Persian episode (of ""Taste the Nation""), looking at everything because I've never been to a specifically Persian grocery store before. And it's the same feeling I had as a child of being totally overstimulated and not knowing where to look. It's a sort of the Disneyland of food in both instances. So I'm glad I haven't lost my childhood appreciation of a food market.

What is it like to be launching a show that focuses largely on restaurants and traveling around the US and immigration at a time when because of this pandemic, a lot of people can't travel, a lot of restaurants are struggling and immigration has basically ground to a halt?

It's very strange to be promoting anything at this time when there are so many pressing issues in our country to address. We filmed this show last summer, but it feels like a lifetime ago. I hope that the show will allow people to travel vicariously and eat out a little bit through the show and through the places I go.

What's happening to the restaurant industry is devastating. But we will rebuild. They will come back. We don't know in what form. Many will not come back. I have been in touch with a handful of the people and restaurants that we visit on the show to just check in on them and see how they're doing. Some are open for takeout. Some are open for delivery or curbside pickup. Some are still shuttered because they don't believe that they have a way to make food without putting their employees at risk.

I hope that in time of upheaval, and necessary uprising, food can be an example, a positive example of what's great about immigration and what's great about inclusivity and diversity and why we need all these different nationalities. To be able to offer them a haven and a chance at a better life will give us the ability to renew and refresh our economy and our culture. And we need that.

In a lot of episodes, you chat with people about their struggles growing up in the US and trying to walk a tightrope between two cultures. Former U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara talks about being bullied as a kid, and how he knew people growing up who'd rather be mistaken for another ethnicity than admit they were Indian. And you tell him that you changed your name briefly in high school, to Angelique. Why was it important for you to bring up that moment in your life and issues like this as part of the show?

Because I think it's telling. You know, it's a result of a symptom of not feeling totally accepted and welcome. And, you know, it's something I'm kind of embarrassed about, but it's something that I needed to reveal in order to be truthful with my own story in that episode, as much as I'm asking other people, in other episodes and communities, to be truthful about their experience and personal history.

It also allows all the people I went to high school with to know that it's me.

When you made that decision at that time to change your name, why did you do that?

I think my name is pretty easy to pronounce, maybe not my last name, but certainly my first name. But people mangle it all the time, including every teacher who ever called attendance at the beginning of each school year in each class. So it was just a way to avoid that. And it was the only thing I could think of to make me less different, more approachable, more the same. I don't know -- it certainly didn't work. I still looked like I look and still was the person I was -- and am. But I think when you're a vulnerable adolescent girl, you just want to seem non-threatening, or non-strange.

In the show, you don't gloss over some of the shameful chapters of American history that are connected to many of the rich culinary traditions that you're highlighting, like Japanese internment camps or forced migration and enslavement of people from West Africa or the Chinese Exclusion Act. Why did you decide to take that approach?

History matters. It's important to know that the foods we love have a lot of baggage attached to them, and it doesn't mean we shouldn't love them or can't appreciate them and enjoy them. But we should understand the origins of our collective cuisine in this country, because if you understand how food evolved in America, you understand how America evolved. And I think that's interesting.

I've always been a history nerd and a food nerd. So I just took a gamble that other people would find it interesting too. I did not want to do another food show that was just kind of easy, breezy and lifestyle-y, for lack of a better word. I thought there were already some of those around and they kind of bore me now. There's a lot of great food programing. I just wanted mine to be in as much as possible what I would want to watch. And it is.

In the season's finale, Lakshmi explores the influence of Japanese culture in Honolulu. Along the way, she slings fish, rolls sushi and visits vast sugar cane fields. Dominic Valente/Hulu

A theme that runs through a lot of the episodes is the relationship between mothers and daughters. And your own mom and daughter even appear in one episode. Why did you want to include them in the show?

The show highlights knowledge of culture being passed down from mothers to children because that's what actually happens in most homes, especially immigrant homes. It's the way that we connect our children to our culture the most. I felt it would have been hypocritical to ask other families and communities to be vulnerable and allow me to embed myself in their homes, in their kitchens and really ask some very deep, personal questions, without being willing to do that for my own family or life.

A lot of immigrant communities are very insular. And a lot of them don't want to talk about their own families or experiences because they have learned the hard way. They're embarrassed or they think that it's going to be ridiculed or used against them. And so asking these people -- some of whom also don't speak English fluently -- to expose themselves in this way was a big ask on my part. And because they trusted me, I needed to trust my audience. I needed to do that as well and not be guarded. And I think that the show is a success because of people's willingness to go out on a limb for me.

A childhood photo of Lakshmi with her mom, who cooks alongside her in the ""Taste the Nation"" episode focused on Indian cuisine in New York. Courtesy Padma Lakshmi

If you have a chance to do another season of ""Taste the Nation,"" what other kinds of food would you like to explore?

I'd love to go to Dearborn, Michigan, to talk to the different Arab communities there because, you know, there've been layers of immigration for the last 100 years, started by Henry Ford, who was looking for new factory workers for his auto plants.

I'd also love to go to Alaska. I shot in Alaska for a ""Top Chef"" finale years ago. And I loved it. And it's a really strange and beautiful place that not a lot of people on the mainland get to visit. And there's this huge Filipino community there. I'd really, really like to go in and discover that. The climate of Alaska year-round compared to the climate of the Philippines, that is very different. So I think that's an interesting look.

What is one thing you learned while filming ""Taste the Nation"" that really surprised you?

You know, in any food show -- ""Top Chef"" included, or ""Planet Food,"" or anything that I've done -- you always have one food that you're like, that was nice, but I don't need to eat that again. But I have to say, I did not come across that. I really, genuinely enjoyed all of the dishes I was introduced to, including the pack rat (which Lakshmi samples in the episode focusing on Native American cuisine). I was lucky, because I have no poker face.

Given all the things you learned making this show and all the many chapters of your life leading up to this moment, if you could talk to 4-year-old Padma right now or to 16-year-old Angelique, what would you tell her?",2020-07-14,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/padma-lakshmi-taste-the-nation-interview/index.html

The views expressed in this commentary are her own. Read more opinion on CNN.

(CNN) While the United States has been wrecked by domestic crises for most of 2020, the rest of the world hasn't stopped turning. Instead, many global threats -- like North Korea -- have grown in breadth and depth while the administration has scrambled to belatedly battle the Covid-19 pandemic and to deal with domestic divisions and the outcry over police brutality and systemic racism. Concurrently, while President Donald Trump has been waging a war on his perceived political enemies, tensions between China and India , two nuclear armed powers, have escalated with fatal consequences.

These twin conflicts in Asia present serious challenges for US national security at a time when the President seems mostly focused on attacking his former national security advisor , John Bolton, and saying whatever he thinks will score him campaign support. That approach forebodes a continued lack of any semblance of a coherent, informed strategy when it comes to dealing with security issues in Asia.

For years, Trump has treated North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Un, like a key foreign policy surrogate. He has inaccurately pointed to his relationship with Kim and small concessions North Korea made, like releasing prisoner remains , as a sign that he's made progress on North Korean denuclearization. Now, Trump's preferred foreign policy surrogate may be his biggest liability.

While Kim has continued to develop his illegal nuclear program and other conventional capabilities at a quick pace, despite summiting with Trump and becoming his preferred pen pal, North Korea has recently upped the ante on direct threats to the US and our allies.

Verbal insults are flying out of Pyongyang, including from Kim Jong Un's sister, Kim Yo-jong, who accused the President of South Korea, Moon Jae-in, of ""pro-US flunkeyism."" This is a far cry from the inter-Korean warmth displayed at Moon's previous summits with Kim Jong Un. Escalation on the Korean peninsula, where the US has thousands of troops stationed with their families, is a reality now. And, if Trump's past is prologue, there's no certainty that he'll side with our ally, South Korea, if Kim continues his dangerous behavior on the peninsula.

It was clear that denuclearization was nothing more than a pipe dream long ago -- and Kim has more recently publicly vowed to increase North Korea's nuclear ""deterrent."" Kim's not denuclearizing and may be backtracking on demilitarizing. The risk of direct, physical confrontation on the Korean peninsula is more of a reality as is a direct North Korean attack on US democracy.

While North Korea's destabilizing actions have only increased in the last few months -- they are clearly aware that Trump is desperate to cling to Kim as he heads into the election, and they may be trying to pressure him into giving Kim concessions to maintain some semblance of ""success"" with North Korea.

They know Trump prioritizes his political agenda over policy priorities, and they may be trying to provoke him into giving them what they want -- sanctions relief -- in exchange for cooling it during his campaign.

While Trump's administration figures out how to respond to the chaos created by Kim -- not to mention ongoing bilateral tensions with China -- there has also been a direct physical altercation between India and China. At least 20 Indian soldiers were killed on Monday in the Galwan Valley -- an area controlled by China but claimed by both countries. India and China went to war over this strip of land in 1962 after which a tenuous status quo has existed.

This isn't the first time those tensions have escalated, but the casualties earlier this week mark the bloodiest episode in Sino-Indian relations in decades as both countries have accused each other of not respecting the line of actual control (LAC) which serves as a de facto border. Both sides have reportedly militarily reinforced their positions in the area despite attempts to de-escalate tensions. While the strip of land in question is small and relatively inhospitable, it does hold strategic importance to both countries.

Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, has proven himself willing to stand up to China's regional ambitions. He's been clear that he won't let India be bullied by China . Furthermore, both leaders have politics at play -- backing down from a nationalist agenda item could come with costs for them at home. While Indian and Chinese officials met Thursday to discuss escalation, there are calls in India for retribution against China

And, while officials on both sides battle it out verbally, something's got to give because, as we have seen, the use of force is totally on the table. An off ramp is urgently needed because both countries are probably looking for a way out. Not only are they still battling Covid-19 and facing economic uncertainties, but they need an off ramp that allows them to save face domestically. Doing that will require careful diplomatic calibration in terms of concessions for any loss of life and a coordinated de-escalation of military assets in the area.

While the State Department tries to deal with Chinese aggression on multiple fronts, they also have to contend with the fact that Trump will say or do whatever he thinks is most politically expedient. Trump even undercut Pompeo on trade issues with China by tweeting on Thursday and he's been all over the map on other China-related issues like Hong Kong, the Uighurs and more.

These twin crises in Asia mean that during these final months of Trump's term, his track record on foreign policy is resoundingly clear. The President has exposed the US to more risks from North Korea, not less, while also turning the country into the weakest link when it comes to trying to resolve global conflicts. We have Trump to thank for all of that, and it's no wonder that leaders like Kim Jong Un and Xi Jinping think they can act with impunity.",2020-06-20,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/20/opinions/trump-china-india-asia-korea-vinograd/index.html
Oren Liebermann,"Israel had coronavirus firmly in its grasp, only to see it slip away","Jerusalem (CNN) For months, Israel appeared to be an international model of coronavirus success.

With early travel restrictions and sweeping closures, the Startup Nation had largely contained the spread of Covid-19, recording a mortality rate that was far better than many countries in the Western world. As coronavirus tore across the United States and Europe, Israel was comfortably moving towards reopening.

Lest there be any doubt about who led the country through these difficult times, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu routinely held evening press conferences to remind everyone, warning about the newest challenges and taking credit for the latest victories.

He predicted Israel would set an example in restarting the economy as well.

Analysis Nick Paton Walsh,Iran's Natanz nuclear facility fire raises questions,"(CNN) It is the world's most scrutinized shed. Exactly what happened to an outer building at an Iranian nuclear facility means both everything and nothing, as Tehran grapples with protecting its regional clout during the twin ravages of the coronavirus and US sanctions.

The Natanz nuclear plant lost a building when fire tore through it at 2:06 a.m. local time Thursday. Satellite images beefed up the photos from ground level that slowly led Iranian officials to switch from calling the damage at the facility ""limited"" to ""significant.""

The plant has a florid history: It was the target of Israel's Stuxnet cyber attack in 2010, an attack experts believe was carried out by Israel and the United States, and a focus of the uranium enrichment activity Iran has recently restarted at a higher level since the JCPOA (or nuclear deal) finally collapsed last year. This makes its even partial damage hard to simply dismiss as a broken generator in the summer heat.

The fire came in the middle of a series of unexplained incidents at other facilities. A huge blast hit near the town of Parchin and its military complex last month. Another explosion hit the Zargan power plant in Ahvaz over the weekend and hours later, a chlorine gas leak made dozens ill in southeast Iran. There is such a thing as coincidence, and sanctions mean maintenance issues can be more frequent. But the pattern just added to the speculation around Natanz.

Iran's on-the-record response -- which admitted nothing bar claiming to know the ""main cause"" -- perhaps was the most telling, that it would detail the cause when it suited. You might assess that a government dealing with economic difficulties, a persistent pandemic and crippling sanctions, would have preferred to sweep this incident under the carpet, were it just incompetence or an accident. Instead, it has chosen to amplify and prolong the suspicions.

Allyssia Alleyne,The fashion industry says it stands against racism. Critics aren't buying it,"Since May 26, headlines have been dominated by the killing of George Floyd and the international protests it has ignited. Thousands have taken to the streets around the world to denounce police brutality and anti-blackness, while online, thousands more have posted en masse in support of #BlackLivesMatter (BLM) and called for an end to systemic racism.

On social media, many fashion brands were quick to align themselves with protesters, posting black squares to Instagram on #BlackoutTuesday, and sharing lengthy captions denouncing racism, discrimination and violence. But not everyone was buying it.

""Plain and simple, I don't think there is the intention behind it to make long-lasting, sustainable change,"" Teen Vogue editor-in-chief Lindsay Peoples Wagner said in an email to CNN. ""Everyone can hop onto the BLM movement right now on social media, but what are you doing in your home, in your corporate office, with your connections, with the power you have?""

Charges of hypocrisy have plagued brands since the onset of the protests. On social media, commenters questioned whether the luxury brand Salvatore Ferragamo, who declined to comment for this story, could be an ally in the fight against racism when actor Tommy Dorfman accused them of discriminating against trans models and models of color in a recent campaign; or whether LA label Reformation could truly support #BlackLivesMatter when people claiming to be former employees were accusing the brand of workplace racism in the comments (founder Yael Aflalo has apologized and resigned from her post as chief executive officer); or whether Anthropologie could genuinely claim ""Our hearts, with yours, are breaking at current events,"" as they did in a since-deleted Instagram post, when they've been accused of racial profiling their customers -- allegations that the brand has denied

This is to say nothing of the backlash against fashion publications. Earlier this month, a CNN investigation unearthed numerous allegations of racism and workplace toxicity at Refinery29. In response to these accusations, editor-in-chief and co-founder Christene Barberich -- who resigned on June 8 -- said in a statement, ""My goal has always been to help close the representation gap and I believe that is reflected across the pages of Refinery29.""

Meanwhile, Anna Wintour was briefly rumored to be stepping down from her vaunted post at Vogue , as former staffers and talent shared their own experiences with racism at the magazine.

Wintour, whose official title names her as artistic director and editor-in-chief of Vogue US and global content advisor, sent an internal email to her staff on June 5. In the memo, seen by CNN, she acknowledged and took ""full responsibility"" for the racism that flourished under her watch: ""I know Vogue has not found enough ways to elevate and give space to Black editors, writers, photographers, designers and other creators. We have made mistakes too, publishing images or stories that have been hurtful or intolerant,"" she wrote.

Additionally, a spokesperson for Condé Nast, Vogue's publisher, said in a statement, ""Condé Nast is focused on creating meaningful, sustainable change and continues to implement an inclusive hiring process to ensure that a diverse range of candidates is considered for all open positions.""

It was French luxury brand Celine's Instagram response -- a black square with a caption reading, ""Celine stands against all forms of discrimination, oppression and racism. Tomorrow's world will not exist without equality for all #BlackLivesMatter"" -- that caused Hollywood stylist Jason Bolden, whose celebrity clients include Taraji P. Henson, Ava DuVernay and Serena Williams, to pause his scrolling. In a pointed comment that was later picked up by industry watchdog account Diet Prada , Bolden accused the brand, who declined to comment for this story, of not dressing Black celebrities for the red carpet unless they were working with White stylists.

""My focus has not been on fashion; my focus has been on lives being lost and the injustice (facing) Black people,"" Bolden said in a phone interview. ""But in that particular moment when I saw that go across my feed, it just sparked my rage. It just felt like a joke to me. It didn't feel authentic.""

As a stylist, Bolden said he's often felt marginalized by high fashion brands. He recalls struggling to find a designer to dress Henson for the 2017 Academy Awards, where her film ""Hidden Figures"" was nominated for three awards, including Best Picture. ""These are the exact same brands that I would see dressing talent who no one had ever heard of, and they were all White girls,"" said Bolden.

""And in those moments, what else are you supposed to lean into? (Henson) has everything they could possibly want. She has the press that goes along with (the Oscar nominations), she has the major coverage, she's presenting, she's won a Golden Globe... she's in critically acclaimed movies. And yet they said no.""

“ But in that particular moment when I saw that go across my feed, it just sparked my rage. It just felt like a joke to me. It didn't feel authentic. ” Jason Bolden

""I think what we're seeing is people like myself who are tired of people and brands not walking the talk,"" said Peoples Wagner. ""It's very easy for people to tap into a moment and say they care about an issue, but people have been doing that for years without making real systemic changes, and that's what's being demanded of brands now.""

This isn't the first time the fashion industry has stumbled when it comes to addressing issues of race. Cultural appropriation, high-profile racist gaffes and the lack of runway diversity are perennial talking points, leading to a recent wave of diversity and inclusion hires. Peoples Wagner is one of few Black editors at the helm of a major fashion magazine (along with British Vogue's Edward Enninful, and Harper's Bazaar's newly appointed editor, Samira Nasr , who will officially begin next month), and there are only two Black designers at the helm of European fashion houses.

""I don't know if any White person is even able to relate to the emotional turmoil that is being Black and trying to have a business here and trying to survive (in this industry)... I don't know if there's any sector in fashion where Black people can say we have the same resources, we're equal, we're treated the same,"" said model Adesuwa Aighewi , one of the most high-profile Black models working today.

Having walked the runway and fronted campaigns for some of the world's most renowned luxury brands and appeared on the April 2020 cover of Vogue, Aighewi said she sees her ""entire career"" as part of the industry's recent -- if still limited -- efforts to increase model diversity in magazines and on the runway after years of criticism. ""Literally everything that I've done has been as the face of my race and as a diversity token. I shot the cover of American Vogue in December, and yet I don't see any of the companies that so proudly paraded me around having meaningful dialogue about Black Lives Matter.""

Danielle Prescod, style director for BET.com, wasn't surprised to see brands suddenly speaking up against racism in the aftermath of Floyd's killing. ""(With) something that was moving as quickly as this movement was through social media, it would have been so glaring if people didn't say anything,"" she said.

“ Literally everything that I've done has been as the face of my race and as a diversity token. ” Adesuwa Aighewi

However, she couldn't help but question the motivation when brands that had previously remained silent on issues of race, or hadn't previously prioritized inclusion and diversity, chose this moment to speak up.

""It does come across as disingenuous when a brand says something like 'We stand with the Black community.' It's like, when have you ever stood with the Black community?"" she said. ""You have had the same opportunities to defend Black lives, to defend Black beauty, to employ Black people from the onset of your business. So for you this week to decide that you do (care about Black lives) is all too convenient. It ends up looking like a marketing opportunity rather than something that they truly care about.""

Indeed, now more than ever, aligning one's brand with popular causes can make for good strategy. According to the 2020 State of Fashion Report, compiled by management consulting giant McKinsey & Company and trade publication the Business of Fashion, almost two-thirds of consumers identify as ""'belief-driven buyers' who will choose, switch, avoid or boycott a brand based on its stand on societal issues."" Because of this, the report predicted that more companies will ""elevate diversity and inclusion as a higher priority.""

At a time when 74% of Americans support the protests, according to a recent Washington Post-Schar School poll, siding with protestors -- even in a superficial way -- means siding with popular opinion.

""If you look at how brands rally around causes, it's usually popular causes and the causes of the majority, because what you're trying to do is align your brand with customer values. So you now have a customer who judges your brand not as an entity, but as a person or personality,"" said Martin Raymond, co-founder of trend-forecasting consultancy The Future Laboratory.

""Traditionally, it was useful for brands to sit on the fence but, increasingly, if you sit on the fence, you risk getting splinters on your bottom. You end up not really understanding the pendulum of history and where it's swinging, and where you need to be when that pendulum passes over you.""

However, by aligning themselves with a cause, brands open themselves up to increased consumer scrutiny and criticism, which can be problematic when their pledges contradict their practices. Raymond points to the ongoing conversations around fashion brands' sustainability efforts, which have often been panned as ""greenwashing"": ""If I examined your infrastructure, your logistics chain or your sourcing -- particularly in fashion -- I would find quite strange things sitting there that would be readily available for criticism and for challenge.""

However, Bethann Hardison, a former model, turned modeling agent and diversity advocate, is less cynical. ""When people offer their solidarity, I don't tend to question it... I don't have time for that. We have a movement to keep moving,"" she said.

""These big companies, a lot of them are very good people and they do care to do the right thing, but they're used to being who they've been. Now, this is an opportunity for people to wake up and look and notice that something different is happening around them and happening to them.""

For brands who, historically, haven't had to think critically about race and social justice -- or address the issues of racism in their own teams -- a learning curve is to be expected. ""Some people are being challenged for the first time to talk about race openly.""

“ When people offer their solidarity, I don't tend to question it... I don't have time for that. We have a movement to keep moving ” Bethann Hardison

Some brands have been better at establishing solidarity than others. Bolden has praised Valentino designer Pierpaolo Piccioli for his multicultural casting and for making South Sudanese-Australian model Adut Akech the de facto face of the brand. Similarly, Prescod commends plus-size luxury e-retailer 11 Honoré for its commitment to using diverse models on their platform and on Instagram. (""You won't go two scrolls without seeing a Black face,"" Prescod observed.)

Hardison points to Gucci as an example of a brand making promising steps to address the lack of representation in fashion. In 2019, the Italian brand, which had faced backlash for insensitive designs and co-opting the designs of Black designer Dapper Dan, launched their Changemakers Impact Fund. Last October, the fund launched a $1.5 million diversity scholarship program to ""to ensure a new era of diverse and exceptional young people will gain opportunities and experiences across the fashion industry."" And, on June 3, the company announced it would be donating to the NAACP, Campaign Zero (a non-profit that works to end police brutality) and Colin Kaepernick's Know Your Rights Camp. Gucci also paused US operations on June 4 ""for employees to have a day of mourning, honor the lives lost, and recommit ourselves to being part of the solution.""

But truly entrenching anti-racist values into one's business requires dramatic change at the top, where decision-making power lies. In its 2019 report on inclusion and diversity in the industry, the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) stated that focusing on visibility -- such as diversity on the runway or on magazine covers -- is not enough: ""The industry must recognize and prioritize efforts to support greater diversity on the business side: the financiers, the chief executives, the heads of fashion houses, the senior level magazine editors, and business leaders,"" wrote Erica Lovett, the director of inclusion and diversity at publisher Condé Nast. ""Until fashion leaders across all categories become more diverse, we will continue to only progress at the surface level.""

Research suggests that diverse hiring is more than just a matter of good optics: it's good business. A 2018 McKinsey study found that companies with high levels of ethnic and cultural diversity on executive teams were 33% more likely to have ""industry-leading profitability.""

""People have been saying for years the steps that need to be taken: create a pipeline for BIPOC (Black, Indigenous and people of color) talent, make sure that pipeline gives way for leadership positions so you don't just have a ton of BIPOC assistants and freelancers, etc.,"" Peoples Wagner said. ""Inclusivity isn't as hard as people make it seem. It just has to be a committed, company-wide decision, and not a choice unilaterally.""

Hardison views this moment as ""a first step"" in a larger fight for change and predicts that today's unrest will lead to ""ample changes"" in the future. (She's not the only one: in a recent interview , civil rights activist and scholar Angela Davis said, ""This particular historical conjecture holds possibilities for change that we've never before experienced in this country."")

Aighewi is similarly optimistic but acknowledges that genuine change won't come easily. ""People need to actually do the work: get uncomfortable, have these conversations, admit that the system is not correct,"" she said.

""These companies have been around long enough. This is not the first time Black people have complained about the fashion industry; this isn't the first revolution. Something's got to give.""",2020-07-14,https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/fashion-industry-black-lives-matter/index.html
Oscar Holland,Francis Bacon painting sells for $84M at first-of-its-kind virtual auction,"Written by Oscar Holland, CNN

Francis Bacon triptych sold for over $84 million during a virtual auction at Sotheby's, on what was an encouraging -- and highly unusual -- evening for the coronavirus-hit art market.

With an auctioneer live-streaming from London, and telephone bids beamed in from New York and Hong Kong, the painter's 1981 artwork ""Triptych Inspired by the Oresteia of Aeschylus"" exceeded pre-sale estimates of between $60 million and $80 million.

Monday evening's marathon sale marked the first time that Sotheby's has trialed its ""hybrid"" auction format, which saw chairman of Sotheby's Europe, Oliver Barker, taking bids from agents around the world via a wall of screens. In a press statement Barker described the experience as ""like being at the epicenter of a cinematic production.""

Bidders were also able to make offers online, with the 10-minute battle for Bacon's painting ending in a two-horse race between a web user in China and an unidentified telephone bidder. The final price tag of $84.6 million, offered by the latter, marks the third-highest sum ever paid for the artist's work at auction, according to Sotheby's.

There were other positive signs at the evening event, which consisted of three separate sales. Roy Lichtenstein's ""White Brushstroke I"" went for $25.4 million, while Jean-Michel Basquiat 's ""Untitled (Head)"" achieved $15.2 million, a new world auction record for a work on paper by the artist.

The evening generated a total of $363.2 million for Sotheby's, with 93% of the artworks offered eventually selling. According to Gregoire Billault, head of the auction house's contemporary art department in New York, it bodes well for the coming months.

""Tonight was a very clear demonstration that, even in very difficult times, if you come up with the right (artworks) at the right prices, the market is there,"" he said over the phone shortly after the sale, admitting that staging the auction in the current climate had been ""a risk.""

""It's definitely going to influence what we're going to do in the future,"" he added. ""Whether we're going to repeat (this exact format) I don't know, but we know it's possible and that it works.""

Difficulties remain

Yet, these remain troubling times for an industry that has been severely hampered by the inability to stage live sales. With lockdowns around the world forcing auction houses to cancel and postpone events, Sotheby's has already furloughed and laid off staff amid a collapse in revenues.

Despite efforts to boost digital offerings in recent months, the top end of the art market is still heavily dependent on live sales and in-person viewings. Proceeds from online-only auctions represent relative pocket-change for the big houses -- just $80 million of the total $4.8 billion generated by Sotheby's in 2019 came via the web.

How do art auctions really work?

The auction house has, nonetheless, made efforts to compensate for the lack of physical events. Its ""Contemporary"" sale set a new online record in April when it generated more than $6.4 million through works by the likes of Andy Warhol and Damien Hirst. The $1.3 million paid for George Condo's ""Antipodal Reunion"" may have represented just a fraction of the sums seen on Monday evening, but it was the most Sotheby's has ever raised for an artwork through online-only bidding.

But while the apparent success of this ""hybrid"" auction will no doubt come as a relief, there remain questions around the appetite for blue-chip art amid a global economic downturn. Moreover, the Bacon painting was consigned long before the pandemic took hold in the West, meaning that potential buyers were able to view the artwork up close in Hong Kong and London prior to the sale.

Whether potential sellers will still want to put multi-million-dollar art on sale in the current climate -- or whether buyers will splash out on big-ticket items they cannot inspect in person -- remains to be seen.

Billault nonetheless struck an upbeat chord, saying that Sotheby's had still been able ""to consign amazing works during the Covid period.""

""We have sent a signal to the art market after all these difficult times, with fairs canceled and museums closed,"" he said, adding: ""It's a vote of confidence both for sellers and buyers.""

Helen Jennings,Vintage family pictures inspired this Nigerian photographer's latest work,"Written by Helen Jennings, CNN

For his latest project, Nigerian photographer Oye Diran looked to his old family photos for inspiration. He was especially taken by the elegant clothing his parents used to wear, including his mother in classic Nigerian iro and buba style (a wrapped skirt and tailored top) -- often paired with a gele (headwrap).

""I was struck by how appealing and rich these outfits looked and was reminded of how well my parents and their friends were attired when I was young,"" Diran wrote over email from where he now lives in New York. ""The relevance of iro and buba doesn't dissipate over time, so I came up with this story to shed light on the beauty of my heritage to the world.""

Diran went on to research more imagery from Nigeria in the 1960s to 1980s, before recreating the same vintage feeling for ""A Ti De"" (""We Have Arrived""), featuring portraits of three women dancing, posing and having a good time. ""Yoruba people are known to find any reason to dress up and celebrate,"" he said, referring to Nigeria's second-largest ethnic group. ""Traditional weddings, for example, are an opportunity to wear your finest iro and buba, add accessories, and show out,"" he said.

From the optimism that followed independence from Britain in 1960, through a devastating civil war and subsequent military coups, the period that this project draws from was a seismic and formative one for Nigeria. This was reflected in the country's cultural landscape and ideas around dress. While Fela Kuti incited rebellion and preached pan-Africanism, Lagos' most stylish residents mixed up local fashion with western silhouettes. This speaks to today's Nigerian image-makers, who draw on the past to comment on neo-colonialism and redefine black beauty, such as Lakin Ogunbanwo , Ruth Ossai and Diran.

Diran originally studied business and worked in event production before finding his calling as a photographer a decade ago. He taught himself the skill and has gone on to hone a minimalist yet warm aesthetic, citing renowned West African photographers J.D. Okhai Ojeikere , Malick Sidibé and Seydou Keïta as influences. ""These legends depicted the excellence of their culture. I'm inspired by the set designs, styling and conceptual poses of their portraits.""

Ojeikere's celebrated archive documenting the intricate hairstyles and headwear of Nigerian women is echoed not only in ""A Ti De,"" but Diran's ongoing series ""Gele,"" which captures regal matriarchs in opulent settings with elaborately tied headwraps acting as their crowns. ""I began the series in 2017 as a way to interpret the symbolic meaning of geles and express the splendour of African women,"" he said.

Diran's fashion and art photos have featured in both Vogue Italia and Afropunk, and his work was included in an exhibition at the United Nations in 2018. This year, his photo ""Makub,"" featuring a woman's delicate face and hands in an infinite pastel pink expanse, won a LensCulture Exposure award. ""'Maktub' is an Arabic word meaning 'it is written'. It is the idea that our destinies are pre-ordained but still have to be pursued,"" he said.

This year the photo ""Makub"" won Diran a LensCulture Exposure award. Credit: Oye Diran

Since it debuted in March on global African media platform Nataal , Diran has received plenty of responses to ""A Ti De,"" and its nostalgic appeal. ""The feedback has been overwhelmingly positive from Nigerians at home and across the diaspora,"" he said.

""People have expressed a sense of pride, inspiration and empowerment that the project has given them."" This ties into Diran's wider sense of duty to create images that speak to a positive, pan-African perspective.

""I want to continue to convey the essence of African or black ideologies while breaking down misconstrued narratives of these cultures,"" he said. ""I want to be part of the global force illuminating the culture from a diasporic perspective. And most importantly, telling the many truths that are overlooked and more often, silenced. I feel that it is our collective responsibility as African photographers to do so.""",2020-07-14,https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/a-ti-de-oye-diran-photography/index.html
Ananda Pellerin,Remember when the women of Twin Peaks made nostalgia new again?,"Written by Ananda Pellerin, CNN

Before Netflix, before sagas like ""Game of Thrones"" -- before high-speed internet -- there was ""Twin Peaks.""

It's not a stretch to say that without ""Twin Peaks,"" there would be no ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" no ""Riverdale,"" and, arguably, no ""Gilmore Girls."" Setting the blueprint for edgy TV drama, David Lynch's trailblazing police procedural, which first aired 30 years ago on April 8, 1990, brought gothic Americana into the mainstream.

Equal parts ""Twilight Zone"" and ""Dynasty,"" ""Twin Peaks"" was a departure from the conventional plot lines of popular prime-time dramas like ""L.A. Law"" and ""MacGyver."" Its legacy transcends its short run (two seasons, until a third was released in 2017) and cult status, creeping onto the covers of Time and Rolling Stone, and into water cooler conversations around the world.

But it wasn't only the unsolved mystery of who killed homecoming queen Laura Palmer that kept viewers coming back to the haunting -- and haunted -- West Coast town, teeming with backstabbing, sexual escapades and a fabled ""darkness"" lurking in the nearby woods. Shot on film, the show had a cinematic feel that was unusual for TV at the time, with Lynch's signature psychosexual surrealism (seen in earlier indie releases like ""Blue Velvet"" and ""Eraserhead"") ratcheting up the tension of each visually and emotionally saturated scene.

This tone owes a huge debt to the show's costuming, helmed by long-time Lynch collaborator Patricia Norris. Simple staples from decades past were updated and worn with modern ease, while trends that would define the next decade could be glimpsed in their infancy, making ""Twin Peaks"" a period piece outside time.

There was no shortage of compelling characters with distinct looks. From coffee-obsessed FBI special agent Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) in his beige trench coat and brill-creamed officer's cut, to Hawaiian shirted psychiatrist Dr Jacoby (Russ Tamblyn), to the all-seeing Log Lady (Catherine E Coulson) in her red-framed glasses.

The women in particular embodied the town's twin spirits of repression and desire, and none more than pot-stirring teenager Audrey Horne (Sherilyn Fenn). The daughter of scheming businessman Benjamin Horne, Audrey is bored, imaginative, and doesn't care what anyone thinks. When we first find her sulking around her father's wood-paneled Great Northern Hotel, eagerly terrifying a group of Norwegian businessmen with her morbid recounting of the recent town killing, she epitomizes 1950s girlhood in saddle shoes and a pink angora sweater, tucked into a plaid skirt.

It comes as no surprise, then, when we later see Audrey trading her flats for red kitten heels stashed in her school locker, or cooly smoking in the girls' bathroom, with her A-frame eyebrows and figure-hugging sweater, setting the type of scene that pushed lobbyists to pressure Hollywood to stop letting actors smoke on screen -- because it just looked too good. Or, in a moment that made TV history, Audrey, poured into a svelte little black dress, twists a cherry stem into a knot with her tongue.

Veronica on ""Riverdale"" is an obvious heir to Audrey's teen vamp persona, but so, too, is '90s Courtney Love, with her broken-down pin-up look; the independent and spirited Rory and Lorelai of ""Gilmore Girls,"" with some jeans and MAC lipstick thrown in; and ""Glee""'s gutsy and seductive cheerleader Santana.

At the other end of the mid-century spectrum is Donna, the town doctor's good-hearted daughter, cut from the finest girl-next-door cloth. Even as she breaks into tears in the middle of class, suddenly aware that something terrible has happened to her best friend Laura, it's hard not to be distracted by her impeccably manicured nails.

But Lynch's nostalgia didn't end with the 1950s. Norma, owner of the Double R diner (played by Peggy Lipton of ""Bewitched"" and ""The Mod Squad"" fame) updates the working-class diner look on ""Alice,"" which ran from 1974 until 1985, bringing the elegance of a ballgown to her blue-and-white uniform, replete with integrated apron and leg-of-mutton sleeves.

Similarly, Josie Packard (Joan Chen), the phenomenally chic widow of the town's previous mill owner, exudes pure glamour. With immaculately red-stained lips and crop of jet-black hair, she bridges the gap between 1980s power suits and the more relaxed tailoring that would take hold in the '90s. Josie always looks straight off the runway, whether she's donning a green silk bathrobe, a red sweater dress, or high-waisted check trousers paired with a structural brown cardigan (arguably the best outfit in the series).

There were only eight episodes in the first season of Twin Peaks, but it was enough to set off the 1990s on a stylish, precient note. The wool sweaters, wool cardigans, wool tights, A-line skirts and plaid, plaid, plaid would soon after be reflected in Seattle grunge and ""Clueless"" cuteness , while the show's lack of fashion accessories and short hair on women would become part of the decade's minimalist style code.

And while season two was full of its own pleasant surprises -- DEA agent and trans woman Denise Bryson, played by David Duchovny, arrives in town -- and the reboot gave fans a long overdue hit of small-town weirdness, 30 years on there remains something special about those first eight episodes, a magical quality that has yet to be replicated.",2020-07-14,https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/remember-when-twin-peaks-david-lynch/index.html

CNN Style has launched a dedicated Beauty section. Read more Beauty stories here.

In 1912 thousands of supporters of the suffrage movement marched past the New York salon of Elizabeth Arden. The cosmetics brand founder, who had just opened her business two years earlier, was a supporter of women's rights, and she aligned herself with the cause by handing out tubes of bright red lipstick to the marching women.

Suffrage leaders Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Charlotte Perkins Gilman loved red lipstick for its ability to shock men, and protesters donned the bold color en masse, adopting it as a sign of rebellion and liberation.

""There could not be a more perfect symbol of suffragettes than red lipstick, because it's not just powerful, it's female,"" said Rachel Felder, author of last year's ""Red Lipstick: An Ode to a Beauty Icon,"" in a phone interview. ""Suffragettes were about female strength, not just strength.""

Throughout the centuries red lipstick has signaled many things, from its early use by the elite in ancient Egypt and by prostitutes in ancient Greece, to its status in early Hollywood as a symbol of glamor. In its many hues, this color on lips has been a mighty cultural weapon, charged with thousands of centuries of meaning. ""Red lipstick is truly a way to trace cultural history and societal zeitgeist,"" Felder said.

Until lipstick was popularized in the early 20th century, red lips were often associated with morally dubious women: impolite, sexually amoral, even heretical. In the Dark Ages, red lips were seen as a sign of commingling with the devil. The makeup ""was associated with this mysterious, frightening femininity,"" Felder said.

Then, Felder's book explains, as the American suffrage movement adopted red lips, their international counterparts did, too.

As women's rights movements spread across Europe, New Zealand and Australia, with British and American organizers often sharing tactics, from organizing marches, to hunger strikes, to more aggressive militant strategies. And this solidarity extended to their makeup. Inspired by her American counterparts, British suffragette leader Emmeline Pankhurst favored a red lip, which helped spread the symbolic gesture among her fellow activists.

Though suffragettes popularized the red-lip look in their day, Felder notes that there was already momentum to normalize lipstick among women more generally, as they dropped restrictive corsets for brassieres, and started to adopt more streamlined silhouettes, designed by the likes of Coco Chanel.

After the suffragettes wore red lipstick, the exuberant flappers of the Roaring Twenties followed suit. And while suffragettes may not have been solely responsible for popularizing a painted lip, they embodied the idea of the ""modern woman"" in Europe and America, Felder pointed out.

During World War II, red lips had their bold second act of defiance. Adolf Hitler ""famously hated red lipstick,"" Felder said. In Allied countries, wearing it became a sign of patriotism and a statement against facism. When taxes made lipstick prohibitively expensive in the UK, women stained their lips with beet juice instead.

As men went off to war and women filled their professional roles back home, they donned red lips to enter the workforce. It showed their resilience in the face of conflict, Felder explained, and offered a sense of normalcy in difficult times. ""It allowed women to retain a sense of their own self-identity from before the war."" J. Howard Miller's illustration of Rosie the Riveter, the cultural icon who was used to recruit and empower American female factory workers, notably had cherry-daubed lips.

In 1941 and for the duration of the war, red lipstick became mandatory for women who joined the US Army. Beauty brands had capitalized on the wartime trend, with Elizabeth Arden releasing ""Victory Red"" and Helena Rubenstein introducing ""Regimental Red,"" among others. But it was Arden who the American government asked to create a regulation lip and nail color for serving women. Her ""Montezuma Red"" matched and accentuated their uniforms' red piping.

""Wearing red lipstick for a woman in that era was so linked to... a sense of feminine self-esteem,"" particularly, ""resilient and strong female self-esteem,"" said Felder, who has herself worn the beauty staple nearly every day since high school. After the war, classic Hollywood actresses like Elizabeth Taylor added a layer of glamour to the confident look.

Today, other protest symbols for women's empowerment have become widespread, notably the pink pussy hat that dominated the 2017 Women's March; and the habit from ""The Handmaid's Tale"" which has been worn internationally for women's causes, including pro-choice demonstrations.

Yet red lips still pack a punch. In a viral image from 2015, a Macedonian woman kissed an officer's riot shield during an anti-government protest, leaving a red kiss mark in a poignant moment of rebellion.

In 2018 in Nicaragua, women and men wore red lipstick and uploaded photos of themselves to social media to show their support for the release of anti-government protesters. They were reacting to activist Marlén Chow, who defied her interrogators by applying red lipstick.

Last December, nearly 10,000 women in Chile took to the streets wearing black blindfolds, red scarves, and red lips to denounce sexual violence in the country.

By wearing red lips, protesters all over the world have tapped into the same power the suffrage movement once plumbed a century earlier. In this bold, defiant beauty statement, their legacy lives on.

Craigh Barboza,These films explore black lives impacted by white authority,"Written by Craigh Barboza

Craigh Barboza teaches film journalism at New York University and writes about race, entertainment and culture.

Following the wave of demonstrations sparked by the killing of George Floyd, many of us have been thinking about the history of race in America, and the ongoing narrative of police violence. We are all looking for resources to help better understand the moment.

Each of the movies below offers a different perspective on how African Americans have contended with white authority over the decades and centuries. They both speak to and echo what is happening now.

The films range from underground classics to big-studio productions, all of which put a human face on timely and difficult social justice issues that have shifted the conversation on racial equality in America in a way that only movies can do.

If you've seen the films on this list, you can rewatch them in a new light. And if it's your first time, you might recognize something that resonates with the hundreds of Black Lives Matter and anti-racism protests that have erupted worldwide calling for wide-reaching reform.

""Harriet"" (2019)

""Harriet"" Credit: Martin Chase Productions

Kasi Lemmons' recent biopic portrays the famed abolitionist Harriet Tubman (Cynthia Erivo) as a young, gun-toting heroine prepared to die for the freedom of her people. Starting out in 1849, ""Harriet"" explores the monstrous institution of slavery and how it seeped into American law enforcement in the form of marshals and paid trackers -- sometimes seen as glorified slave catchers.

""What you see in the movie are these armed posses that are after black people,"" said Donald Bogle, the film historian and author of ""Hollywood Black,"" via email.

""There's that sequence on the bridge when Harriet is cornered, after an escape, and she says, 'I'm going to be free or die' and jumps into the river. I think we can draw a connection to what's happening today and a system of pursuers, these violent white men who, in some ways, are sanctioned to murder us.""

Erivo's breakout performance as Tubman (she was a double-Oscar nominee last year for best actress and original song) is worth the price of streaming alone. After making it to Philadelphia, she joins the Underground Railroad, where she becomes its most famous conductor. We learn about the prophetic visions that helped her lead approximately 70 enslaved people to freedom, as well as Tubman's command of a black army that freed 150 more in the Combahee River Raid.

""Harriet"" underscores the important role African American women have played in history, and how they continue to suffer discrimination and persecution. ""We've had these instances, like Sandra Bland, who was stopped by the cops for something so minor and, we have it on film -- the way the cop spoke to her and she spoke back -- and she was taken into custody and ended up dead ,"" Bogle said. ""There's this idea that this whole system violates African American men but it can do this to African American women as well.""

""Rosewood"" (1997)

""Rosewood"" Credit: Warner Bros.

John Singleton's ""Rosewood"" tells the true story of how, in 1923, a prosperous black town in Florida was burned to the ground. The fuse was lit by a white woman (played by Catherine Kellner) who falsely claimed that she was raped by a black stranger -- a story whipped up to explain the bruises inflicted by her extramarital lover. Throw in some trumped-up talk of a race riot by one of the local officials and it's not long before a group of Klansmen are swarming the town in search of a mysterious black war veteran (played by Ving Rhames).

The result is a week-long massacre of torture, shootings and lynchings that Singleton shows in grisly ways on a scale that had never been done before in movies depicting slavery or its legacy. Survivors, many of them children, fled through the nearby swamps. The official death toll was eight, although many believe the final number was much higher. ""'Rosewood' effectively captured the real-life horror of racism,"" said the activist and author Dr. Umar Johnson in an email. ""The lynchings of thousands of African Americans, from the end of slavery in 1865 until the death of Malcolm X in 1965, shows just how inhumane White America can be.""

The film is a powerful reminder that black lives, even entire communities, can be destroyed when someone ""weaponizes [their] whiteness,"" as the cultural critic Roxane Gay recently put it in reference to the news last month of a white woman who called the cops on a black birder in New York's Central Park after he asked her to leash her dog, which is the law. (The call was made on the same day that George Floyd was killed.)

""Selma"" (2014)

Real change in society has often been the result of a political alliance between inside and outside forces. In addition to a citizen-based movement it's necessary to have government operatives or, even better, leaders like Martin Luther King who can stir the people in power to change laws.

As the central figure in ""Selma,"" King (David Oyelowo) is a virtuoso combination of grace, intelligence, rhetorical power and persistence. In an early scene inside the Oval Office, he implores a reluctant President Lyndon Johnson (Tom Wilkinson) to push through the Voting Rights Act of 1965, intended to dismantle barriers that had been put in place to stop some black citizens from voting. Without it, he explains, African Americans would not have the same legal rights, but would continue to be murdered by white people, who would either be protected by white officials or acquitted by all-white juries. ""All white,"" King says, ""because you can't serve on a jury unless you're registered to vote."" Told he'll have to wait, King organizes a massive voting rights demonstration in the South.

The scenes in Ava DuVernay's protest drama are played in a stately, but intimate style. The most powerful images are of the scores of activists marching peacefully through the segregated streets of Alabama. ""Ava's film reminds people that no change has ever happened in America without a movement, and struggle, and that it is never easy,"" said writer-activist Kevin Powell, whose new book of essays, ""When We Free The World,"" is out later this month.

You can feel what it must have been like to be on the front lines -- along with would-be voters (Oprah Winfrey, LaKeith Stanfield) and future Congressman John Lewis (Stephan James) -- standing up to a horde of state troopers brandishing rifles, electric cattle prods and whips.

""Selma"" went on to win an Oscar for best original song (""Glory"" by Common and John Legend) and is the rare studio movie directed by an African American woman.

The film is set around the march on Bloody Sunday in 1965, and the maneuverings and events leading up to it, including the church bombing that killed four little girls in Birmingham, which was a major turning point in the civil rights movement.

""'Selma' is a case study in leadership,"" added Powell. ""It's actually a blessing to have a film to point people to as a teaching tool, to root folks in history, so they understand this is not just for us now, but for those not yet born.""

""Boyz N the Hood"" (1991)

Gang violence was visible on the nightly news and MTV when this searing drama about the challenges black men face while growing up in South Central Los Angeles arrived in 1991.

""Boyz N the Hood"" was by no means the first film to tackle the subject. But it had often been done poorly: for instance, when the story is told from the perspective of the cops -- see ""Colors."" (Better yet, don't!) ""Boyz N the Hood,"" on the other hand, was notable not just for its nuanced, insider's perspective of black life on the margins, but for who was behind the camera. John Singleton was fresh out of USC film school when he became part of a new generation of black filmmakers in Hollywood to find success with mainstream audiences.

In his semi-autobiographical debut, Singleton used the structure of a coming-of-age tale to show what it's like to live in a world where a trip to the corner store could end in a homicide by shotgun. The film earned him two Oscar nominations, for writing and directing, and also introduced several future stars, including Cuba Gooding Jr., Regina King and Ice Cube, who had recently launched a solo rap career after parting with the gangsta rap group N.W.A.

One of the most contemptible characters in ""Boyz N the Hood"" is a black police officer (Jessie Lawrence Ferguson) who responds an hour late to a 9-1-1 call by the main character's father, Furious (Larry Fishburne).

""Homeboy shows up drinking a cup of coffee,"" said director Malcolm Lee, whose movies include ""Undercover Brother"" and the upcoming ""Space Jam: A New Legacy.""

""He feels he's better than hood Negroes because he's in law enforcement, and thinks the world would be better if Furious had killed the intruder,"" Lee said via email. ""He says, 'It'd be one less n**ga out on the streets we'd have to worry about.'""

Years later Furious's college-bound son, Tre (Gooding), is driving home at night when he's stopped by that same officer, who mistakes Tre for a possible gangbanger. Hot-headed and volatile, the cop draws his Smith & Wesson and threatens to blow Tre's head off. We watch as a single tear trickles down Tre's face. In his anguish you can sense the trauma many black people experience after encounters with the police.

""Serpico"" (1973)

Last week former President Barack Obama called on local governments in the U.S. to embrace police accountability and said that, in his view, the ""vast majority"" of police officers are not violent. But the fact is that good cops can sometimes find themselves ostracized if they break rank.

One of the first films to give us a realistic glimpse into life on the force was ""Serpico,"" with Al Pacino in the title role, an incorruptible detective with a fondness for wild disguises. The fact-based thriller not only turned Pacino into a star when it was released in 1973, it also depicted an out-of-control big-city police department where dirty, racist cops work over perps and take bribes from gamblers and drug dealers.

""Hey, Frank, you want a piece of this?"" asks one cop, who's assaulting a black suspect. ""No, I'm going to fill out the police card,"" Serpico replies.

""Serpico"" Credit: IMDB

""'Serpico' is a really powerful depiction of how hard it is to reform policing,"" said Touré, the writer and host of the podcast Touré Show, featuring in-depth interviews with successful black people. ""It shows how much the police will fight against those who demand more from them. The real-life Serpico risked his life to expose wrongdoing.""

At first, Serpico is persuaded, then repeatedly pressured, by fellow officers to ""go along,"" before he blows the whistle on graft and corruption in the department. High-ranking city officials reportedly tried to block the investigation, which blew the lid on the documented "" code of silence ,"" or blue wall, that many precincts are accused of maintaining.

""The police don't want to be policed!"" said Touré, who believes that it is how you end up with three other officers standing by as Derek Chauvin dug his knee into George Floyd's neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds. ""It rips at the core of (the police's) culture.""

""Do The Right Thing"" (1989)

New York's police force also played a critical part in Spike Lee's infernal of race, class and power in 1980s Brooklyn. Dedicated to the families of several black city residents who have died at the hands of police officers, including Michael Stewart (killed in custody in 1983 after graffitiing a subway wall), and Eleanor Bumpurs (shot twice a year later while being evicted from her public housing apartment), this controversial classic established Lee as a major director and unofficial spokesperson for the African American community.

He wrote, starred in and directed ""Do The Right Thing."" The film, which is set up like a play featuring a collage of different voices, tries to show how unchecked racism and xenophobia can fester within a community because of economic inequality and intense social divisions. We get a parade of confrontational scenes between the multi-ethnic cast, which included Danny Aiello, Giancarlo Esposito, Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee and Rosie Perez in her first role, all doing vivid characterizations.

The premise is simple: a slice-of-life film set on one block on the hottest day of the year. The climax is a neighborhood riot, triggered by the killing of a black man by the NYPD. The images of Brooklynites clashing with police and vandalizing a storefront look like they could've been ripped from the current protests. The soundtrack is Public Enemy's ""Fight the Power,"" which plays throughout the film.

On June 1, Lee, who won the Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar in 2019 for his film ""BlacKkKlansman,"" posted a short film on Twitter called ""3 Brothers"" (he debuted it on a CNN special report with Don Lemon), that intercuts cameraphone footage of Eric Garner (a police officer was accused of Garner's death after choking him in 2014 ), and George Floyd, with a scene from ""Do The Right Thing,"" in which Radio Raheem (Bill Nunn) dies in a police chokehold. The short starts with the words, ""Will History Stop Repeating Itself?""

""Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song"" (1971)

""Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song"" Credit: IMDB

Many of the people who have turned out in droves at recent protests have expressed their anger at police violence -- some have themselves clashed with baton-swinging police or have been tear-gassed or hit by rubber bullets -- and they are ready to take action. That's the kind of story Melvin Van Peebles set out to tell in ""Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song,"" a scrappy independent film from 1971 that made a then-impressive $10 million at the box office.

The tough but silent protagonist here is played by Van Peebles, who also served as writer, director, composer and editor. In sharp contrast to previous black stars like Sidney Poitier and Harry Belafonte (whose characters were often neutered), Sweetback is a sexual dynamo with the ladies. For the first ten minutes, the film feels flamboyantly risque. Then Sweetback becomes radicalized -- has a full-on political awakening-- after witnessing two white officers brutalizing an innocent black militant. He intervenes, saving the brother, but kills the cops in the process. At that point the film begins to feel like a Molotav cocktail to white authority.

""Van Peebles' film was groundbreaking for its depiction of Sweetback's blatant sexuality, which poses a threat to the system,"" said film and TV producer Stephanie Allain, a longtime advocate for equity and inclusion in Hollywood, and whose credits include ""Dear White People"" and last year's Oscars telecast.

""But his cop killing separates him from society and puts him on the run, probably forever. To me, it's a statement that black male strength is frightening to 'the man.' And it still is.""

""Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song"" was the first movie to reflect the politics of the Black Arts Movement, one tenet of which is for black people to promote empowering images of themselves in the media. And with its funk-soul soundtrack and shots of the black community aiding Sweetback, as he runs for his freedom, the film also seemed to hint at a grassroots revolution in cinema. It was, and it wasn't.

While Van Peebles did introduce a defiant new hero who triumphed over a brutal white power structure, paving the way for the blaxploitation era of the 1970s (which at its unprecedented peak saw more than 40 black-themed movies produced over a two-year span), few films since have matched its cultural resonance.

""Queen & Slim"" (2019)

If Sweetback had any offspring they would be ""Queen & Slim."" The title characters in this intriguing drama from 2019 start out at an Ohio diner, where they are on an awkward first date. She (Jodie Turner-Smith) is a black defense attorney; he (Daniel Kaluuya) works at Costco. While heading home their car is arbitrarily pulled over by a racist police officer. A scuffle ensues and they shoot and kill him in self-defense. Shell shocked, they flee the scene.

The comparisons to ""Bonnie and Clyde"" are unavoidable. (""Well, if it isn't the black Bonnie and Clyde,"" says one of the characters.) Like that classic about the real-life, white, Depression-era bank robbers, ""Queen & Slim"" has outlaws who fall in love while eluding the authorities and become accidental folk heroes, in this case, because of a viral video of the officer's dashcam footage.

But whereas the thrill-seeking and sex-starved antiheroes in ""Bonnie and Clyde"" were excited to see their pictures in the paper, Queen and Slim are just the opposite. They are on the lam because of the same police abuse and systemic injustice that have ignited the current protests.

By making a terrifying menace out of what is assumed to be a protective force -- the police -- the filmmakers have created an audacious, lyrical film that should be required viewing for anyone who wants to understand the grief and rage of the Black Lives Matter generation.

""Queen & Slim"" was the work of director Melina Matsoukas, a young woman of color on the rise whose stylistic music videos for Beyoncé have mixed documentary and fantasy elements, and ""The Chi"" TV series creator and LGBTQ activist Lena Waithe, who called her original script ""protest art.""

The filmmakers said the goal with ""Queen & Slim"" was to realistically portray what it means to be African American today, where you feel the need to regularly contemplate your own mortality, in hopes that you don't become the next hashtag, while following your own path to happiness. One criticism of the movie, however, is that it might be a little too real, or not optimistic enough anyway.

""'Queen & Slim' was very powerful and effectively communicated the psychological and emotional conflicts that exist within the black community toward the police,"" Dr. Umar Johnson said. ""On another level, I feel that the movie did a disservice to the black liberation struggle by not allowing the two protagonists to escape. It reinforced the idea that we can never successfully revolt against the white police power structure.""

That may be what the film says, but then, new scripts are being written every day.",2020-07-14,https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/african-american-movies-white-authority-protests/index.html
Monica Sarkar,Why does Bollywood use the offensive practice of brownface in movies?,"Monica Sarkar , CNN Written by

Bollywood may be best known for its glamorous casts, glitzy costumes and energetic dance routines. But it also has a far less flattering reputation -- for promoting the offensive practice of brownface.

""It's actually racism,"" said award-winning film director Neeraj Ghaywan. ""Let's not mince our words.""

In the United States, the concepts of blackface and brownface date back to the 19th century , when white performers would darken their faces with makeup, and use racist stereotypes to portray black and other ethnic minority characters. White performers did this in a time when non-white professionals were themselves barred from employment in the industry.

And the practice dates back even further in England, to the Elizabethan era, when directors traditionally cast white actors to play minority characters in Shakespearean plays. Even into recent decades, the African general in ""Othello"" has long been played by a white actor with darkened skin, including Orson Welles in 1951 and Laurence Olivier in 1965.

It's also appeared in modern films. Dan Aykroyd wore blackface and dreadlocks in 1983's ""Trading Places,"" and Robert Downey Jr. appeared several shades darker in 2008's ""Tropic Thunder,"" to play a white Australian method actor who darkened his skin to play a black man in a Vietnam war film.

Bollywood has adopted brownface in a number of films -- by temporarily darkening the skin of performers, especially when they are portraying characters from disadvantaged backgrounds.

As in the early days of Hollywood, critics of this practice say that Bollywood often prefers this approach to actually hiring performers who have naturally darker skin, thus perpetuating discrimination and inequality in the industry.

For example, the popular 2019 film ""Bala"" featured the story of a woman who suffered discrimination on the basis of her skin tone.

The woman was played by famed actress Bhumi Pednekar (pictured above), who had her skin darkened in order to play the role. The move was slammed by some Indian media outlets, commentators and on social media.

Some pointed out the irony of one of the film's promotional posters tweeted by Pednekar, where her character was ""surrounded by skin lightening products (and) is actually lightskinned and in brownface.""

Pednekar defended the director's decision to cast her in the movie, according to Indian media reports, saying factors apart from physical appearance play a major role: ""If a filmmaker has taken me, it is because I add some value to the film."" ​

The director, Amar Kaushik, told the Press Trust of India he ""thought about casting a dark-skinned actor,"" but ""felt Bhumi was superb for this character.""

CNN reached out to Pednekar via her agent and Kaushik for comment, but both ​declined to comment.

The popularity of films that use brownface, such as box office hits ""Super 30"" and ""Gully Boy,"" also released in 2019, suggest that Bollywood ​is yet to come under significant public pressure for a practice that many people consider racist and offensive.

'Glamour behind the mask'

India's attitude towards fairness is an ancient concept.

""It predates colonialism and is certainly linked to caste,"" said sociologist Sanjay Srivastava, who works at the Institute of Economic Growth in Delhi.

""Hindu religious texts are full of what we would now recognize as racial stereotypes: lower caste figures as dark and ugly... To be dark is to be a manual laborer, working in the sun. Fair skin is also a mark of class.""

The arrival of pale-skinned British colonial leaders in the 18th century also had a role to play, deepening the prejudice, he said.

""During the colonial era, race and racism functioned in the context of the so-called mixed-race populations, the Anglo-Indians. The 'closer' you were to a white progenitor, the higher up in the hierarchy of race."" British rule is also blamed for further polarizing the castes.

Fairness, on the other hand, is revered and considered a sign of beauty and status. ""Bollywood, and Indian cinema generally, had two remarkable antecedents: religious iconography and Parsi theater,"" said Vijay Mishra, a Professor of English Literature at Australia's Murdoch University and the author of ""Bollywood cinema: Temples of desire.""

""For both, 'whiteness' was essential,"" Mishra said.

Hindu gods and goddesses are ""remarkably white,"" except for dark-skinned Shiva, Rama and Krishna, he said. In Parsi theater, ""Parsis, through their Iranian ethnicity, are extremely fair.""

India's independence in 1947 paved the way for a new constitution that outlawed caste-based discrimination, but it is still prevalent in parts of India. In its 2019 World Report , Human Rights Watch noted that Dalits, formerly referred to as ""untouchables,"" ""continued to be discriminated against in education and in jobs.""

And colorism, discrimination based on the color of someone's skin, is prevalent in Bollywood, Srivastava argued. ​

""Colorism is not problematized at all, since a vast number of Bollywood cinema relies upon prejudice as a vehicle for entertainment.

""It would be considered perfectly natural that they would don brownface to portray a dark character... (because audiences) also like to be assured that the glamour is still there, behind the mask.""

CNN reached out to Yash Raj Films that handles ""Gully Boy"" actor Ranveer Singh's publicity for comment, but they declined.

""Super 30"" actor Hrithik Roshan's representatives did not respond to CNN's request for comment.

The decision to choose a fair-skinned, famous actor over a dark-skinned performer is based on the desire to make a big budget movie ""financially viable,"" said film director ​Neeraj Ghaywan, who has worked on Bollywood and independent films. ""That is how people think in Bollywood.""

As a member of the Scheduled (or Dalit) Caste, the lowest rung on India's societal ladder, Ghaywan is a rare exception in an industry dominated by higher castes.

He tweeted a callout last year for assistant writers and directors from lower castes to contact him for work.

Ghaywan believes Bollywood's lack of diversity may be partly why caste is misrepresented.

People from the Scheduled Caste make up 16.6% of the Indian population, according to 2011 census figures. But in 2014, analysis by The Hindu newspaper found that only two Bollywood movies made that year had featured a lower caste character in a leading role.

However, Ghaywan argued that the root of the problem is that caste discrimination is deeply entrenched in India and that Bollywood is merely reflecting society's ideals.

""They have been so internalized through our cinema itself,"" he said, referring to an early example of the 1957 Indian epic ""Mother India,"" where actor Sunil Dutt's skin was darkened to play the role of a farmer.

""We internalize it so much that it is part of a muscle memory, and we don't even think about it.""

Bollywood's endorsement of fairness products

But ​like discrimination on the basis of caste, discrimination on the basis of skin color is not confined to the big, Bollywood screen.

Seema Hari was born and raised in Mumbai. She said she was bullied at school for being dark-skinned and even taunted on the street by passersby who would tell her that she was bringing bad luck by showing her face in public.

""I did not know a reality where I was not depressed or suicidal in my childhood,"" said Hari who is now a Snapchat software engineer and model based in Los Angeles.

She also campaigns against colorism, which she said is evident not only in Bollywood but on the shelves of Indian pharmacies and supermarkets that stock skin-lightening products.

Advocates say some of the best-known Bollywood stars are perpetuating the preference for lighter skin by lending their names and faces to the industry's advertising campaigns promoting ""fairness"" creams.

""Some of the ads... were so blatantly racist... If you put a Bollywood star in it, it becomes normal; it becomes what people accept,"" said Hari.

Society's preference for lighter skin has led to a booming global business in skin lightening products. The international market for skin whitening cosmetics is predicted to reach more than $6.5 billion by 2025, according to a report by Global Industry Analysts.

While a handful of Indian celebrities have refused to be associated with skin lightening products, some big names have allowed their faces to be used to promote them in India. ​

Often dubbed the ""King of Bollywood,"" actor Shah Rukh Khan ​endorsed ""Fair and Handsome,"" a fairness cream for men, ​for years.

In 2013, a petition calling for an end to the product's discriminatory advertising garnered more than 27,000 signatories. In 2016, Khan reportedly told The Guardian that he would never use the product himself, although it is unclear whether his sponsorship remains active. His agent did not respond to CNN's request for comment.

Khan isn't the only celebrity who has modeled ​for skin lightening products. For example, actor John Abraham currently endorses the Garnier Men PowerLight fairness moisturizer. ""John endorses (the) entire Garnier men's skin care and hair range and the communication is skin and hair care,"" his manager, Minnakshi Das ​said.

In 2014, the Advertising Standard Council of India (ASCI) issued guidelines on the promotion of fairness products, stating that they cannot show dark-skinned people as depressed or disadvantaged.

While the independent body said they saw a ""substantial shift"" in discriminatory advertising, Bollywood stars continued to appear in promotions.

In February, the Indian ministry of health and family welfare proposed a draft bill that would ban advert​isements that promote fairness creams, among other items. Law breakers could face a five-year jail term or ​a Rs 50 lakh fine (about $70,000).

""Celebrity endorsements are a huge part of the advertising industry,"" said Shweta Purandare, secretary general of the ASCI.

""It commands about 24% of India's total advertising expenditure... With new regulations... we expect to see celebrities being more cautious."" However, it is not clear from the bill whether celebrities themselves would be punished.

'They just want to be white'

But skin lightening is not limited to over-the-counter creams.

""We have a few patients who aspire to be in Bollywood (and) who are too much into skin lightening treatments,"" said dermatologist Dr. Sujata Chandrappa, who runs a beauty clinic in the southern city of Bangalore.

Clients ask her how certain dark-skinned stars became so fair-skinned. ""This is deep rooted in the Indian psyche, that fairness is the prerequisite factor to enter into the Bollywood industry.""

She told CNN that she tries to talk some people out of the treatments, only offering the skin lightening procedure if a client has skin issues such as melasma, hyperpigmentation, sun damage or age spots. If a client insists on help to make themselves fairer in the absence of any other skin problems, she refuses to carry out the treatment.

""I get this feeling that I'm encouraging racism, which is not acceptable. But they just want to be white."" ​

However, conversations on colorism are starting to change.

Ten years ago, Indian NGO ""Women of Worth"" founded the ""Dark is Beautiful"" campaign that runs workshops in schools, colleges, workplaces and communities across the country to dismantle prejudiced attitudes towards dark skin.

They also initiated the petition against Shah Rukh Khan's endorsement of the ""Fair and Handsome"" cream.

Nandita Das, actress and spokeswoman of the ""Dark is Beautiful"" movement, said the campaign has encouraged victims of colorism to share their stories, exposing the extent of India's obsession with fairness.

""Suddenly, it was out in the open, something that had been there for so long in our matrimonial ads, cosmetics and products that we see all around,"" Das told CNN. ""We wonder why we haven't talked about it much earlier.""

Das, who also screen-writes and directs, believes ""we have a long way to go"" before this billion-dollar industry casts a dark-skinned performer in a leading role.

She said her skin tone would make her ""perfect"" for a lower caste or class role. But when she plays ""an educated or upper middle-class character, often the director, cinematographer, or makeup person tell you: 'don't worry, we'll lighten your skin.'""

Das believes Bollywood directors have the freedom to cast whom they please, but she advises thinking ""deeper into that prejudice.""

Some experts argue that Bollywood's influence on society is bigger than ever, partly because of social media.

On-screen stars ""used to be legends whom nobody saw"" in real life, said film critic Subhash Jha. ""(But) they've started to become very close to their fans, so the impact is larger."" The biggest Bollywood stars have tens of millions of followers on Instagram and TikTok, the video-sharing social networking service.

Hari believes that Bollywood celebrities could be doing much more to change attitudes across the country to dark skin. Imagine ""Shah Rukh Khan walking away from a (fairness product) advertisement,"" she said. ""That itself will change so many minds.""

But does the industry's persistent perpetuation of colorism suggest that it is racist?

""Deeply, fundamentally, irrevocably,"" said Srivastava. ""There are no standards of beauty linked to dark skin... There is no vocabulary within Bollywood to discuss race at all because in broader society, no such vocabulary or context has been allowed to develop.""

When it comes to using brownface in movies, ""they don't even think there's a problem,"" said film director Ghaywan. ""That's the biggest problem.""

Marianna Cerini,From rainbow to gray: The evolution of hair dye,"Written by Marianna Cerini, CNN

CNN Style has launched a dedicated Beauty section. Read more Beauty stories here

For centuries, hair dye has been pivotal in helping people portray a certain image -- to either fit in with the beauty standards of the day or to dramatically subvert them.

Women in particular have long tried to conform with the notion that female beauty comes with a glossy mane -- from blonde to black to dusted with gold or flour, depending on the time and place.

""Throughout history, the status of our hair has served as an instant visual cue for value judgment,"" said Caterina Gentili, PhD candidate at the Centre for Appearance Research in England, in a phone interview. ""One of the many ways for society to objectify female bodies, and deem them worthy, or not, of attention.""

In recent decades, Gentili said ""hair color products have become a key tool for women to stay visible, and shield them from one of the biggest stigmas placed on them: aging.""

By 2025, the global hair color market is expected to be worth around $28 billion , up more than 8% on its estimated value of $17.8 billion in 2019, indicating continuing strong demand for hair-altering products.

However, the figures don't show a small, growing trend among women to embrace their natural locks -- grays included -- as a statement against traditional gender expectations.

Now, dying your hair is not solely about covering up imperfections; it's about upending ideals, making a bold statement and reclaiming your natural hue.

From leeches and sulfuric acid to synthetic dyes

In its early iterations, hair coloring was done by both men and women to enhance their looks or hide white strands, according to Victoria Sherrow's ""Encyclopedia of Hair: A Cultural History.""

Ancient civilizations used rudimentary hair colorants, based on recipes that included cassia bark, leeks, leeches, charred eggs, henna -- still commonly used across the Middle East and India -- and even gold dust.

Ancient Greeks favored gold and red-gold shades, associated with Aphrodite, the goddess of love, health and youthfulness. Likewise, high-class Greek and Roman prostitutes opted for blonde hues to suggest sensuality.

It wasn't until the Middle Ages in Europe that hair dyeing began shifting into a predominantly female habit.

Bleaches, often made with blended flowers, saffron and calf kidneys, were particularly in vogue, although Roman Catholics associated blond hair with lasciviousness.

Red dyes, often a mix of saffron and sulfur powder -- the latter of which could induce nosebleeds and headaches, was popularized during the 16th-century reign of Elizabeth I of England.

The hue was a favorite in Italian courts as well, thanks to Renaissance artist Titian, who painted female beauties with red-gold locks. In the 18th century, European elites favored perfumed white and pastel powders made from wheat flour dusted lightly onto natural hair and wigs.

While most hair dyes were composed of plants and animal products, the evolution of the practice also saw the use of dangerous, even lethal methods to change hair color: lead combs to darken it, or sulfuric acid to lighten it.

It wasn't until the early 20th century that hair dye as we know it -- chemical, in a rainbow of colors, shop-bought or salon-applied -- came to be.

In 1907, a young French chemist named Eugene Schueller used para-phenylenediamine (PPD), a chemical discovered in the previous century, for the world's first synthetic dye, which he called ""Oréal.""

Two years later, Schueller founded his business, the French Harmless Hair Dye Company -- a name meant to alleviate people's fears of using manufactured hair color. In 1909, he decided to change it to something a little snappier: L'Oréal.

The aging card

For the first decades of the 20th century, women were fearful of commercial dye formulants. Chemical hair color was considered unsafe, and the practice itself had an image problem: as in the modest Victorian era, it was seen as something vain women, not respectable housewives, would do.

In the 1940s, even as the beauty trend became more popular, salons offered back entrances for clients who didn't want to make their dye habits known.

To expand their market, some beauty companies decided to tap into the anxiety around aging and sell color as a way to cover up gray hair. A black-and-white French L'Oréal ad from the 1920s depicted a sad-looking woman next to a smiling version of herself in a black bob; the English translation reads: ""Not one more white hair; forever 30 years old.""

A Clairol print campaign from 1943, ""Gray Hair -- The Heartless Dictator,"" declared: ""Without justice or kindness, gray hair can rule your life... It can dictate many things you say or do. No wonder other women refuse to tolerate this tyrant.""

Pressuring women to maintain their hair color as they aged ""was the marketing ploy that made hair dye as ubiquitous as using soap,"" said Claire Robinson, author of the essay ""Grey is a Feminist Issue.

""While the ideal had been perpetuated for generations, the modern beauty industry pushed it in a more aggressive way, playing on insecurities (and) self-doubt.""

Advertising companies also worked on normalizing dyes by selling them on their subtlety, such as the iconic 1956 Clairol ad ""Does she...or doesn't she?,"" which was so popular that copywriter Shirley Polykoff's slogan became a catchphrase in the States. Around that time, the debut of home-color kits also ensured privacy, paving the way for the widespread use of hair dye.

While in the 1950s only 4-7% of American women dyed their hair, by the 1970s, the figure had risen to some 40%. By 2015, an estimated 70% of American women were using it. A 2019 OnePoll survey for haircare brand Living Proof showed similarly high figures in the UK.

In South and East Asia, the picture is similar. In India, where the hair care industry is a $3.3 billion business, colorants account for 18% of the overall hair category and have been growing 15% a year, according to a report by Nielsen . Indian women are particularly fond of Garnier Black Naturals , owned by L'Oréal, currently its highest selling hair dye brand globally.

Sales of hair colorants in the Middle East and Africa registered at $201.88 million in 2017, an increase of almost 10% over 2016, with bleachers as the market's fastest growing segment.

China and South Korea have all seen a huge increase in demand for hair color products, mostly darker dyes, both for men and women. In Japan, the beauty ideal attached to black hair is so strong that some schools force students to dye their hair black, though in recent years the rule has provoked backlash.

But dyeing is no longer just about natural looks. Dip dyes and rainbow hues spanning pink, turquoise and violet have become fashionable for young women across the world and, to an extent, men (such as celebrities Jared Leto and Zayn Malik). Bright shades also began appearing on armpit hair, notably by Miley Cyrus.

Roxie Jane Hunt, a Seattle-based hair stylist who specializes in rainbow dyes, sees this new approach as a way ""to demonstrate personal choice and play around with identity,"" she said over the phone. ""A lot of women feel like they want to stand out, not blend in.""

In Asia, South Koreans especially embraced rainbow dyes, from coral to ash to cherry pink. Chameleon-like hair changes even became a signature look for a number of K-pop stars -- so much so that a new hair color is often seen as signifier of a change in those artists' careers, be it a new album, single, or tour.

Over the last couple of years, a growing number of Asian women have also been going blond or full platinum -- a way for some to feel like a stronger version of themselves

Gray is the new blond

Gray has also become popular -- entering salons and home kits as a ""hot"" new dye.

Shades of silver, steel or platinum white -- for which social media coined the hashtag #grannyhair -- were touted by celebrities including Kim Kardashian and Ariana Grande.

Suddenly, gray tones were cool -- albeit, one might argue, only on women under 40, and when achieved via costly colorants and treatments.

While gray coloring might trend on Instagram, natural gray hair still has a complicated reputation for women around the world -- and in China, men.

""Gray has been made out to be something to be avoided at all costs in the name of self-respect,"" Robinson noted.

For the handful of famous women who have embraced it -- Judi Dench, Helen Mirren, Jamie Lee Curtis, Theresa May, Christine Lagarde -- there's a much larger segment of the entertainment, cultural and political worlds that have not.

""The lack of white-haired role models or naturally graying young stylish icons isn't at all surprising,"" Gentili said. ""For a long time, and still today, a woman with gray hair would conjure up images of a grandmother: wise and nurturing, but completely desexualized. Salt-and-pepper men on the other hand -- even that expression is so different! -- are seen as distinguished, charismatic, confident, experienced, sexy.""

For a lot of women, the double standard feels ever-so stifling. Since Truslow Smith launched "" Grombre"" -- a play on gray and ombre -- in 2016, the Instagram account has garnered more than 174,000 followers, with dozens of women submitting photos of their gray heads daily. Truslow Smith, who found her first gray hair at 14 and decided to stop dyeing at 24, said it has encouraged positive conversations around the topic, but also served as a form of validation.

""Embracing natural gray hair truly is a lifestyle shift, not just a trend,"" she said. Most people who do it don't usually return to dyeing. It's a liberating decision.""

She notices how young some of the posters are, and hopes the term ""premature graying,"" which describes people in their 20s and 30s, can be re-evaluated.

""Is it truly 'premature graying,' or has hair dye been established as such a standard that we don't know what natural looks like at certain ages?""

Be it gray or lime green, embracing a color change outside of the established canon is, for many, a leap of faith.

""It's a form of self-expression,"" Hunt said.

All the more if you're asserting yourself as a woman who is not afraid of aging.

""It takes courage,"" Gentili said. ""It's a choice far more rebellious than any pink dye will ever be.""

Joshua Berlinger,How did Kim Jong Un get his Mercedes-Benzes? New report traces origin of North Korea's luxury rides,"Joshua Berlinger , CNN Written by

On June 14, 2018, two armored Mercedes-Maybach S600 Guard vehicles were shipped from the Dutch Port of Rotterdam, heading out on a journey that would take months and see the cars transported thousands of miles through six countries, according to a new report from the Washington-based Center for Advanced Defense Studies (C4ADS).

After stops in China, Japan, South Korea and Russia, the two cars -- each worth about $500,000 -- are believed to have been flown to their final destination, Pyongyang. And in the North Korean capital, there's only one customer who likely requires this type of ride.

The origin and journey of the two Mercedes luxury vehicles were exposed in the C4ADS report. CNN has not independently verified C4ADS' reporting.

Sanctions passed by the United Nations as punishment for Pyongyang's nuclear weapons development are supposed to bar companies and individuals from selling luxury goods to North Korea.

C4ADS found that North Korea imported at least $191 million worth of luxury goods from 2015 to 2017, sourced from ""as many as 90 countries"" in violation of United Nations sanctions. Definitive figures are difficult to determine because there isn't a shared definition of what constitutes a ""luxury item"" and due to the surreptitious way North Korea imports such items.

The Mercedes-Maybach S600, however, is undoubtedly luxurious. It's equipped with leather massaging seats and armor to protect occupants from steel-core ammo fired from assault rifles and from explosive devices, according to Car and Driver.

Kim is usually seen being chauffeured in what's believed to be a Mercedes-Maybach Pullman Guard armored limousine, which carries a price tag upwards of $1 million. It's believed that was the vehicle his security escort ran alongside of during his first summit with South Korean President Moon Jae-in last year.

Kim was also spotted with a Rolls-Royce last year

Daimler, the company that owns Mercedes, told CNN it ""has no indication on how the mentioned vehicles were delivered and where they come from.""

""Our company has had no business connections with North Korea for far more than 15 years now and strictly complies with EU and US embargoes. To prevent deliveries to North Korea and to any of its embassies worldwide, Daimler has implemented a comprehensive export control process, which we consider appropriate and effective and which meets all requirements of the export control authorities,"" the company said in a statement to CNN.

""Sales of vehicles by third parties, especially of used vehicles, are beyond our control and responsibility. We always investigate the vehicles displayed on the photos in the media thoroughly. However, without the vehicle identification numbers it is impossible to find a concrete trace.""

C4ADS concluded that North Korea maintains a complex, constantly evolving series of schemes in order to obtain luxury goods, like Kim's cars, to get around global export controls. The report concluded Pyongyang has imported 803 luxury vehicles from 2015 to 2017, with the majority originating from Russian companies.

""Not only are they continuing to use techniques that have been successful in disrupting traditional enforcement, but they're also sort of watching how we're tracking them and developing much more sophisticated techniques to continue to evade sanctions,"" said Jason Arterburn, a co-author of the C4ADS paper.

Lucas Kuo, another one of the report's co-authors, told CNN C4ADS' investigation aimed to ""evaluate what were the deficiencies within the international system that allowed this activity to continue?""

Eight months of investigating

Kuo said it took himself and the report's co-authors eight months of investigating how Kim was able allegedly to obtain the Benzes. They scoured customs records, shipping data, bills of lading and other open-source documents to trace how the vehicles made their way from Rotterdam to Pyongyang.

""We think we built a pretty compelling case to say that these Mercedes were likely bound for North Korea,"" he said.

CNN has not independently verified C4ADS' reporting.

Kuo and his co-authors concluded that the two Mercedes left Rotterdam for Dalian, then made their way on to Osaka, Japan, and Busan, South Korea. From South Korea, they were shipped out on a vessel called the DN5505, per the bill of lading.

That's when the journey gets murky. Shortly after the DN5505 left South Korea, it reported via its AIS system -- a way to locate ships at sea -- that its intended destination was the Russian city of Nakhodka, where it was estimated to arrive on October 5, according to C4ADS.

However, the ship's AIS data stopped pinging locations from October 1 to 19, according to the report. Though AIS transponders do not ping when ships are far at sea, they could have been turned off -- a common tactic used by ships breaking sanctions law, experts say.

When the DN5505's transponder turned back on, the ship was spotted near where it originally disappeared, according to C4ADS, but this time heading in the opposite direction back to Busan. On November 2, the vessel submitted a bill of lading to South Korean customs authorities that showed the ship was transporting anthracite coal allegedly from Nakhodka. But in Nakhodka, ""no record exists"" of the DN5505's arrival, C4ADS said.

CNN has reached out to the Port of Nakhodka authorities for comment on the report.

Back in Russia, on October 7 -- two days after the estimated arrival time of the DN5505 -- three Ilyushin-76 cargo jets operated by North Korea's state-run airline reportedly traveled from Pyongyang to Vladivostok. Those jets are often used to transport armored vehicles used by North Korea's elites, and are rarely spotted in in Vladivostok, C4ADS said.

""When asked for comment, the North Korean consulate in Vladivostok reportedly did not provide an explanation for the unscheduled flights on October 7,"" C4ADS said in its report.

""We have not uncovered direct evidence that the overlapping visits of the cargo jets and the DN5505 to the Russian Far East are related. However, given the heavy lift cargo capacity of the planes and their role in transporting Kim Jong Un's armored limousines, it is possible that the cargo jets could have loaded the Mercedes,"" the C4ADS report said.

Dual use

While cracking down on luxury goods may not hurt North Korea as much as going after its valuable coal exports, identifying those who allegedly helped Kim get his cars could close off some loopholes, said George Lopez, a former member of the UN Panel of Experts on North Korea, which is charged with monitoring sanctions enforcement and efficacy.

C4ADS also claims that understanding how North Korea smuggles luxury goods could provide useful information to law enforcement attempting to stop Pyongyang's from obtaining more dangerous items with military or nuclear applications.

""North Korea acquires high-end luxury goods through the same overseas smuggling networks as other contraband. As a result, their detection and seizure could be a means to drive action against the Kim regime's core procurement operations,"" the report found.

""High-end luxury goods share key features with dual-use goods for North Korea's weapons program: they are scarce, specialized products with high monetary value and great symbolic importance for the Kim regime.""

Jacopo Prisco,Ryugyong Hotel: The story of North Korea's 'Hotel of Doom',"Jacopo Prisco , CNN Written by

In 1987, ground was broken on a grand new hotel in North Korea's capital, Pyongyang. The pyramid-shaped, supertall skyscraper was to exceed 1,000 feet in height, and was designed to house at least 3,000 rooms, as well as five revolving restaurants with panoramic views.

The Ryugyong Hotel -- named after a historical moniker for Pyongyang meaning ""capital of willows"" -- was supposed to open just two years later. But it never did.

While the structure reached its planned height in 1992, it stood windowless and hollow for another 16 years, its naked concrete exposed, like a menacing monster overlooking the city. During that time the building, which dwarfs everything around it, earned itself the nickname ""Hotel of Doom.""

The hotel has since been clad in metal and glass, and was later fitted with LED lights to turn it into a colorful nighttime spectacle. Construction work has started and stopped many times, fueling constant speculation over whether it will ever open to guests.

Still closed to this day, the Ryugyong Hotel is the world's tallest unoccupied building.

A Cold War pawn

The Ryugyong Hotel was a product of the Cold War rivalry between US-supported South Korea and the Soviet-backed North. The year before construction commenced, a South Korean firm had built what was then the world's tallest hotel, the Westin Stamford in Singapore. The South's capital Seoul was meanwhile getting ready to host the 1988 Summer Olympics, with the country transitioning to a capitalist democracy.

As part of North Korea's political response to the South's achievements, Pyongyang organized the 1989 World Festival of Youth and Students, a sort of socialist version of the Olympics. The country planned to build the massive hotel just in time for the event, stealing the world record away from the South.

But due to engineering problems it wasn't finished in time for the festival. The government had already poured billions into the event, building a new stadium, expanding Pyongyang's airport and paving new roads. That put a strain on the hermit state's frail economy, while the Soviet Union's collapse left it deprived of vital aid and investment.

North Korea was bound for an economic crisis. Although the external structure had been completed, construction was halted in 1992 and a crane was abandoned on top of the building.

A concrete structure

The building consists of three wings, each sloped at a 75-degree angle, converging into a cone encasing the top 15 floors, which are intended for restaurants and observation decks.

The pyramidal shape is about more than aesthetics -- it's because the Ryugyong, unusually for a skyscraper, is made of reinforced concrete rather than steel.

""It was built like this because the upper levels needed to be lighter,"" said Calvin Chua, a Singapore-based architect who has extensively researched Pyongyang's urbanism, in a phone interview. ""They didn't have advanced construction materials, so it was built entirely in concrete. You can't achieve a slender tower that way, you need to have a massive base with a tapered top.

""If you look at the history of construction in North Korea since the end of the Korean War, most of the buildings are made of concrete: That's the material that they are familiar with, and the technology transfer between Soviet or communist states is purely based around concrete.""

According to Chua, who has worked in North Korea with local architects, the Ryugyong may have been designed to look like a mountain, not a pyramid, because mountains play an important role in the country's symbolism. The official biography of Kim Jong Il, the deceased father of current ruler Kim Jong Un, states that he was born in a secret military camp on Mount Paektu, the tallest mountain in the Korean peninsula that is depicted in the national emblem of North Korea. (Many historians believe Kim Jong Il was actually born in Russia.)

""It's a very iconic building, but I think it's important to consider where it sits in relation to the entire city fabric of Pyongyang,"" said Chua. ""It's like a sort of obelisk. If you think of the obelisk in Rome's St. Peter's Square, it provides a [beacon] for the city apart from its symbolism. The Ryugyong is similar, but it's also more symbolically defined.""

A second start

In 2008, after a 16-year pause, construction unexpectedly resumed, as part of a deal with Orascom, an Egyptian conglomerate that was contracted to build North Korea's 3G network.

The rusty old crane that had stood atop the building for two decades was finally removed . Workers aided by Egyptian engineers installed glass and metal panels to the concrete structure at the cost of $180 million, glazing it completely and giving the building a polished, sleek appearance. The project, completed in 2011, fueled speculation about the hotel's opening. In late 2012, German luxury hotel group Kempinski announced that the Ryugyong would partially open under its management in mid-2013, but then pulled out a few months later, stating that entering the market was ""not currently possible.""

Long-standing rumors that the building was structurally unsound due to poor construction techniques and materials gained strength once again. In 2014, a 23-story apartment building collapsed in Pyongyang because construction was ""not done properly,"" according to North Korean state media reports.

""Judging from the exterior, the building looks structurally sound, although the interior may be a different story,"" said Chua. ""I think the real problem might be the ease of fitting it out, because it was built with concrete and it would take a lot of time to rewire the necessary services and ventilation systems that were originally created to 1980s specifications. That would be much easier with a steel structure.""

Photographs of the hotel's interior from 2012 revealed that, inside, very little work had been done. The images were taken by Simon Cockerell, general manager at Koryo Group, a Beijing-based company specializing in North Korea tours, and one of the very few foreigners to have been inside the Ryugyong Hotel.

""It was arranged through a Korean connection as a birthday gift for me,"" he said in a phone interview. ""First of all, we had a presentation from the director of the site, with videos made quite a long time ago. Then they took us into the lobby area, where there was a lot of exposed cement. Then we went (on) the one working elevator to the top, which was the 99th floor, I believe.

""It took a long time to get there, because it was a service elevator, not a modern lift with a string of buttons. There was a lift operator who determined where to stop. At the top we had a look around, took some pictures and went back down to the lobby again.""

Although its external appearance had been transformed, the Ryugyong still wasn't open.

A brighter future?

The Ryugyong came back to life in 2018, when LEDs were installed on its facade, turning the building into Pyonyang's biggest light show -- as well as a propaganda machine. A four-minute program shows North Korea's history and a variety of political slogans, while the cone at the top projects a huge North Korean flag.

""It's really striking the first time you see it, especially after so many years of the building sitting there in darkness,"" said Will Ripley, a CNN correspondent who has taken multiple trips to Pyongyang, in an email. ""I know they turn it on whenever there are major events in the city, but it's not on all the time -- I would assume to save scarce electricity.""

In recent years, extensive work has been carried out on the site surrounding the hotel, which was recently opened up, making it possible for anyone to walk right up to the front entrance (but not get in). In June 2018, a sign was added to the building, reading simply ""The Ryugyong Hotel"" in Korean and English.

The question remains: Will it ever open? ""It's very hard to say, because since the building was clad in glass, you can't see inside,"" said Cockerell. ""No doubt something's going on. It's a very large building. It's not inconceivable that some part of it may open before the whole of it could open. If it was my building, I'd focus on the top and the bottom.""

The Ryugyong Hotel is no longer the tallest building in the Korean peninsula: The Lotte World Tower in Seoul, completed in 2017, surpassed it by nearly 800 feet (240 meters). It is still the tallest in North Korea, although Pyongyang has seen a growth spurt of high-rise residential towers recently, with the tallest being just 197 feet (60 meters) shorter than the Ryugyong.

For years, to avoid embarrassment, the North Korean government has airbrushed the building from official pictures of Pyongyang. But the installation of the LED lighting may signal that there's a plan for its future.

""I think the North Korean government would definitely like to do something with it,"" said Ripley. ""For years, it was an embarrassing eyesore -- especially before the glass exterior was installed. I imagine if they do finish it, and Kim Jong Un makes an inspection and it's all over the state media, it will be more widely acknowledged as a proud centerpiece of the city.

""Personally, I think it would be fascinating to see what they do with the inside and go all the way to the top. I'm sure the views are extraordinary.""",2020-07-14,https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/ryugyong-hotel-architecture-origins/index.html

His bid was in dollars, and the lot in question was the last known Leonardo da Vinci painting in private hands. Audible gasps gave way to applause, and, less than a minute later, the gavel fell to make history.

After fees, the ""Salvator Mundi"" sold for $450.3 million , obliterating auction records for a work of art.

But it wasn't Rotter who made the world-famous purchase -- it was the anonymous bidder on the end of his telephone line. In fact, he was just as surprised as anyone.

""I thought when we reached $200 million it would end,"" he recalled to CNN on the phone. ""Then I thought it would end when we reached $300 million... a natural stopping point.""

""It was really unclear how far the client would go. It was just (me saying), 'Do you want to?' I remember making sure that I -- that he -- was very clear about the bidding increments and what the next bid was.

""Normally I'd just say the next bid, but I remember clarifying it at 300 million. I said, 'It's $300 million, do you want to bid $300 million now?'

""At this level you can't mess up -- you can't (get it) wrong,"" he added.

It's a remarkably candid account, given how tight-lipped Christie's has remained about the historic sale. The auction house has consistently refused to discuss the bidder's identity, though it is widely believed to have been Saudi Prince Badr bin Abdullah bin Mohammed bin Farhan Al Saud, acting on behalf of the kingdom's Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, better known as MbS.

The moment Leonardo da Vinci's ""Salvator Mundi"" sold for $450 million.

""I had no recollection of time -- you could have told me it was two minutes,"" Rotter said of the 18-minute bidding war, adding: ""(It) was one of the most exciting moments that I've experienced in my 20 years of auctions.""

Art world matchmaker

Austrian-born Rotter, Christie's chairman of post-war and contemporary art, wouldn't be drawn on further details. But his recollections of other record-breaking sales paint a compelling picture of high drama and pressured decision-making.

His auction day role -- which the 45-year-old admits is ""quite stressful"" -- sees him telling telephone bidders what's happening in the room. This means relaying the auctioneer's words and price increments in real-time, as well as communicating details about potential rivals (revealing the identity of other phone bidders is, however, ""a big no-no,"" Rotter stressed).

Many of Rotter's interlocutors are long-term clients. So he's also on hand to offer advice -- how much similar artworks sold for, or how a bidding war might unfold. And then, by Rotter's own admission, there's an element of gentle encouragement. Auctioneering is a commissions business, after all (and the so-called ""buyer's premium"" at Christie's ranges from about 13% to 30% of the winning bid).

What might surprise those outside the art world, however, is that his wealthy clients don't always have a maximum price in mind -- even when it comes to multimillion-dollar paintings.

""I've heard people on the telephone say, 'Alex, let's just buy it, no matter how far it goes,' and I've heard people (say), 'I have a limit, and don't even ask me if we reach (it) because I don't want to be tempted,'"" revealed Rotter.

""People have different strategies for how to go about it. I do think people get carried away.

""Competition attracts everyone, and on auction night, you're in the bidding process and it's a little bit of a race. People don't like to lose.""

In recent years, Rotter has become a familiar sight in the so-called ""phone bank,"" the line of well-heeled go-betweens covering their mouths as they confer with anonymous buyers. Last November, he made another world record bid -- this time on behalf of an unidentified client pursuing David Hockney's ""Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures)."" At $90.3 million, the sale marked the highest sum ever paid for the work of a living artist.

This record was broken again, just six months later, by Jeff Koons' $91.1-million ""Rabbit"" sculpture. And although Rotter wasn't on the winning client's side this time, he was nonetheless instrumental in bringing the artwork to auction.

Indeed, despite his public-facing role, most of the Austrian's work happens in the weeks and months prior to a sale. As well as conceiving of auction themes and populating them with relevant works, he serves as something of an art-world matchmaker, filling gaps in collectors' portfolios and tracking down the world's most sought-after paintings.

'Dream of big numbers'

Identifying targets means knowing art intimately -- and seeing lots of it too. The journey to bring Koons' ""Rabbit"" to auction began with Rotter's personal encounter with the sculpture at the Newhouse Apartment gallery in New York at the beginning of the last decade: ""I remember saying to my colleagues, 'one day...'"" he recalled.

Even at the highest echelons of the art market, such instincts outweigh number-crunching. Data ""substantiates the intuition and gut feeling experts have,"" Rotter said.

Hailing from a family of Austrian art dealers, these instincts are, undoubtedly, finely tuned. He made his first sale, aged 13, at his mother's booth at a Vienna art and antiques fair, where he sold an early 19th-century porcelain cup and saucer for the equivalent of $1,000, and a watercolor by Austrian painter Rudolf von Alt for 10 times that.

""My mother had to help in the final round of negotiation as I didn't want to give more than a 10% discount and the guy insisted on more,"" he recalled. ""But I remember the feeling of closing a sale and it had me hooked.""

Thirty years on, closing deals is still the endgame. When desired artworks are identified, it's often Rotter's job to convince their owners to part company with them. Such discussions involve not only an item's valuation, but negotiations over fees and the size of the opening bid (""In an ideal world, you start lower than you think it would make, and then have it run"").

For the aforementioned Hockney painting, whose owner Christie's courted for a year and a half, it was a case of making them ""dream of big numbers,"" as Rotter recalled.

""People who own $80 million paintings are (going) to be savvy and smart. They didn't just sign on the dotted line. They made it competitive. So, after us, they also went to the other auction houses and asked them for opinions, values, pitches.

""There was some price resistance,"" he added, ""Hockney's world record (at the time) was $25 million, and here was a painting that was expected to sell for $80 million.""

But while Rotter estimates that bidding usually starts between 30% and 50% of the expected price, the Hockney auction opened low, at just $20 million -- a quarter of Christie's top estimate. The gamble paid off, as bids soared past $90 million.

""At the end of the day, we got our result by starting low and tempting (bidders) ... so it worked out beautifully.""

Market pressures

With collectors increasingly shopping for art on Instagram and looking beyond Western marketplaces for returns, there are plenty of challenges facing European auction houses.

In July, research firm ArtTactic reported that Christie's, Sotheby's and Phillips had posted a collective 20.3% year-on-year drop in sales in the first half of 2019. Indeed, if it weren't for the $450 million auction of the ""Salvator Mundi"" in 2017, and Peggy and David Rockefeller's huge $832 million private art collection in 2018, then both of these years might have been considered disappointing for Christie's, too.

This recent dip may not concern an auction market known for its volatility. For all the ups and downs of the last decade, global auction sales in 2018 were, at $29.1 billion, slightly above 2008 levels, according to Art Basel and UBS' authoritative Global Art Market Report

But sales of art and antiques online -- whether from auction houses' websites or internet retailers -- have exploded, almost doubling between 2013 and 2018. Online transactions may represent a small chunk of the art market, at $6 billion, but growth looks set to continue. Generation Z collectors are more than twice as likely than their millennial or generation X counterparts to prefer buying art on the internet, the same report found.

With their wood-paneled rooms, corded telephones and paper catalogs, the old auction houses of New York and London appear increasingly antiquated. Nonetheless, Christie's is adapting to the digital age -- more than 250 years after its founding. Last year, it hosted 88 web-only auctions, and generated online sales of $250 million (up by more than 16% from 2016, the year Rotter arrived from arch rival Sotheby's).

It's still a brick-and-mortar business. But Rotter is confident that his employer -- now owned by French billionaire François Pinault -- can use heritage to its advantage.

""There is obviously something very traditional, something charming about (auctions) -- that it's still wooden benches (and) telephones,"" he said. ""There's obviously a digital technology revolution going on in the auction business. A lot of the transactions happen online now. (But) the spectacle of the evening sale stays the same.

""People like to dress up; they like to come to the auction or to participate in it somehow,"" he added. ""It's serious art we're selling, but it's still an event.""

Moreover, he depicts big-ticket auctions as being uniquely democratic -- great levelers through which an artwork's market value emerges in real-time. Or as Rotter put it: ""Who bids the most gets the painting. There's no trickery, there's no advantage for someone who comes first or has a bigger name. That's the beauty of it.""

When it comes to the art itself, however, bigger names command bigger prices. So which painting is the holy grail of the market -- the one artwork his clients all want but can't have?

""There are a handful of objects,"" Rotter said. ""I'm not talking about pieces that are hanging in MoMA or the Metropolitan Museum, because they will never be obtainable. But there is (always) one object that still sits in a private collection -- this one Van Gogh, this one Warhol, this one Koons -- that everyone wants.

""Obviously, I have this list in my office. It lives there -- I know it by heart -- with little thumbnail images.

""You always try,"" he concluded, adding: ""Always shoot for the masterpieces.""

Jacopo Prisco,The unsung car designer who created the DeLorean and James Bond's underwater car,"Jacopo Prisco , CNN Written by

Few other designers have been as influential as Giorgetto Giugiaro in shaping modern automobiles. In a career spanning 64 years he has designed some of the most successful and influential cars in history, ranging from one-of-a-kind exotics to mass market utility vehicles.

He's designed over 200 cars for manufacturers around the world which collectively put over 60 million cars on the road and -- at the age of 81 -- is still working today. Having sold his design practice Italdesign in 2015, he continues to design, now with his son Fabrizio, under the roof of a new firm called GFG Style.

































1 / 17 – Alfa Romeo Iguana (1969) Italian designer Giorgetto Giugiaro has created some of the most successful and influential cars in history, in an impressive career that spans over six decades. This is the 1969 Alfa Romeo Iguana concept, one of the cars that Giugiaro used as an inspiration for the design of the DeLorean a decade later, along with his 1970 Porsche Tapiro concept.

Birth of a legend

Born in 1938 in Garessio, about 60 miles South of Turn, Giugiaro came into the world at the prime time and place for a young boy who would eventually become a gifted designer. Fiat, Italy's flagship automaker, was an hour's drive away and the country's post-war economic boom would coincide with Giugiaro's coming of age. In fact, Giugiaro joined FIAT as early as he possibly could -- when he was just 17 -- but not because he was eager to draw cars.

""I got involved with cars not out of passion, but as a part of my creative process,"" he said in a phone interview from his studio in Moncalieri, just outside Turin.

The Giugiaros were a family of artists and Giorgetto was supposed to pursue a similar path. His father, however, noticed that he had a more technical inclination, and so allowed him to go to art school by day and study technical design in the evenings.

Dante Giacosa, FIAT's technical director, saw some of his car sketches and hired him as a junior designer. ""I joined FIAT in 1955 to have an experience outside of the arts world, not really knowing where it would lead to. This experience was more valuable than a school and gave me confidence to experiment with my creativity.""

After four formative years at Fiat, Giugiaro's work was noticed by Nuccio Bertone, who ran one of several influential coachbuilding ateliers that had sprung up around Turin at the time, including Ghia, Pininfarina and Vignale. Bertone's firm made its name by styling beautiful cars for other manufacturers, and put Giugiaro at work on some forward-thinking projects.

""In 1960 I saw my first prototypes come to life at Bertone: The Gordon-Keeble GT, the Alfa Romeo 2600 and the Giulia GT, which I finished as I was drafted for the then obligatory military service. I was 22.""

After creating cars at Bertone under badges such as BMW, Mazda and Ferrari, Giugiaro switched jobs again in 1965, joining Bertone's competitor Ghia. There, he designed two of his most beautiful cars, the Maserati Ghibli and the De Tomaso Mangusta.

The Mangusta went on to become a minor icon among sports car enthusiasts, although only around 400 were produced. Its passenger doors open normally, the design features gullwing doors for the engine and luggage compartment, a truly unique styling quirk. It's Bill's car in ""Kill Bill: Volume 2,"" it features in the film ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" and in Kylie Minogue's ""Can't Get You Out of My Head"" music video.

The Italdesign era

In 1967 , aged 29 but with 12 years of work experience, Giugiaro started his own design firm, Italdesign, and moved heavily into mass produced cars, shaping some of the world's most successful people movers. As a designer, this is the type of work he preferred. ""The mass-produced car, as a project, has many variables, including timing, costs, feasibility, directors, marketing -- the creative aspect isn't hard, but the mediation between all these variables is. That makes it more gratifying,"" he said.

""The hedonistic car, the car that everybody wants but nearly nobody can have, is a lot easier do to, because it's created for publicity, it doesn't have to rely on a complex structure.""

In 1974 he was asked to design the successor of the Beetle for Volkswagen. The resulting first generation Golf -- known as the Rabbit in the US -- debuted Giugiaro's ""origami period,"" a new styling sensibility dominated by sharp, angular lines. It would influence car design for generations, and create one of the most resounding success stories in the automotive world: The Golf, currently in its seventh generation, is still the undisputed leader in its sector, with sales to date in excess of 30 million units.

Despite his growing fame, Giugiaro kept a low profile. ""When Volkswagen asked me if I wanted to have a badge on every Golf they built that read 'design by Giugiaro,' I said 'No, thanks.' It would have cost me more to send them thousands of badges every day than the money I got from the entire project! When people buy a car, they don't generally care about who designed it. Cars are not artworks. Art is prestigious, but cars are not.""

Movie icons

Giugiaro applied his sharp-edged, origami style to cars that were meant for wildly different purposes and markets.

In 1976 he designed the Esprit for English automaker Lotus, which became James Bond's car in the following year's ""The Spy Who Loved Me,"" famously transforming into a submarine. The very car that was used for the film's underwater scenes was purchased by Elon Musk in 2013 for nearly $1 million.

Shortly after, Giugiaro styled the DeLorean, a 2-door coupe launched in 1981 that was consigned to immortality when Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale picked it as Marty McFly's car for ""Back to the Future"" in 1985. Giugiaro based the DeLorean on the Tapiro, a 1970 concept car he had created for Porsche. It was similarly wedge-shaped and, most importantly, sported a stainless steel body with gullwing doors.

""I didn't expect that it could be picked as a movie car,"" he said. ""Its unpainted look is due to the fact that DeLorean didn't want to spend anything on painting equipment, so he went with stainless steel, but that didn't come without problems. I'm glad when someone remembers that I designed it.""

Around the same time, during a fruitful collaboration with Fiat, he designed the two affordable and compact cars of the 1980s for the Italian automaker: the well-known Uno and the Panda.

With its brutally basic design, Giugiaro's Panda was the opposite of a bedroom poster car in its heyday, but it's now attracting a cult following, the ""4x4"" version especially. In a 1980 interview to Italian newspaper La Stampa, Giugiaro described the Panda as ""a pair of jeans: a simple, practical, no-frills piece of clothing."" He likened the design to that of a military helicopter: ""a light, rational machine designed for a specific purpose.""

More than cars

Giugiaro's designs extend beyond the automotive industry thanks to an industrial design division of Italdesign, launched in 1974. Since then he's designed the Nikon F5 camera trains for the Riyadh metro, a professional coffee machine , a dentist chair, several Beretta guns, sewing machines, watches, tractors, motorbikes and the stadium for Turin's football team Juventus FC, and perhaps the most unexpected -- a pasta shape called Marille.

""These were a great way to fill the dead times between car projects -- but the creative process and technique are exactly the same as a car, there's no difference. It's more liberating, because it lets me escape the normative hell of cars, which are full of rules and regulations,"" said Giugiaro.

Today, Giugiaro is no longer involved with Italdesign, after Volkswagen -- through its subsidiary Audi -- first acquired 90% of its shares in 2010 , then the remaining 10% in 2015 . But he's still designing cars: One of his latest creations, presented at the Geneva Motor Show in 2018 in celebration of his 80th birthday, is an electric concept named Sybilla (after his mother, Maria Sibilla).

Whenever he sees one of his own creations on the road, he has a simple thought: ""I notice what I could have done better. I'm always thinking about the future, about doing what I couldn't have done before. So, in a way, I'm constantly working even when I'm not working.""

There is, however, something he would have liked to design but never got the chance to: ""I love the design of modern fighter jets and even space ships that you see in the movies. I would have enjoyed designing a plane.""

Aileen Kwun,Fashion gaffes are a reflection of the industry's diversity problem,"Written by Aileen Kwun, CNN Contributors Oscar Holland, CNN Stephy Chung, CNN

Last month, fashion house Chanel appointed its first head of diversity and inclusion. Announcing the hire, the French brand said it hoped to provide ""momentum"" for its ""existing diversity and inclusion approach.""

The move marked Chanel's entry into a new race in the world of luxury fashion: the race to hire more diverse talents, and thus lessen the chance of becoming the latest brand to alienate potential customers with racially or culturally insensitive gaffes.

About two weeks later, Gucci then appointed a new global head of diversity, equity and inclusion in order to ""create a more inclusive and equitable workplace and increase workforce diversity."" Prada and Burberry, too, have created a similar position in recent months.

These announcements all appear to be part of the fashion industry's response to accusations that it's out of touch with customers and society at large.

These missteps differ from one another in important ways. Burberry's noose touched on issues of mental health, while the Prada outrage was a matter of race. Gucci's turban, or its balaclava sweater resembling blackface (pictured top), generated backlash in existing markets, while D&G's ads alienated new ones. But what they collectively reveal is that the fashion industry is struggling -- at times -- to keep up with tech-savvy consumers who are ready to call out companies in real-time for insensitive imagery.

Hiring diversity advocates might seem like a sensible way to address fashion's troubling tendency to use stereotypes or cultural appropriation to turn a profit. But the new Chanel appointment has not been without its own controversy: Many on social media expressed their dismay that a white woman, Fiona Pargeter, had been named to the role.

Teen Vogue's fashion and beauty features director Tahirah Hairston took to Twitter to ask , ""why did chanel hire a white woman to be over diversity and inclusion? who is in that room?""

Another user wrote: ""white privilege is hiring a Head of Diversity and Inclusion who isn't a POC @CHANEL.""

In a statement e-mailed to CNN, Chanel said Pargeter's appointment ""is a sign of our commitment to D&I (diversity and inclusion) and its importance to the House.""

The brand declined to comment on questions about its decision to hire Pargeter at a time when fashion industry statistics show that people of color are far less likely to be hired for influential roles than white people. In 2018, The Business of Fashion found diversity to be lacking at the highest levels of leadership after studying 15 of the largest public companies in fashion.

From the outside, it seems obvious that hiring a white woman to lead diversity efforts might elicit a backlash. The blackface and chopstick gaffes seemed even more predictable, playing on racist tropes that have circulated for centuries. So why do they keep happening?

Fashion's new watchdogs

With designers and brands now contending with instant reactions from social media and a 24-hour news cycle, the backlash has become a fierce, tangible force with real consequences for sales.

Fashion's watchdogs -- once a select group of buyers and editors at closed-door runway shows -- are now online influencers and social media accounts, followed by people who might not even buy luxury brands, but are nonetheless vocal critics in cultural debates over ethics and representation.

Take the snarky Diet Prada , an Instagram account (with a cult following of 1.5 million ""Dieters"") that calls out copycat scandals and hypocrisy in the fashion industry. It has been credited with, among other things, fanning the flames of D&G's self-inflicted woes.

Social media has spread fashion -- and its critique -- faster and wider. And the reputational risks of insensitive blunders are real, potentially prompting boycotts that can cost brands millions.

But controversial campaigns and products are nothing new in the industry. Fashion has a long, fraught history of systemic racism, explains Valerie Steele, chief curator and director of the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York.

The industry has been rife with biases and insensitivities toward underrepresented and marginalized groups. Blackface caricatures are images that have persisted since the 19th century, she noted, ""and in the 1920s and '30s, fashion companies would use the n-word, for example, to describe a particular shade of brown"" in marketing materials. ""It was a fairly common practice in the UK, not so much in the US.""

Meanwhile, stereotypical depictions of Asians can be traced back nearly a hundred years with the popularization of conical straw ""coolie"" hats -- a derogatory reference to Southeast Asian laborers that was later appeared to influence Dior's ""New Look"" headgear in the 1940s and again various 1970s Yves Saint Laurent collections inspired by Asia.

Sales of the YSL perfume ""Opium"" appeared to benefit from protests against the scent's name, which many felt trivialized China's painful history of drug abuse and the Opium Wars. The scandal created a notoriety that helped make the scent a bestseller.

""We certainly keep seeing gaffes today, and it leaves one flabbergasted,"" Steele said in a phone interview. ""How do these things even get greenlighted? Who in the world, for example, thought that D&G's ad campaign, insulting and patronizing the Chinese model, would appeal to a Chinese audience? It's absolutely absurd.""

While the D&G ad campaign incensed some viewers, it was Stefano Gabbana's alleged trail of offensive Instagram direct messages that spurred Chinese audiences to boycott the brand, leading a number of online retailers to pull the brand entirely. Gabbana denied sending the derogatory messages, but the damage had been done.

""The reality is, brands have to be more nuanced,"" Steele added. ""Not every form of cultural appropriation is, or needs to be, egregious. But some of them have proven to be deeply offensive, over and over again, and yet we keep seeing them.""

Why brands miss the mark

Whether the result of careless mistakes, willful ignorance or even a cynical ploy for headlines, the recent slew of fashion gaffes may not stem from a single cause. Yet, they share a common characteristic: brands pursuing profit at the expense of cultural sensitivity.

This is particularly the case in China, where European fashion houses are competing to court a new generation of wealthy shoppers.

Here, D&G is not alone in having upset potential customers. Earlier this year, Burberry faced criticism after it marked Chinese New Year with a series of family-portrait-style photos that were ridiculed as ""creepy"" by social media users.

Fashion is full of elaborate cultural code switch, reference and pastiche. In the race to corner new markets, brands have a history of charging in with limited knowledge of the local audiences they seek to entice.

This raises questions about the process that goes into formulating a campaign, and the resources allocated to researching the market.

Former Elle China editor, Ye Zi, also known as Leaf Greener , said the cultural divide between Western and Asian audiences must be bridged in order to move forward. The Beijing native now works as a creative consultant for brands like Chloé, helping to facilitate conversations between staff in Western headquarters and their colleagues in China, while offering insight into Chinese consumers.

She believes that fashion houses must look to hire people who live in, or have previously lived in, the countries and markets being targeted.

""These people should have knowledge of their own country, but also understand what's going on globally.

""With China and Western countries, there's a big gap,"" she said, noting that cultural misunderstandings can go both ways. ""Even (Beijing and Shanghai) can feel like two different cultures or countries. That's something most people outside of China wouldn't understand -- not to mention basic things like the number of dialects used here.""

Tapping the Chinese market is about more than its buying power, she added, suggesting that brands would benefit from showing more respect to their target audiences' cultures. She cited the Hermès-backed Chinese lifestyle brand, Shang Xia, founded by Shanghai-born Jiang Qiong Er, as an example of a smart business move -- one that allowed the French fashion giant to show respect for Chinese consumers, and a vested interest, both financial and cultural, in the country's traditional craftsmanship.

More than money

There is clearly no shortage of money at Europe's biggest fashion houses, and China's rise as the world's fastest-growing consumer market makes it the target of many new products and campaigns. Chinese consumers account for nearly a third of spending on luxury goods worldwide, according to a recent report by consultancy firm Bain & Company.

The D&G incident last November serves as a cautionary tale. It is difficult to calculate the amount of money a brand loses in the fallout of a scandal like this, but they can stand to lose millions if campaigns backfire and customers boycott. Within days of the private messages becoming public, one Chinese e-commerce site said it had removed nearly 60,000 D&G products. But understanding a foreign audience's culture isn't a matter of money, according to Steele.

If more Chinese people were involved in planning the D&G campaign, she said, there may not have been as many errors. ""Giving diverse voices a seat at the table isn't enough,"" she argued, saying that those employees also need to be valued and ""in a position that isn't threatened or penalized for speaking up.""

""You can't just have change in terms of representation, like a rainbow coalition on the runway,"" she said. ""You really have to have diversity in terms of who's in power: Who owns the company, who designs for the company, who does the advertising? You need diversity all the way through the entire power structure, not just the face of the brand.""

Steele and Greener both allude to a broader theory that links overseas missteps with offense caused by the people in headquarters in the West: that these gaffes all directly reflect homogeneity in fashion's upper echelons. Just as involving Chinese people may help heighten brands' sensitivity towards China, hiring more black people or Sikhs -- in London, Milan or New York -- might have stopped garments offending those communities from making it past the drawing board.

And the industry's problematic lack of diversity isn't just racial -- it may also reflect socioeconomic inequalities.

""Increasingly, you have to be rich to break into (fashion), because you're getting paid so little at the start, and are less likely to be able to afford unpaid internships,"" said Steele.

""On top of everything else, you have a climate which many people say is one of bullying and conformism, (and) which is hostile to anybody who does not fall within the parameters of whatever clique has the power to make decisions.""

This pervasive culture makes it easier for prejudices to go unchallenged, according to New York-based stylist Ashley Owens, who founded the independent art and fashion magazine Suited in 2015.

""Racism, sexism and homophobia are so ingrained that you actually have to be mentally fighting those biases within yourself constantly,"" she said in a phone interview. ""In order to really change that system, it takes individual, incremental change in the day to day.""

Steps toward accountability

Brands are slowly starting to recognize that they must embrace inclusion within their own ranks if they are to achieve global appeal.

In January, the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) and PVH, the parent company of brands like Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, published a briefing on inclusivity and diversity, making an ethical and creative case for embracing both.

""The (American) fashion industry ... has so far struggled to reflect the country's diversity in its workforce across all levels,"" the briefing stated. ""It's crucial for our industry to understand that diversity and inclusion are not a trend, but the way every company should operate.""

As the report articulated, diversity is ""simply a measure of difference"" within a company -- be it race, age, gender, ability or sexual orientation -- while inclusion goes further, creating ""a climate in which diverse individuals come together to form a collective whole."" Only then, perhaps, will fashion house employees feel empowered to speak out against campaigns or products that are so obviously going to cause offense.

The current disconnect between diversity and inclusion in fashion's ivory tower is clear. The major players are, still, overwhelmingly white. Fewer than 4% of the Council of Fashion Designers of America's (CFDA) members listed on its website are black, and until the September 2018 issue, the cover of US Vogue had never been shot by an African-American photographer.

The industry is also overwhelmingly male. In the US, women may spend three times more on clothing than men, but only 14% of major brands are led by a female executive, according to a 2015 Business of Fashion survey of 50 global brands.

Remedies will take time, and the CFDA's report outlines a number of long-term goals. Attitudes within fashion may be no more offensive than in other homogenous industries, but its public-facing role exposes it to far greater scrutiny. For now, the threat of coordinated action spreading online may be the most powerful force keeping brands in check.

While no fashion house has explicitly blamed their transgressions on insufficient in-house diversity, their responses to controversy offer a tacit acceptance of its role. Shortly after Prada's blackface accessories were withdrawn, the brand announced that two influential African-American cultural figures, artist Theaster Gates and director Ava DuVernay, would lead a new advisory council that will ""elevate voices of color.""

And when Gucci withdrew the aforementioned balaclava sweater from sale, it published an apology alongside what it called a commitment to increase diversity throughout the organization. (It later launched the Gucci Changemakers program, with a particular focus on targeting African-American communities and youth, and announced a $5 million fund ""to support social change by investing in community-based programs.)

Burberry soon followed suit, announcing plans to establish employee councils focused on diversity and inclusion, and telling CNN by email that it is rolling out inclusive leadership workshops and mandatory unconscious bias training. Whether such initiatives bring about meaningful change remains to be seen.

But they are, at least, an attempt to right some of the industry's wrongs, rather than simply apologizing and pulling offensive items from the shelves.

Hannah Ritchie,Meet North Korea's art dealer to the West,"Written by Hannah Ritchie, CNN Pontassieve, Italy Contributors Muhammad Darwish

In a sleepy town in Tuscany, over 8,000 kilometers from Pyongyang, you can find one of the West's largest collections of North Korean art. The man behind the operation, Pier Luigi Cecioni, has been bringing North Korean artworks to Pontassieve -- a small commune just a stone's throw from Florence -- for over 10 years.

The pieces in his collection all come from the same Pyongyang art studio, Mansudae. With an estimated 4,000 employees, it is the largest state-run art house in North Korea -- and one of the largest art production centers in the world.

Cecioni formed his working relationship with Mansudae back in 2005, when, during an official tour of the country with an Italian orchestra, he asked to look at some North Korean art.

Mansudae produces an array of artworks, including woodcuts, oil paintings, charcoal drawings, embroideries and even jeweled paintings.

""Once I was there, I said, 'I'm actually very interested in art -- do you have anything to show me?'"" Cecioni said in his studio. ""They brought me to Mansudae's studio. Nobody had ever heard of it (in) the West, so I asked them whether they would they be interested in doing some business in the West, and they said 'sure.'""

With over 1.2 million square feet of studio space, Mansudae produces an array of artworks, including woodcuts, oil paintings, charcoal drawings, embroideries and even jeweled paintings made from semi-precious stones. Cecioni sells them all, with prices ranging from $300 to $7,000, depending on the size and detail of the work.

The best-sellers, he explained, have been hand-painted propaganda posters, which are the most affordable and have proven popular with art collectors.

Cecioni sells works from Mansudae for $300 to $7,000.

Cecioni said that dealing with the state-run art house has proven to be surprisingly easy. ""Doing business with North Korea is, in a way, very old fashioned,"" he said. ""They're very trustworthy. What they say, they do. And what you say, you have to do.""

How Cecioni imports the artworks -- some of which are over two meters wide -- is similarly straightforward: ""There is DHL in Pyongyang. So they are sent through DHL to us, and they arrive in five days,"" he said.

Sanctions taking effect

Beyond the world of art collectors, Mansudae is best known for large bronze statues, which can be found in African countries such as Namibia and Senegal.

The sale of these socialist-style statues has, however, come under scrutiny from the United Nations, which last year blacklisted the studio as part of tightening sanctions against Kim Jong Un's regime. It is believed that the monuments were being paid for in cash or land, helping North Korea evade existing sanctions and take in millions of dollars in income.

Cecioni imports artworks from Pyongyang using DHL.

""This money is highly significant,"" the coordinator of the UN Panel of Experts on North Korea, Hugh Griffiths, told CNN in December 2017. ""We are looking at at least 14 African (UN) member states where Mansudae alone was running quite large construction operations.""

Cecioni only deals in two-dimensional art, claiming that Mansudae's statue business is separate from the studio's main operation -- despite being run under the same name.

""It's like a big art company, there are many branches,"" he said. ""The money they received from us essentially goes back into running the studio. The very large statues -- that's Mansudae, but it's so different from the other things they do. It's definitely a multi-million-dollar enterprise, so I'm sure there is some direction from the (state).""

Cecioni said last year's UN sanctions has affected his business, as he's no longer able to import North Korean art.

Despite Cecioni's convictions that the art he buys plays no significant role in generating income for the regime, his business was still impacted by last year's UN sanctions.

""The sanctions that are on Mansudae specifically -- I think they were not well placed,"" he said. ""I don't think they had the right perception of what Mansudae really is. They aimed at the statues, and they also hit the things we do, which are irrelevant for the economy of the country.""

Cecioni's ability to acquire new works has come to a sudden halt. ""The sanctions on my business have had a tremendous effect, because we cannot import anymore,"" he said.

Best-sellers, according to Cecioni, have been hand-painted propaganda posters.

But while the Italian is not bringing in any new artworks, he still has over 300 pieces in storage. Demand from international customers hasn't slowed, he said.

But instead of selling from his existing stockpile, Cecioni has begun rejecting sales, saying that the art has always been difficult to accurately value, and that he wants to keep the works he has on hand until he can start importing again.

""We are not really trying to sell anymore,"" he said, ""because we cannot replenish our inventory.""",2020-07-14,https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/north-korea-art-dealer-pier-luigi-cecioni/index.html
Nick Glass,David Hockney at 80: An encounter with the world's most popular artist,"David Hockney's home studio is set deep in the Hollywood Hills. We drive there from Sunset Boulevard, past sweeping views of the canyon below, 1920s Art Deco homes and modernist glass boxes perched at intervals on the hillside.

The ""English Angelino,"" as he sometimes refers to himself, lives in a corner house off the main road, just where the hill flattens out. A verdant, anonymous compound behind high gray fences, it's quiet, with no through traffic. With only a four-figure number on the door and a buzzer, there is no hint that this has, since 1979, been home to one of the world's most recognizable and popular artists.

We are buzzed in and directed up a short path to Hockney's studio, a building set aside from his home. From here, it is hard to make out his actual house, which is apparently a series of one- and two-story buildings -- bungalows almost -- enveloped in plants and shrubs. There are steps down, and somewhere tantalizingly out of sight is Hockney's famous swimming pool, a recurring subject in his paintings.

David Hockney at 80: A rare encounter with the artist

The studio -- a long, white, airy space with a staircase leading up to a gallery -- is a converted paddle tennis court. Upon entering, we see half a dozen or so works in progress. Hockney is preparing for a show at Pace Gallery in New York in April.

We hear him before we see him -- his hacking smoker's cough, to be precise. At 80 (and a half), Hockney is sitting in a favorite comfy armchair, reading the Financial Times. He peers up inquisitively through owlish glasses, before struggling up to greet us. He's wearing a blue and green striped cardigan (familiar to me from recent photos) and paint-spattered trousers, his once vibrantly dyed blonde hair now gray and thinning. He clutches a cigarette packet in one hand.

I'm little nervous at the beginning and don't want the interview to start before the cameras are ready to roll. We've arrived with three cameras to capture Hockney's every gesture, every laugh and every cigarette drag (he smokes three or four cigarettes during the interview).

“ I think I've not done so bad in my life for the last 64 years ... Every day I've done what I want to do. ” David Hockney

Making polite conversation, his assistant J.P. asks where I'm staying. I name a new boutique hotel on Sunset that he hasn't heard of. I complain about the lighting design in my room, which was so moodily dim that I couldn't find the bedside light switches. Evidently no one reads in bed these days -- the dominant fixture is a giant TV.

Hockney quickly interjects: ""Yes, they are just big voids,"" he says, referring to the TV screens. ""I don't like voids.""

Painting the pool

Hockney says that his swimming pool was also looking ""a bit like a void,"" so in the summer, the day before his 80th birthday, he had it drained so he could repaint the bottom himself with arcs of blue.

""Once it was painted, it made you see all the plants,"" he says. The job took him two and half hours, ""and that's how long it took me 20 years ago.""

Hockney's ex-lover, Gregory Evans, who lives next door and runs the business side of things for him, apparently questioned whether he was up to the job. ""Of course, I thought I could do it,"" he says a little defiantly.

He admits that he is stubborn, and you can sense a fierce willpower. He is not happy with the shade of blue -- it's ""a bit too pale"" -- and he may do it again. An hour or so later, after the interview is over, I politely ask if we can film his swimming pool. No, says Hockney -- ""Gregory wouldn't like it.""

A bigger retrospective

The pretext for our visit is Hockney's 80th birthday retrospective, which has already drawn well over a million visitors to London's Tate Britain, the Pompidou Centre in Paris, and The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.

""I realize it is the last time (a retrospective) will be done in my lifetime,"" says Hockney. And that's the truth of it.

I ask him how this retrospective compares with the one in 1988 (around the time of his 50th birthday). ""Well,"" comes the blunt reply, ""it's 30 years later, 30 years more painting. A big difference, 30 years.""

We both laugh and I blush a little with embarrassment. It's arguably a stupid question, but there is also a feeling that Hockney wants his later work to receive the same attention that his paintings from the 1960s and 70s did.

Throughout the interview Hockney is his usual chatty, funny, contrary, bee-in-his-bonnet self. Naturally, he mentions smoking more than once -- ""Sixty-five years ago. I began smoking and they were called 'coffin nails' then.""

His father had been ""a big anti-smoker but (he died from) eating chocolate biscuits at 75. I'm five years older than him now,"" he says with a certain relish.

Fish and chips

Having first achieved success in his early 20s, Hockney has long been financially comfortable. But it seems that money never mattered that much to him, providing he has enough to run his studios.

He has always been generous by nature. I mention an early lithograph he gave away in 1954 -- the interior of a Yorkshire fish and chip shop with a 17-year-old art student, elbow on the counter, patiently waiting for his food to arrive.

""Yes I remember it. I remember drawing it on a lithographic stone they had at the art school in Bradford (in West Yorkshire).""

Hockney has astonishing recall. There were only ""about five copies,"" he says. I tell him that the copy that he gave to the shop's owners recently sold at auction for just under £19,000 ($27,000). Hockney shrugs; he's not remotely bothered. He's well aware that his work has risen hugely in value.

One of the first people to acquire Hockney's art was his friend and fellow student at London's Royal College of Art, the late R.B. Kitaj, in the early 1960s. Kitaj paid £5 ($7) for a drawing of a skeleton. ""That was quite a lot of money then,"" Hockney says, recalling being pleased that he was then able to buy cigarettes in packs of 20 rather than 10.

Hockney holds on to much of his own work, and has set up a foundation to look after it. I mention how much I admire his drawings of his mother, who died age 99 in 1999 (he painted her virtually every time he visited her). Hockney hints that he may exhibit them one day.

A gay pioneer

Hockney recalls the royal photographer, Cecil Beaton , purchasing one of his more sexually explicit paintings, ""Adhesiveness,"" for less than $60.

""I remember delivering it to his house,"" he tells me. ""He had it for 40 years."" The money helped pay for Hockney's first visit to New York in 1961.

We sometimes forget that, as a gay man in the public eye, Hockney was a pioneer of sorts -- an artist too honest not to paint his desires. Fresh out of college, he celebrated his sexuality through his work at a time when gay sex was still outlawed in England (it wasn't legalized until 1967). Those early pictures ""look rather good and stand up,"" he says.

'I feel 30 in the studio'

It's difficult to imagine Hockney not working. His work ethic is utterly engrained.

Hockney likes to paint in silence, ""to look, and look again."" Unlike Lucian Freud, for whom Hockney sat for a portrait for a total of 120 hours, he doesn't talk much to his sitters. Freud, he says, was ""amusing, gossipy and bitchy about other artists.""

Hockney laughs but doesn't elaborate. Both artists attended royal lunches as members of the Order of Merit, and he confides that Freud was always better at conversing with the Queen, as they had a common interest in horse racing.

Hanging by the studio staircase is Hockney's design for a six-meter (20 feet) high stained-glass window honoring the Queen, which is set to be unveiled in Westminster Abbey in October (we are quickly told that we can't film it). Suffice to say, it shows nature at her most glorious.

The image was drawn from memory on an iPad and features a favorite subject, hawthorn blossom. Hockney was obviously inspired by his prolonged stay in Yorkshire (2005-2013) where, year after year, he painted the seasons en plein air. A composite photo shows how it will appear once it's installed by the Abbey's transept. It looks splendid, enlivening an august religious space.

Every day, Hockney paints for six or seven hours. ""I'm perfectly happy doing this,"" he says. ""I feel 30 when I'm in the studio, so I come in every day and work, because then I feel 30.""

Hockney never seems to stop thinking about work. He takes iPad images of his current paintings to bed, so he can look at them and know ""what to do straight away"" the next morning. Painting is Hockney's be-all and end-all.

Our interview is regularly punctuated by his smoker's laugh, a guttural infectious chuckle. But he also seems older and more fragile, perhaps a tacit awareness of mortality. More than ever, he is reluctant to leave his studio -- his refuge, his cave.

He doesn't want to walk far or go to restaurants where he can't hear anything (he has got progressively deafer in recent years, and wears hearing aids in both ears). He is less and less keen on flying, disliking both long flights and travelling alone.

""Travelling, I feel 80,"" he says poignantly.

A bigger book

For almost the first time in his life, Hockney has begun looking back at his work in its entirety to reflect on his exhilarating artistic journey. Implicit in our conversation is the sense of an artist reflecting on his place in art history. And his undeniable conclusion is: ""Yes, I've made a few memorable pictures. I know that now.""

A crucial moment in this self-reflection has been the release of ""A Bigger Book,"" a 77-pound ""sumo"" book published in 2016. It is, he acknowledges, his autobiography.

""Well, I realized,"" says Hockney, flipping through the pages, ""that this would last 100 years. Most people will see my work in this book. So why not make it good?""

""A Bigger Splash"" (1967) by David Hockney Credit: Tate

His own copy -- which comes on a bespoke stand designed by Marc Newson -- is within easy reach, a few feet from his armchair. ""I keep looking through it,' he admits.

""I think I've not done so bad in my life for the last 64 years,"" he muses. ""Every day I've done what I want to do.""

""That's a privilege', I say. ""I know I'm privileged,"" comes the reply, ""I've always known that I was privileged.""

Hanging on the wall, just by the studio entrance, is a framed handwritten note. It was pressed into Hockney's hand by a stranger while he was visiting a museum. It reads: ""Thank you for brightening our world.""

""That was OK, wasn't it?"" he asks rather sweetly at the end of the interview. ""Yes,"" I exclaim, ""more than OK. Thank you!"" And it's true. Hockney has been in fine fettle -- funny and characteristically open, two of the many reasons why he has been so admired and loved for so long.

On camera, the years seemed to fall away. He sparkles and looks momentarily boyish. Before we wind our way back down the Hollywood Hills, he signs my Hockney book for me -- ""with love, David and a kiss"" -- and sees us out with a gentle handshake.

Jonathan Chatwin,The Shenzhen effect: Why China's original 'model' city matters more than ever,"Written by Jonathan Chatwin, CNN

Jonathan Chatwin is a writer, journalist and author of books including "" Long Peace Street: A Walk in Modern China .""

By 2035, China's government expects over 70% of the country's population -- around a billion people -- to be living in cities.

Both Shanghai and Beijing have announced population limits and are implementing policies to reduce the number of new arrivals. These restrictions look likely to be replicated in many of China's more populous cities.

But the rate of urbanization shows no sign of slowing. So, while existing smaller cities can absorb some of the millions who relocate, China is, with increasing haste, looking to develop entirely new urban areas in order to provide homes, jobs and infrastructure -- all while driving economic growth.

The most high-profile of these is Xiongan, a new city being built across three counties in Hebei province, 100 kilometers to Beijing's south west. Announced to great fanfare in April 2017, it's expected to house up to 2.5 million people . Large-scale construction began in 2019 and, over the next decade, an ambitious government plan will see many of Beijing's businesses, universities and hospitals relocated to this new city, alleviating pressure on the capital and encouraging hi-tech economic development in a traditionally industrial area.

Across the country, China's government is investing trillions of yuan to establish new areas and development zones, many of which act as satellites to existing cities. To the south of Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province, Tianfu New Area has been developed over the last decade and is soon set to open Unicorn Island , a 166-acre technology hub designed by Zaha Hadid Architects. In Changsha, capital of Hunan province, the vast and similarly ambitious Xiangjiang New Area is intended to attract hi-tech industry and is home to the country's first test zone for autonomous public transport.

These projects all look back to one city for inspiration: the godfather of urban transformation and the country's ""model"" city, Shenzhen. Now home to over 13 million people, the southern metropolis is the Chinese government's proudest symbol of the last 40 years of economic reform.

Building on Shenzhen

On September 4, 1984, the sound of firecrackers echoed through the streets of Shenzhen as the city celebrated the completion of the International Trade Center, its -- and, at the time, China's -- tallest building.

Deng Xiaoping, the country's then paramount leader, had visited the site earlier that year and had given the project his seal of approval. He was particularly impressed by the speed of construction, which -- though it began slowly, partly due to a lack of proper equipment -- eventually reached a rate of one new floor every three days. The pace with which the upper floors of the tower were built became known as ""Shenzhen speed,"" part of the pervasive mythology that clouds the origins of this so-called ""Instant City.""

For visitors to Shenzhen in the 1980s, the 50-story skyscraper dominated the city's skyline. Over time, however, neighboring buildings would reach, and then exceed, the International Trade Center. As Juan Du, an architect and author of new book ""The Shenzhen Experiment"" observed in an email interview: ""This cluster of tall buildings became the image of China's post-reform modernization and urbanization.""

Special Economic Zones

As China began reforming its economic system and opening up to the world, a process initiated by Deng in the late 1970s, Shenzhen was established as one of China's first four ""Special Economic Zones,"" or SEZs. All four were chosen for their favorable geographical position and access to global markets, with Shenzhen located just across the river from the international hub of Hong Kong.

An oft-repeated myth is that Shenzhen grew from a fishing village. But in 1980 it was already a bustling market town. The surrounding areas that would become the SEZ covered almost 330 square kilometers and included a number of other pre-existing villages and towns. The official population of the SEZ at the time was 94,100, according to Du's research.

Although Shenzhen is now considered a success story, its establishment and early development was not without controversy. The city was, as Deng acknowledged, an experiment, and thus diverged from rules that applied to the rest of China. Shenzhen was allowed to try out comparatively radical ideas, like loosening price controls on goods and inviting foreign direct investment.

Shenzhen was such an exception that, for much of its existence, it was physically separated from the rest of the country by a barbed wire fence. This fortified perimeter was interspersed with seven manned checkpoints and was known as the ""Second Line"" (the first being the border with the semi-autonomous Hong Kong to the south).

Until 2006, visitors from other parts of China needed their passports and a special permit to enter the SEZ.

When Deng visited in 1984, he asserted that SEZs were ""windows of technology, management, knowledge and foreign policy,"" designed to showcase China's potential to the rest of the world -- and the rest of the country. The city was intended to become a ""national model for China's modernization and urbanization,"" Du said.

Architecture and design became crucial ways of representing this model vision of modern China. The country's urban spaces have long emphasized the importance of symmetry, with streets traditionally laid out in straight lines running east to west and north to south. Following these principles, Shenzhen initially spread out along its first east-west avenue, whilst the city's main Central Business District was laid out along a prominent north to south axis, flanked by skyscrapers and landmark architectural projects.

Shenzhen was not, however, a blank slate onto which a symmetrically ordered city could be drawn. Existing villages within the boundaries of the Special Economic Zone grew exponentially, as they were often the first destinations for the thousands of newcomers looking for an affordable place to live.

Those who owned village properties would quickly extend their houses upwards and outwards to offer low-rent accommodation for new arrivals. ""Without the villages, the city would never have grown with the famous 'Shenzhen speed,'"" Jonathan Bach wrote in ""Learning from Shenzhen,"" a collection of essays on the city. ""The city could never have sustained the cost of housing and supporting so much labor.""

However, over time, the villages have been surrounded and overshadowed by new, more lucrative developments -- or razed by developers seeking new opportunities for growth.

As Du observed in ""The Shenzhen Experiment,"" many people in China share a stereotyped view of the surviving villages as being ""dirty, disorderly and inferior,"" though they have been integral in driving Shenzhen's success, and their vibrancy and dynamism are a key aspect of the city's culture. There are still hundreds of these ""urban villages,"" and one of the unresolved challenges in Shenzhen's development is how to sensitively manage and integrate them -- and the millions of people who live in them -- into an ever-growing metropolis that leaders like to promote as an orderly, model city.

A new city center

Shenzhen has proven such a success that it's now faced with a problem unimaginable to its original planners: A lack of space.

One source of new land has been found by building onto what was once the sea.

Through extensive land reclamation, the waterfront at the city's southern edge was extended into the bay almost 20 years ago. A new city center business district, dubbed Shenzhen Bay Headquarters City, is now being built on that land.

""We intend to make Shenzhen Bay a complementary city center to the string of existing central business districts of Shenzhen,"" said Claude Godefroy of Henning Larsen Architects, one of three firms to win a competition to design the new district, in an email interview.

With the first phase of building expected to be completed by 2022, the project features a north-south axis and showpiece skyscraper (the project's main tower will reach a height of over 1,640 feet, the architects said, placing it firmly in the world's 20 tallest buildings).

But beyond the superlatives, its design aims to correct the mistakes of the past. Although Shenzhen has been treated as a model city, the power of hindsight has exposed some of the original plan's shortcomings.

In a city where ""oversize impassable highways crisscross the city and isolate neighborhoods from each other,"" as Godefroy put it, Shenzhen Bay will be pedestrian friendly. A waterfront promenade will be lined with bars and restaurants, correcting ""an historic failure in Shenzhen's urban planning: its disconnection with the sea,"" he added. ""Citizens complain that they sometimes forget they are living in a coastal city.""

One of the project's goals is to attract skilled Chinese and international workers to the city. ""All megacities compete to attract the talents of tomorrow,"" Godefroy said, ""and Shenzhen lags behind in livability compared to Hong Kong.""

The idea of Shenzhen competing with neighboring Hong Kong, long a prosperous global trading hub, is hardly new. But a government plan published over the summer of 2019 directly declared its ambition for Shenzhen to itself become ""a capital of innovation, entrepreneurship and creativity with international influence.""

The plan emphasizes making the city more internationally open, developing its reputation as a technology hub -- it is already home to Chinese tech giants Huawei, Tencent and ZTE, among others -- and improving its environmental credentials. It is to become a ""pioneering demonstration zone of socialism with Chinese characteristics"" according to the State Council , China's cabinet.

""The State Council document was not part of the brief for Shenzhen Bay, but every architect involved with Shenzhen knows that is the agenda,"" said Godefroy. Although he doesn't believe Shenzhen can become a true competitor to Hong Kong, as ""their economies have such a different focus,"" he said that the government's ambition for the new development was very clear -- it wants to ""make this district the spearhead of a plan to position Shenzhen a model city for China and the world.""

A model for China

China's politicians have persistently tried to replicate the ""Shenzhen effect"" as they develop other urban areas around the country.

These new areas often feature architectural motifs reminiscent of Shenzhen, sprawling along broad, perpendicular avenues flanked by convention centers, malls and flagship skyscrapers. And, like Shenzhen, they are generally built with economic revitalization in mind, with local governments often offering favorable terms to developers and companies relocating there.

Take Shanghai's Pudong district, across the river from the city's famous Bund, which drew inspiration from Shenzhen. In early 1990, Deng, who often wintered in Shanghai, began to encourage China's next generation of leaders to allow Pudong -- relatively rural in comparison to the city it faced across the water -- to redevelop, saying that he had made a mistake by not including Shanghai in the original group of Special Economic Zones in 1979. According to Ezra Vogel's 2011 biography of Deng, the paramount leader argued the city could, at least, benefit from developing later than Shenzhen by learning the lessons of its predecessor.

Pudong has since become home to a famed skyline punctuated by some of China's tallest buildings, and the center of the country's financial sector. The district's planning and development was certainly more centralized and coordinated than that of Shenzhen, but despite innovative plans proposed by international architecture firms, Pudong ended up re-articulating the same ideas of urban development: build quickly and ambitiously, maximize land value and prioritize the commercial over the human.

Beyond Pudong, China has struggled to successfully export Shenzhen's remarkable example. Even the other three SEZs established at the same time as Shenzhen -- Shantou, Xiamen and Zhuhai -- failed to develop in anything like the same explosive manner. A myriad of different factors has influenced this -- geography, size and scale, specific local policies and the nature of the cities' populations. As Du noted in her book, ""Shenzhen ... is not a singular transferable model but a plurality, informed by local conditions and local communities.""

Xiongan, Xi's model city

Beijing's new satellite city, Xiongan, is China's latest attempt to replicate the success of Shenzhen. President Xi Jinping has appointed Shenzhen's former mayor and party chief, Xu Qin, as governor of Hebei province, where the city is being built. State media has referred to Xiongan as the "" Shenzhen of the North "" while, according to its master plan, the project is intended to become ""a model city in the history of human development.""

There are differences between Xiongan's development and that of Shenzhen, however. Most obviously, whereas all of the original Special Economic Zones were coastal areas designed to attract foreign capital, Xiongan is 150 kilometers from the nearest coastline.

It will mainly serve a center for domestic, rather than international, industries -- in particular, many of the country's massive state-owned enterprises currently based in Beijing.

The government also emphasizes that Xiongan will be a green ""smart city,"" built on a more human scale and with lower population density than China's sprawling megacities. The city will be comparatively low-rise, and free from the ever-taller skyscrapers that define most new urban developments. Early work has focused on improving environmental conditions in what is one of the most polluted areas of China, with the sizeable Baiyangdian Lake -- around which the city will be oriented -- subject to an intensive clean-up operation.

As with Shenzhen, Xiongan must also navigate the complexities of managing the area's existing population. When Xiongan was first announced, a rush of real estate trading led the government to freeze property sales.

The government has subsequently restricted speculation further by announcing that housing in Xiongan will be subject to strict state controls -- a substantial change to the policy of Shenzhen, where property development was a key driver of economic growth.

Many of the existing residents have already been relocated and compensated. But with a population of around 1 million people in the area -- and over 500 villages to be redeveloped -- enabling satisfactory outcomes for low-income and often older rural residents remains problematic.

One key similarity between the two cities, however, is in the way Xiongan will be integrated into a greater conglomeration of urban centers. Just as Shenzhen now blends almost imperceptibly into the Pearl River Delta's other cities, such as Guangzhou and Dongguan, so Xiongan will be connected via high-speed rail with Beijing and Tianjin, to its east, to form a 130-million-person megalopolis nicknamed 'Jing-Jin-Ji' (a portmanteau of the names of Beijing, Tianjin and ""Ji,"" an ancient name for Hebei province).

There is clearly no lack of ambition for Xiongan. It is a project that reflects the ambitions and concerns of China's current leadership, with Xi seemingly hoping to emulate Deng's legacy in Shenzhen by very publicly attaching his name to the project. ""General Secretary Xi Jinping has planned for, made decisions on and promoted (Xiongan) in person, devoting painstaking efforts,"" read a 2018 planning document.

The extent to which Xiongan will copy -- or diverge from -- the template established by the model city of Shenzhen remains to be seen. But what is indisputable is that Shenzhen's example, both positive and negative, remains hugely influential in China's urban planning, even four decades after the city was established.",2020-07-14,https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/shenzhen-effect-china-model-city-intl-hnk/index.html
James Griffiths,Graphic novel on the Tiananmen Massacre shows medium's power to capture history,"James Griffiths , CNN Hong Kong Written by

As a young man in Beijing in the 1980s, Lun Zhang felt like he was taking part in a new Chinese enlightenment.

becoming newly available. The country was undergoing paramount leader Deng Xiaoping's "" Reform and Opening Up ,"" and previously sealed-off areas of knowledge, arts, and culture werebecoming newly available.

People who had only years before been living in the stifling, hyper-Maoist orthodoxy of the Cultural Revolution, in which anything foreign or historical was deemed counter-revolutionary, could now listen to Wham!, hold intellectual salons in which people read Jean-Paul Sartre or Sigmund Freud, or even publish their own works, taking aim at previously sacred political targets.

""In those days, our thirst to read, learn and explore the outside world was insatiable,"" Zhang writes in his new graphic novel, ""Tiananmen 1989: Our Shattered Hopes.""

But with this intellectual awakening came a growing frustration with the pace of reform in China, particularly how economic liberalization was taking precedence over any suggestion that the Communist Party give up its tight control on the country's politics.

An apocryphal quote attributed to Deng captured the mood at this time, that ""to get rich is glorious,"" but for many people, it was increasingly apparent that only a handful were becoming wealthy, while others were suffering due to growing corruption and the destruction of the social safety net.

Small demonstrations against graft and for greater political reform ballooned into what would become the 1989 Tiananmen movement , in which hundreds of thousands of people protested across the country, with the largest demonstration in Beijing led by workers and student groups.

The pro-democracy protesters occupied Tiananmen Square for months, even holding meetings with top officials. At the time, many felt hopeful that these actions would bring about wider societal change in the one-party state.

Crackdown

Zhang was on the square that spring, when the protesters put forward seven demands, including for democratic elections and an end to state censorship. He was there as the crowds paid tribute to the late reformist leader Hu Yaobang, and he was there as the occupiers sang and danced on what had become the people's square.

He was not there when soldiers opened fire on protesters and fought with them in the streets of the Chinese capital. He was not there when the tanks rolled in. Zhang was in the suburbs of the city with another activist, recuperating in preparation for what some thought would be a last push before the government gave into the protesters' demands.

""When we heard the army had entered Beijing, we tried to reach the square, but our efforts were in vain,"" Zhang writes of when they learned of the bloodshed.

Far from reaching the center of the city, Zhang's attention turned to escape: the authorities were rounding up prominent protesters and leaders, and he was worried about arrest. He fled first to rural China, eventually becoming one of dozens of Tiananmen protesters smuggled into Hong Kong by activists in the then British colony.

Graphic novel

Zhang eventually moved to France, where he has lived ever since, and is teaching at the Cergy-Pontoise University near Paris. While he writes about the Chinese economy and geopolitics, he has largely left out his own personal history prior to this month's publication of his graphic novel.

""I worked with (French journalist) Adrien Gombeaud, who wrote the script for the format,"" Zhang told CNN. ""We read some graphic novels about historical events, and together came up with the plan, for example, to imagine a theater scene to link all the parts of the story.""

While the Tiananmen Square Massacre has been widely covered in the media and in documentaries, with many focusing on the iconic image of the Tank Man or utilizing archive footage from the square itself, much of the events leading up to the infamous night have been lost to history, available only through witnesses' accounts. Zhang said that the comics format provided a key means of capturing the emotion of the demonstrations, in a way that does not necessarily come across in text.

""It is difficult to find a satisfactory way in which this kind of big event is reported, in my opinion,"" he said. ""In some reporting on Tiananmen, the authors didn't reflect enough on the will of students to cooperate with the authorities in peacefully reforming China.

""When you take into account the emotion involved, we can understand why the peaceful way of demonstration was chosen, why there was the huge hunger strike.""

After the initial script was written, the authors worked with French artist Ameziane to develop the comic's visuals, by sourcing images of the various characters, and referencing archival photos of era-appropriate objects, such as clothes, cars and teacups from 1980s China. ""We spent a lot of time in discussions on how to arrange the scenes, how to convey the essential message, what limits we might have on a given page. It played to the style and skill of our painter,"" Zhang said.

The shift in artistic style is most notable in the scenes depicting the massacre itself. Prior pages feature white backgrounds and muted colors, but as the crackdown begins, the pages turn to black, with a heavy use of oranges and reds. Ameziane's illustrations become looser and full of movement, emphasizing the chaos and panic experienced by the characters.

The book is structured in several acts, with Zhang as its narrator. He said the play format was an obvious storytelling device, given ""the protest movement itself felt like a drama, with its different phases akin to great acts.""

Comics journalism

Zhang, Gombeaud and Ameziane's book joins what has quietly become a major strand of modern comics: graphic journalism or historical comics dealing with topics that were once considered out of the art form's remit.

American cartoonist Art Spiegelman's ""Maus,"" a Pulitzer Prize-winning account of his parents' experiences as Holocaust survivors -- with the Jews depicted as mice and the Nazis as cats -- has long been considered a masterwork in the graphic novel genre.

While adult themes and history were features in comics long before ""Maus"" debuted in 1980, including in Spiegelman's own work, its use of accessible, black and white art combined with a sweeping historical narrative broke into the mainstream, and set a new standard for ""grown up"" comics with political subject matter and potentially upsetting content.

Works like Maltese-American Joe Sacco's ground-breaking comics journalism in ""Palestine"" or ""Safe Area Gorazde,"" and French-Iranian Marjane Satrapi's ""Persepolis"" have further driven this trend, with the latter turned into an Oscar-nominated movie in 2007.

The popularity of comics and graphic novels has only grown in recent years -- with the help of blockbuster film adaptations. This has happened in conjunction with the rise of comics journalism, in everything from newspapers to dedicated publications such as The Nib , which has long recognized the medium's ability to tackle serious issues, interweaving reporting with satirical cartoons.

Sacco has talked about how the use of comics, the presentation of the artist and writer as a figure in the story, helps remove ""the illusion that a journalist is a fly on the wall, all seeing and all knowing.""

in a ""To me, drawing myself signals to the reader that I'm a filter between the information, the people and them. They know that I'm a presence, and that they're seeing things through my eyes,"" he saidin a recent interview

This is very much apparent in Zhang's book, as he uses his role as narrator to critique both the protest movement and himself.

Asked once about whether drawing helped him deal with being the child of Holocaust survivors, Spiegelman answered : ""I've had therapy, and I've made comics. The comics are cheaper.""

Part of ""Maus"" deals with Spiegelman's guilt over his difficult relationship with his father and in comparing his problems with depression and work to the experiences of his parents. Zhang too writes in ""Tiananmen"" of his own survivor's guilt and of questioning his decisions made as a younger man in the midst of history.

In an interview, Zhang said he did not write about Tiananmen for so long, because his role, his involvement, seemed inconsequential compared to what some went through.

""The way I saw it, there were many people dead or wounded in the aftermath, and many people lost their jobs; their families were never the same after,"" he said. ""The real heroes were the ordinary students and people in (Beijing) and other cities. By comparison, what I did personally didn't seem worth telling. The most important thing I could do was live my life in a way that wouldn't dishonor the dead.""

He was eventually convinced by an editor to write the book last year, around the 30th anniversary of the massacre. ""She convinced me that I had a duty to the memory of that time,"" Zhang said. ""I accepted it. 'No justice, no peace,' but I think also, 'No memory, no justice.'""",2020-07-14,https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/tiananmen-square-massacre-graphic-novel-comics-journalism-intl-hnk/index.html
Jacopo Prisco,Tetris: The Soviet 'mind game' that took over the world,"Jacopo Prisco , CNN Written by

Read more unknown and curious design origin stories here

Like many of history's greatest ideas, Tetris came about quite unintentionally.

Alexey Pajitnov was a software engineer at the Soviet Academy of Sciences in Moscow, tasked with testing a new type of computer, the Electronika 60. To do so, he wrote a simple game based on a puzzle from his childhood. It would help assess how powerful the computer was -- and provide a bit of fun.

Little did he know that the resulting game would go on to become one of the greatest, most addictive and most successful of all time.

It was June 6, 1984, and Tetris had just started its journey from behind the Iron Curtain.

The original version of Tetris.

Tetris is a puzzle game in which geometric shapes called ""tetrominoes"" fall down onto a playing field, and the player has to arrange them to form gapless lines. Pajitnov took inspiration from pentomino, a classic puzzle game consisting of all the different shapes that can be made by combining five squares -- 12 in total -- with the goal of arranging them in a wooden box like a jigsaw puzzle.

To simplify things, he knocked that down to four squares, thus reducing the number of shapes from 12 to seven. He called the game Tetris, combining the Greek numeral ""tetra"" (meaning four) and tennis, his favorite sport.

Pajitnov himself was immediately hooked. ""I couldn't stop myself from playing this prototype version, because it was very addictive to put the shapes together,"" he said on the phone from Seattle, where he now lives.

But creating a video game in Soviet Russia at the height of the Cold War was far from easy. It was only through the sheer brilliance of its design that Tetris was transformed from a quirky test program into a worldwide phenomenon.

Word of mouth

Although Tetris became immediately popular among programmers with access to an Electronika 60, the machine had no graphical capabilities -- and less memory than today's calculators. Pressed with requests to create a version of the game for the IBM PC, a more widespread computer with better graphics, Pajitnov assigned the job to Vadim Gerasimov, a 16-year-old student on a summer job at his office (today an engineer at Google). The game spread quickly. ""It was like a wood fire. Everyone in the Soviet Union who had a PC had Tetris on it,"" said Pajitnov.

Pajitnov wasn't making any money off the game, nor did he intend to. Ideas were owned by the state and the very concept of selling software as a product was unfamiliar to him. People were just sharing Tetris through word of mouth and by copying it onto floppy disks.

Then, Pajitnov heard rumors that the game might have crossed borders and was being played in other Eastern bloc countries. In 1986, he got a message via telex -- a forerunner of the fax machine -- from Robert Stein, a salesman for a Hungary-based software company called Andromeda. Stein, who had seen Tetris in Hungary, wanted to secure the rights to sell it as a computer game in the West. He offered significant money in advance.

""My English was really bad at that time, so I put together some kind of positive answer, saying we were very glad to receive the proposal and that some agreement could be made,"" said Pajitnov. He knew that doing business directly with a Western firm could have landed him in jail, even before making any money, so he started investigating how he could sell the rights to Tetris through the state.

Stein, however, interpreted his response as a green light and immediately started producing the game. But as he was preparing to launch, he received another telex from Elorg -- short for Electronorgtechnica, the Soviet organization that oversaw software and hardware exports. It said that the rights had not been officially granted and that his launch was illegal.

Eventually, Stein cleared the rights, and Tetris was released as a commercial PC title in the UK and the US in 1988. The game played up its Soviet origins through Kremlin-themed illustrations and Cyrillic characters. But the misunderstanding between Pajitnov and Stein showed how tricky it would be to export a video game from Soviet Russia to the West for the first time -- an issue that led to years of confusion and legal battles, and is even rumored to have landed on the desk of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.

The Game Boy

Tetris was selling well on computers, but the big money in the games sector was being made elsewhere: consoles. Henk Rogers, a Dutch video game developer and businessman living in Japan, was the first to realize that Tetris was a perfect match for the Game Boy, a new handheld system released by Nintendo in Japan in early 1989. The console was about to launch in North America and Europe too, and Rogers set out to convince the company to bundle a copy of the game in the box, a common practice outside of Japan.

""I made a handshake deal with Minoru Arakawa, the founder of Nintendo of America, to have Nintendo include Tetris in every Game Boy,"" said Rogers in a phone interview. ""He said, 'Why should I include Tetris? I have Mario.' And I said, 'If you want little boys to buy your Game Boy, then include Mario. But if you want everyone to buy your Game Boy, then you should include Tetris.'""

Rogers set out to obtain the necessary permissions, and soon realized what a challenge that would be. He had already published a version of Tetris in Japan, for the popular Nintendo Famicom home system, only to discover that there were half a dozen companies all claiming to own the rights to the game. ""So I got on a plane and went to Moscow on a tourist visa to track down the source of the rights, Elorg -- and talk my way into it,"" he said.

Once in Moscow, Rogers made little progress until he hired an interpreter, who swiftly took him to Elorg.

""She knew immediately where everything was, so that was fishy. They're not supposed to talk to foreigners, and I wasn't supposed to talk to the Russians, let alone people inside the government. So I broke all kinds of rules by being there. They interrogated me for two hours. I thought they were trying to figure out whether they were gonna send me to Siberia or not,"" he said.

But among the officials in the room was Alexey Pajitnov, who immediately took a liking to Rogers. ""Alexey was the only guy in the room who actually knew anything about games,"" Rogers recalled. ""I explained how business worked, and we became friends. A week later, I left Moscow with a signed agreement for Tetris on the Game Boy.""

The Game Boy version of Tetris sold 35 million units and helped the console become one of the most successful of all time. It is still considered by many -- Pajitnov included -- to be the best version of Tetris, and it created an unprecedented synergy between hardware and software, epitomizing the gaming mantra ""easy to learn, hard to master.""

Delayed royalties

Despite the game's success, Pajitnov was still not making any money from it. ""There was a lot of legal trouble, and when the question of ownership and the original source of the game came up, I decided that I wanted everything to go smoothly and I granted the rights to the Computer Center of the Soviet Academy of Sciences for 10 years,"" he said.

The legal trouble culminated in a skirmish between Nintendo and Atari over the home console rights for Tetris. A judge ruled in Nintendo's favor in late 1989, dealing a lethal blow to Atari, which had already produced hundreds of thousands of now useless copies of its version of the game, under the tagline ""Tetris: The Soviet Mind Game."" Nintendo took a different approach, opting for the slogan ""From Russia with fun.""

Pajitnov left Moscow for Seattle in 1991, with the help of his friend Henk Rogers. And when his deal over the rights expired in 1995, he finally started receiving royalties for the game. ""And they've been fine so far,"" he said.

Pajitnov and Rogers in 2018.

In 1996, Pajitnov and Rogers founded the Tetris Company, to handle licensing for Tetris and its spinoffs. In 2005, the Tetris Company bought Elorg -- which after the fall of the Soviet Union had transformed from a state-owned company into a private one -- gaining total control of all Tetris rights worldwide. The company has even standardized and trademarked the names and colors of every Tetris piece -- officially called Tetriminos , rather than the generic tetrominoes, although they have many unofficial nicknames

Tetris has been the subject of several scientific studies. One found that playing the game can be effective in fighting off cravings for food and even drugs, while another noted an increase in the thickness of some parts of the brain in people who had played regularly. Playing Tetris for prolonged periods of time can lead to players dreaming to about the falling pieces or interpreting real-world objects as tetrominoes and mentally re-arranging them -- a phenomenon known as ""the Tetris Effect.""

To date, Tetris has been released on over 65 platforms, a world record , with more than half a billion downloads on mobile devices, according to the Tetris Company. Pajitnov has personally worked on over 100 variants of the game.

The latest, released in early 2019 to coincide with the game's 35th anniversary, is an online multiplayer version called ""Tetris 99,"" which can be played by up to 99 players simultaneously. Since 2010, an eSports tournament based on the 1989 Nintendo Entertainment System version of Tetris has seen the world's best players gather in Portland, Oregon. Some of the matches, which can surpass 30 minutes in length, have garnered over 10 million views on YouTube.

""It hasn't lost any of its play value and nothing has come to replace Tetris,"" said Henk Rogers, explaining the game's enduring popularity.

""It's like 'Happy Birthday.' There have been lots of songs that come and go, but 'Happy Birthday' is it still always sung in the same way. Tetris has become the 'Happy Birthday' of computer games.""",2020-07-14,https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/tetris-video-game-history/index.html
Eliza Mackintosh,"Amid the pandemic, a group of asylum seekers was moved to a small, rural Irish town. Then they started testing positive for Covid-19","(CNN) Misha was living in a hotel in a leafy suburb of Ireland's capital city under the country's controversial asylum seeker accommodation system when a letter arrived.

She had been waiting months for a decision to be made on her asylum status. But the letter wasn't about that.

Misha, and dozens of other asylum seekers at the Dublin hotel were notified that they would be moved to a rural town over 200 miles away, on the west coast of Ireland, due to concerns over Covid-19 spreading through the accommodation, which was also shared by paying guests. She had less than 24 hours to pack her things.

When she was transferred to the Skellig Star accommodation center in Cahersiveen, County Kerry, on March 18, she was hopeful it would be safe. But, after arriving and being told to bunk with another asylum seeker she didn't know, she began to fear the worst.

""I was scared for my life,"" said Misha, who asked that her real name not be used for fear it might impact her asylum claim.

About 100 people in total were transferred from a handful of centers, including from one Dublin hotel where a guest from Italy had reportedly contracted the virus.

Just days after they arrived, one of the residents started showing symptoms, according to three people CNN talked to. Then the rumors started.

""I was scared for my life."" Misha

The Cahersiveen community had been given just as little time to prepare; locals found out only a few days before that the Skellig Star — rebuilt in 2006 on the promise of drawing tourists with a swimming pool and other leisure facilities — was being converted into accommodation for asylum seekers.

Despite their lack of consultation and concerns over losing business from the only major hotel in town, people in Cahersiveen welcomed the group, bringing them clothes and toys. But when news began swirling that asylum seekers were getting sick, and still shopping in the local stores, people in the small town began to panic.

""Rural Ireland would love to have these people living in the community ... they'd be more than welcome,"" said Jack Fitzpatrick, chairman of the Cahersiveen Community and Business Alliance. ""But, this is not the way to do it, to plunk 100 people into a very congested hotel in the midst of a pandemic.""

The outbreak, which swiftly spread through the hotel, infecting 25 people at its peak, was declared over on May 20 by Ireland's Health Service Executive (HSE), but local residents and asylum seekers are continuing to push for the center to be shut down, joining together as a united front in a series of demonstrations.

Asylum seekers at the Skellig Star hold a banner protesting the handling of the Covid-19 outbreak on May 7.

Under a system known as Direct Provision, overseen by Ireland's Department of Justice and Equality and operated by private businesses on lucrative contracts , asylum seekers are housed in emergency accommodation while they wait to find out if they will be granted refugee status and permission to stay in the country.

Calls for reform of the system, introduced initially as an emergency measure by the state in 1999 after a sudden increase in asylum applications, have coincided with sweeping, global protests for racial justice following the killing of George Floyd in the US.

Asylum seekers — many of whom are from African countries — have condemned Direct Provision for ""institutionalized racism"" on the part of the government, arguing that no one else in the country is treated in the same way as they are.

While their appeal is being assessed, they're provided with free accommodation, food and utilities, and have access to healthcare and education, but they have almost no autonomy and cannot choose where they live. And they are unable to apply for a work permit until at least eight months into their application process — expected to survive on a weekly allowance of €38.80 ($43) instead.

Commenting on the comparison between Direct Provision and the murder of George Floyd earlier this month, Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar conceded that while some Direct Provision accommodation was substandard and needed to change, it ""ultimately is a service offered by the state ... involves people being provided with free accommodation, food, heat, lighting, health care, education, and also some spending money.""

""It's not the same thing as a man being killed by the police.""

Decisions on asylum cases in Ireland can take years, a fact that has been criticized by the United Nations Refugee Agency , which recently called for the process to be sped up. And rejection rates are high — around 70%, according to recent figures . Dozens of people have died waiting, according to a Freedom of Information request from The Irish Catholic

Not fit for purpose

Ireland's Fianna Fail , Fine Gael and Green Party struck a draft deal to form a new coalition government on Monday, which, if ratified by the members of the three parties, will end months of political stalemate since the country's election in February. It will also inject urgency into reforming the Irish asylum system. One of the key commitments outlined in the agreement is a pledge to end Direct Provision and replace it with an accommodation policy centered on a not-for-profit approach.

Liam Thornton, a law lecturer and Direct Provision expert, greeted the decision with cautious optimism. ""After 20-plus years of government denial that anything much was wrong, it's interesting to see,"" he told CNN. ""While we haven't been here before, it is implementation that will be key.""

Thornton tweeted : ""Direct Provision is one of the darkest chapters in the Dept of Justice history. But it takes people to design, administer, implement such awfulness. New mindsets needed ASAP.""

Asylum seekers, human rights campaigners and legal experts such as Thornton say the pandemic has shone a spotlight on structural problems that have long existed in Ireland's asylum system. Against the backdrop of Covid-19, the often crowded, poor conditions have become that much more apparent.

""HSE has been advising us, and everybody, on social distancing, but you cannot social distance where there is no space,"" Misha said.

""We were sharing bedrooms with strangers. We were sharing the dining room. We were sharing the salt shakers. We were sharing the lobby. We were sharing everything. And if you looked at the whole situation, you cannot really say that it was fit for purpose.""

Skellig Star residents, locked inside the center during quarantine, chant ""move us out"" on April 29.

Misha says she watched in horror as people started falling sick around her, before being pulled into makeshift isolation rooms. The first suspected case of Covid-19 in the center was reported as early as March 24, the Justice Department has conceded, adding that the person did not test positive. They did not say when the test was conducted.

According to asylum seekers and a previous manager, testing of asylum seekers didn't start until weeks later in mid-April. After positive cases were confirmed, all residents at the Skellig Star were ordered to stay inside and quarantine.

""I have verifiable evidence of a written communication from the Skellig Star to the Department of Justice and Equality on 24 March confirming a suspected case of Covid-19. The resident concerned was placed in isolation on 20 March, one day after arrival in Cahersiveen,"" Member of Parliament for Kerry, Norma Foley, said in a special parliamentary committee hearing on the government's Covid-19 response.

""The timeline might not be of importance to either the HSE or the Department of Justice and Equality but it is very important to the residents of the Skellig Star and the community of Cahersiveen. This timeline confirms unequivocally that Covid-19 was transported by bus on 18 March and 19 March to the Skellig Star and the community of Cahersiveen.""

In a statement to CNN regarding the timeline, the Department said it had made an ""honest mistake"" in failing to receive the March 24 communication and that ""there was no attempt by the Department ... to intentionally mislead or conceal the facts"" related to the outbreak.

""Our biggest fear is a second wave ... We're afraid it will spread like wildfire in the hotel again, but next time it may also go through the community."" Jack Fitzpatrick

After her roommate tested positive and was taken away to self-isolate at another center, Misha thought that someone would move her, so that the room could be disinfected. When no one came, she said she raised her concerns with an HSE worker on site, who told her there was no reason to worry.

""It was an embarrassment to my intelligence,"" Misha said. She tested positive 10 days later.

Ireland's Justice Department told CNN that an HSE Development Worker was at the hotel to monitor the health of residents and staff throughout the outbreak, and is now providing more general support, including accessing mainstream health services and integrating in the local community.

The Department said it was continuing to work closely with the HSE and Cahersiveen center managers to ensure the wellbeing of all residents and staff, including offering all single residents their own bedrooms and providing enhanced cleaning services. The center also intends to provide self-catering facilities so that residents can cook in their rooms, instead of eating together in a communal dining room.

Townbe, the company that operates Skellig and three other Direct Provision centers, did not respond to CNN's request for comment. The Justice Department said it was unable to comment on the value of the contract with Townbe until after two years, because of commercial sensitivity.

But the conditions detailed by the Justice Department differ dramatically with what was described to CNN by two asylum seekers and one previous manager at the center.

Fears of second outbreak

When Misha and the other asylum seekers arrived at the Skellig Star in mid-March, they said they found a holiday hotel that was not ready for guests, or prepared to cope with the coronavirus. The central heating was broken, the bedrooms — which were smaller than standard size — were not deep cleaned, isolation rooms had not been established, personal protective equipment was not made available and staff had not been vetted by An Garda Síochána, Ireland's national police service.

Bulelani Mfaco, an activist who has been living in Direct Provision since 2017, detailed some of these conditions in a report for the Movement of Asylum Seekers in Ireland (MASI) , laying out recommendations for wide-ranging reforms of the system. Top of his list: Guaranteeing a suitable standard of living that protects the physical and mental health.

Skellig Star residents in quarantine wave to locals protesting outside on May 7.

""Cahersiveen demonstrates to us that the model doesn't work,"" Mfaco said. ""Giving vulnerable people to hoteliers, who have no training. No thought was given to the risk of gathering all these people, cramming them into a bus and bringing them to a remote village far from any healthcare services.""

Jack Fitzpatrick and other locals are fearful that those healthcare services will be overstretched if another outbreak hits.

The closest major hospital to Cahersiveen, which has a population of around 1,000, is 40 miles away. There are only two doctors in Cahersiveen, and one ambulance serves the entire remote Iveragh Peninsula, where the town is situated.

""We were very lucky that nobody died in the hotel, and that we managed to stop the virus going widespread in the community,"" said Fitzpatrick.

""Our biggest fear is a second wave ... We're afraid it will spread like wildfire in the hotel again, but next time it may also go through the community. So we are basically doing our best to try to get them to close it down and move the people to sort accommodation.""

People in the town are demanding the resignation of Justice Minister Charlie Flanagan, who they say misled the public over the Covid-19 outbreak at the Skellig Star.

""We should be given, at least, the status of permission to remain so we can have our own-door accommodation, cook our own meals and keep ourselves and our families safe from the virus."" Azwar Fuard

Flanagan has apologized to the people of Cahersiveen , but said his department had no knowledge of the infection in the Dublin hotel before transferring asylum seekers from it.

In the wake of the outbreak, Flanagan has asked the former Secretary General to undertake a review of the Department's response to Covid-19 in direct provision centers like Cahersiveen.

Ciaran Quinlan, of Cahersiveen, told CNN he is seeking an injunction to close the center. He says he wants ""to help these people to get their own front-door accommodation, and to move them out of the unsuitable accommodation that they're in.""

Azwar Fuard, an asylum seeker who has been acting as a spokesman for the 70 residents remaining at the center, is calling on Flanagan to grant the Skellig Star residents amnesty to remain in Ireland.

Fuard, originally from Sri Lanka, was moved from the same hotel as Misha in Dublin with his young family just as they were starting to feel settled. Both Fuard and his wife had found work in the capital, made friends, and their three-year-old daughter had started going to pre-school. To be ripped away from yet another life, he said, was like a double trauma.

Now he says the family of three is largely confined to a 12ft x 13ft room, with an ensuite bathroom and no cooking or washing facilities.

""We should be given, at least, the status of permission to remain so we can have our own-door accommodation, cook our own meals and keep ourselves and our families safe from the virus,"" Fuard said.",2020-06-16,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/16/europe/ireland-asylum-direct-provision-coronavirus-intl/index.html

(CNN) From Hong Kong to California, cities and states around the world are reimposing restrictions to contain resurgent coronavirus outbreaks, as the number of global infections surpasses 13 million and the World Health Organization warns there are ""no shortcuts"" out of the pandemic.

That includes a vaccine.

While experts hope there will be an effective inoculation against Covid-19 by early 2021, a new study suggests that immunity could be lost within months , and that the virus may reinfect people year after year, like the common cold. Whether the world finds a cure or not, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has urged the use of tools available now to suppress transmission and save lives.

""We need to reach a sustainable situation where we do have adequate control of this virus without shutting down our lives entirely or lurching from lockdown to lockdown,"" Ghebreyesus said Monday.

But that is exactly what governments are being forced to do, as the pandemic continues to spiral out of control.

In the US, California Governor Gavin Newsom announced one of the most sweeping rollbacks of any state's reopening plans, ordering all bars closed and restaurants, movie theaters, museums, zoos and card rooms to cease indoor operations, as cases surge. ""It's incumbent on all of us to recognize, soberly, that Covid-19 is not going away anytime soon,"" Newsom said.

In the Philippines, a quarter of a million people in the capital of Manila will go back into lockdown as the virus spikes and hospitals reach capacity. ""I am not sure if this is a solution, but I am certain that if I do this the number of cases will not increase,"" Navotas city mayor Toby Tiangco told a local radio station, Agence France-Presse reported.

But that lockdown logic -- all or nothing -- is becoming harder to rationalize as the pandemic picks up pace: The tally of cases worldwide has jumped by a million in just five days.

YOU ASKED. WE ANSWERED

Q: How long does Covid-19 immunity last?

A: , according to new research that suggests the coronavirus could reinfect people annually, like the common cold. People who were infected with Covid-19 may lose their immunity within months , according to new research that suggests the coronavirus could reinfect people annually, like the common cold.

In the first study of its kind, scientists analyzed the immune responses of more than 90 people -- 65 patients and 31 health care workers -- for three months after they first started showing Covid-19 symptoms, and found that antibodies that can destroy the virus started to decline after about three weeks.

""Vaccines in development will either need to generate stronger and longer lasting protection compared to natural infection, or they may need to be given regularly,"" Dr. Stephen Griffins, associate professor in the University of Leeds School of Medicine, who was not involved in the new study, said.

Limitations of the study: The study has not been peer-reviewed. More research is needed to determine whether similar results would emerge among a larger group of patients, and to continue measuring antibody responses over a longer period of time.

WHAT'S IMPORTANT TODAY

Some of America's biggest school districts won't open as Trump wants them to

Los Angeles and San Diego schools will forgo any type of in-person instruction when the academic year resumes, the districts said on Monday, in the latest signal that administrators are loath to risk the health of children or teachers until the pandemic is under control.

The move follows a decision by New York City -- the largest school district in the country -- to stagger in-person learning, with Mayor Bill de Blasio announcing last week that the city would offer physical classroom instruction one to three days a week, supplemented by online education the rest of the time.

How the coronavirus is shaping health care politics in 2020

The current outbreak is now concentrated in states with the highest share of uninsured residents in the nation like Texas, Florida and Georgia, where Republican governors, legislators or both have refused to expand eligibility for Medicaid under law. That is complicating the local response and amplifying the political debate over the future of the Affordable Care Act, Ronald Brownstein writes

America is running out of protective gear -- again

Nearly four months after invoking a 1950s-era law in order to compel businesses to manufacture equipment for the fight against the coronavirus, the Trump administration has made only sparing use of its authorities , leaving frontline workers in dire need of supplies like masks, gowns and gloves.

The Department of Health and Human Services listed 19 companies that have received contracts under the Defense Production Act to produce emergency supplies, including 600 million N95 respirators and face masks. But experts say it's not enough and that the effort started far too late.

Only about half the masks ordered will be delivered by the end of this year.

Prepare now for a winter Covid-19 peak

The move comes after experts warned that a second wave of the virus had the potential to kill 120,000 people in the United Kingdom between this September and next June. That's more than double the 45,000 official deaths that Britain has experienced so far.

The estimate by the Academy of Medical Sciences in the UK is based on a ""reasonable worst-case scenario,"" in which the pandemic peaks this winter, as more people stay indoors in poorly ventilated spaces and health care systems are overburdened treating other diseases, like the flu.

16 and stuck in solitary confinement 23 hours a day due to Covid-19

John spent his 16th birthday the same way he's spent every day during the UK's Covid-19 lockdown — alone in a cell for 23 hours, with no visits, no internet and few phone calls. He is one of hundreds of children locked up in UK prisons, the forgotten casualties of Covid-19

In the UK, teens and children aged 18 and younger are held in what the government refers to as secure children's homes, secure training centers and young offender institutions. The lawyers CNN spoke to universally refer to such institutions as prisons.

The new restrictions have been imposed by the UK government as part of the Covid-19 lockdown. Visits have been temporarily suspended and time outside of prison cells has been severely reduced, as part of broader measures to enforce social distancing in prisons due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

TOP TIPS

1. Wake up. 2. Make coffee.

As the days blend together for many people living in lockdown, crossing things off a to-do list can feel both harder to do, and more satisfying. While life may feel more daunting than ever, keeping a checklist can be helpful for decreasing anxiety, providing structure and giving us a sense of purpose.

Research on the psychology of goal-making has revealed that an unfinished goal causes interference with other tasks you're trying to achieve. But simply making a plan to facilitate that goal, such as detailing steps on a to-do list, can help your mind set it aside to focus on other things.

Check out these tips on reframing your checklist as a set of miniature goals, and how to complete them.

Mary Ilyushina,Protests erupt in Russia's Far East after arrest of governor over years-old murders,"Moscow (CNN) Thousands of Russians protested on the streets in the country's remote Far Eastern territory of Khabarovsk on Saturday after their governor was arrested and flown to Moscow on charges for years-old murders, in a detention criticized as a politically motivated move by President Vladimir Putin's government.

Live feeds of the protests posted to social media from the event showed people chanting: ""This is our land"" and ""Putin must resign,"" while demanding Khabarovsk Governor Sergey Furgal be released and brought back to the territory.

State-run media TASS reported on Thursday that Furgal had been arrested, while a video posted to YouTube by the Russian state's Investigative Committee showed the governor being pulled from his vehicle by masked officers in fatigues, who then pat him down and put him in a van before driving away.

Khabarovsk Governor Sergey Furgal is escorted into a police van after a court hearing in Moscow on Friday.

The arrest comes less than two weeks after the country gave Putin the green light to serve beyond his existing term limits, in a referendum on constitutional reforms that could now see the leader cement his power until 2036.

Furgal on Friday appeared in court in Moscow, charged with orchestrating the murders of two businessmen in 2004 and 2005 and the attempted murder of another, according to an unnamed law enforcement quoted by TASS. Furgal denied all charges. The court ordered him detained until September 9. Four other people were arrested in November in connection to the alleged murders and later testified against Furgal, according to TASS.

Laura Smith-Spark,Trump ally battles a liberal challenger. Poland's deep divisions on show in presidential run-off vote,"Szczecin, Poland (CNN) Poland is a country deeply divided over cultural issues, and the direction the former Soviet bloc nation should take next: does it want to be a European-style liberal democracy, or does it take a more authoritarian path?

The government's erosion of gay rights has put it on a collision course with Europe, as have its radical reforms to the courts. These changes are viewed by other European Union leaders as having politicized the judiciary and undermined the rule of law.

Now the country will go to the polls Sunday for a second-round vote in what could be the country's most consequential presidential election in decades. The outcome could shape Poland's future direction within the European Union and reverberate well beyond its borders.

The battle between the remaining candidates -- populist incumbent Andrzej Duda, backed by the ruling Law and Justice party (PiS), and his more liberal challenger, Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski, of the center-right Civic Platform party -- has become increasingly contentious.

US President Donald Trump walks with his Polish counterpart Andrzej Duda before a press conference at the White House last month.

President Duda came out on top in the first round on June 28 with 43.5% of the ballots cast, according to the National Electoral Commission, while Trzaskowski, who entered the race only a few weeks ago, took about 30.5% of the vote. Turnout was high, at over 64%.

But observers predict a much closer second round, as the pair fight to pass the vital 50% threshold by winning over voters who backed candidates now out of the race.

During campaigning, Duda -- who met with US President Donald Trump at the White House last month -- has sought to mobilize his more conservative, largely rural base with appeals to traditional Catholic values and a promise to maintain popular social welfare policies, such as a child allowance and lower pension age.

as an ""ideology"" worse than Soviet-era communism sparked wide criticism, prompting Duda to But comments in which he described LGBTQ rightsas an ""ideology"" worse than Soviet-era communism sparked wide criticism, prompting Duda to tweet that his words had been ""put out of context"" as part of a dirty political fight.

""I truly believe in diversity and equality,"" he said, before adding: ""At the same time, beliefs of any minority cannot be imposed on a majority under the false pretense of tolerance.""

Presidential candidate Rafal Trzaskowski delivers a speech to locals and supporters during a campaign rally on July 7 in Gniezno, Poland.

Trzaskowski, who has previously served as an opposition minister and member of the European Parliament in Brussels, told CNN the election was important because ""the current government is monopolizing all the power"" and attacking key institutions.

""We need a break, we need a balance of power where the president of the Republic can cooperate with the government as needed -- for instance, when it comes to restoring good relations with the European Union -- but who is ready to veto legislation, for instance, that meddles with the rule of law,"" he said Wednesday in Szczecin, northwest Poland, where he was holding a campaign rally.

The government wants to focus debate solely on the LGBTQ issue, Trzaskowski said. As mayor of Warsaw, he said, ""I was always standing next to those who are marginalized. Disabled people, people of minorities, people are sent to the margins of society by this government.""

And if reelected, Duda is likely to continue to rubber-stamp the agenda shaped by PiS leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski, Piotr Buras, head of the Warsaw office of the European Council on Foreign Relations, told CNN.

Basic rights

LGBTQ protesters rallied in the capital, Warsaw, on Thursday against Duda's position on gay rights.

Just on Monday, Duda signed a draft amendment to the Constitution which, if approved, would bar the adoption of a child by a same-sex couple, saying his goal was to ""support the Polish family, protect Polish children.""

Trzaskowski also said in recent days that he's against the adoption of children by same-sex couples but has previously committed to supporting LGBTQ rights.

Trzaskowski supporter Jakub Lipczinsky, who attended the rally Wednesday in Szczecin, told CNN he was ""deeply concerned about what's happening with our basic rights"" at the hands of the current government.

""I have to say that I have never seen such a reckless attitude against our beliefs, our values,"" he said. ""And it is with such an arrogance. And so it is of utmost importance for us to stop this process of breaking law. If our candidate won the election, it would be a great step toward the improvement of this political situation in our country.""

Lipczinsky said he believed in respecting other people's views on their sexuality and their right to express themselves freely. ""Once your basic right to express yourself and your sexuality is broken it is difficult to still speak of a democracy,"" he said.

Another Trzaskowski supporter, Hannah Nikolaiczyk, told CNN the politician represented change that was much needed.

""It is important that Poland is not closed and separated from other countries,"" she said. ""It is important to work with them. It's important to see the change that is about to happen and I hope that Poles see that as well.""

Nikolaiczyk said she was motivated by concerns over LGBT rights and the constitution, but also issues such as health care and its approach to Europe. ""I think it is important to be open instead of closing and doing everything against connections with other countries,"" she said.

Andrzej Krasnitzky, also at the rally, described Duda as ""like a puppet on a string in the hands of Kaczynski"" and said he feared that after another five years with him in power ""our democracy will completely be destroyed.""

President Andrzej Duda delivers a speech during a campaign rally on July 4 in Wroclaw, Poland.

Others disagree, saying Duda and the ruling coalition are carrying out much-needed reforms.

Jakub, a 48-year-old Duda supporter in Warsaw who declined to give CNN his last name, said: ""I vote for Duda because I want to ensure continuity of government so that the current government can continue reforms. This government has evened out the social divide in Poland and President Duda is necessary, so that what was done would not be wasted.""

Duda's campaign has not yet responded to a request for comment on claims that the President has undermined the rule of law in Poland, eroded gay rights and rubber-stamped the PiS agenda.

Collision course with Europe

Although cultural issues have dominated campaigning, the outcome of the election has wider ramifications for Europe.

As one of the largest economies in the bloc, a big player in central Europe and a major beneficiary of EU funding, Poland should have clout.

But if Duda is reelected, Poland is likely to remain ""sitting on the sidelines in Europe,"" said Milan Nic, of the German Council on Foreign Relations, ""not playing its full weight... and seen as simply on a different wavelength to Germany and the rest of western Europe"" on issues such as climate policy and energy, thanks to its reliance on coal.

Trzaskowski told CNN he wanted to see Poland back at the table. ""Poland and this government are completely marginalized within the European Union. So it's not treated that seriously by the big powers,"" he said.

If Poland continues on its current path, in which the rule of law has been undermined by a politicization of the judiciary and public media, fellow EU member states may try to rein it in by attaching conditionality to EU funding, Buras suggested. But the PiS has until now been emboldened by the example of Hungary, where Viktor Orban has imposed an increasingly authoritarian rule in defiance of the EU.

Gerald Knaus, chairman of the European Stability Initiative think tank, said this election could be a turning point.

""One of the most important issues is the relationship between Poland and what has been the framework for the most successful period in Polish history -- EU membership,"" he told CNN from Berlin.

""The position of the PiS, which Duda has been supporting in recent years, is that Poland can remain a full member of the EU and can benefit and continue to benefit more than any other countries from structural assistance while charting an independent course on issues like the rule of law.""

Looking beyond Europe, both candidates are keen to maintain strong ties with the United States, which has troops stationed in Poland and is a longstanding ally.

Duda has forged a tight relationship with Trump since the US President visited Warsaw in 2017.

Trzaskowski, on the other hand, tweeted on July 1 that he would be speaking with former US President Barack Obama that evening ""about the importance of Polish democracy within the European Union and the significance of the U.S.-Polish alliance.""

What is the path to victory?

Despite his apparent momentum, Trzaskowski faces an uphill struggle to claim victory on Sunday based on the first-round tallies.

Duda has presided over a period during which Poland's economy has been in very good shape, said Buras, in part because of reforms enacted by the government since it was elected in 2015. And his message to voters is that the very close cooperation between president and government is in the interests of Poland and should continue.

Duda's harsh language on LGBT issues appears to be an attempt to mobilize the so-called ""silent majority"" by painting Trzaskowski ""as someone who, once elected, will be a source of cultural Armageddon,"" Buras said, although this approach may have reached its limit.

In Sunday's vote, Trzaskowski is likely to garner support from those who previously backed third-placed Szymon Holownia, a former TV host who ran as an independent, and left-wing candidates.

But to win, he must also pick up voters who supported far-right Confederation candidate Krzysztof Bosak two weeks ago, said Buras.

Although some will prefer Duda for his conservative values, others may now back Trzaskowski for reasons of free market radicalism, since they dislike the big-state spending of the PiS, or simply to prevent PiS from killing off their party as its chief competitor on the right, said Buras.

The fact that the second-round vote falls in the holiday season may benefit Duda, since the more affluent, urban voters who tend to back Trzaskowski are more likely to be away, said Nic.

But it's not yet clear how fears over the coronavirus -- or the fact that Poles already made the effort to vote in the first round -- will affect turnout, or how the debate over gay rights will galvanize voters.

""Trzaskowski stands for a more active Polish presence in the EU, more pro-European, more ambitious for climate policy and energy transformation,"" said Buras. ""But in the end he bets on those voters who feel fed up with the PiS.""",2020-07-11,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/11/europe/poland-presidential-election-vote-europe-intl/index.html
Mary Ilyushina,The Russian whistleblower risking it all to expose the scale of an Arctic oil spill catastrophe,"Norilsk, Russia (CNN) Vasily Ryabinin stands on the banks of the River Daldykan and pushes a long stick into the blood-orange sludge. Raising the stick, he puts a lighter to it and it ignites it like a torch.

""Still burns really well,"" Ryabinin says. ""It's very likely that these puddles are stretching all over the river and will be polluting it for a very long time.""

We were a few kilometers from the Siberian city of Norilsk , where six weeks ago a huge fuel tank at a power plant ruptured, spilling thousands of tons of diesel into the river.

The owner of the plant, the Nornickel metals giant, says the spill was quickly contained, and the damage limited. Ryabinin has sacrificed his job and his family's future in Norilsk in an attempt to lift the lid on what environmentalists have called the worst ecological catastrophe in the polar Arctic.

It was 2 a.m. in the Arctic summer. A half-light illuminated the fast-moving river as it flowed through the endless tundra towards the Arctic ocean. A rainbow film of oil covered the surface; a pool of diesel squelched beneath our feet.

Ryabinin brought us there by foot along railroad tracks. Ever since the spill, the areas surrounding the site have been guarded by security personnel, making them difficult to access.

He is a rare creature in today's Russia -- a whistleblower who quit his job with the state environmental agency Rosprirodnadzor and went public about the extent of the disaster.

Ryabinin says he was first alerted to the scale of the crisis on May 29 by photographs posted on Instagram. He was immediately alarmed: the Daldykan and another river polluted by the spill flow into Lake Pyasino. From there, the contamination could spread all the way to the Arctic Ocean.

Vasily Ryabinin

Just a few hours later he was at the river, taking photographs that would soon provoke a public outcry. He and his boss tried to get in to the Nornickel plant, but he says they were refused entry by police.

More than 20,000 tons of diesel poured into the rivers from the storage tank, according to Nornickel.

Foaming red sludge mixed with the water and sucked life from the rivers and their banks.

""It looked horrible when we got there and it wasn't even the worst of it as a couple of hours had passed,"" Ryabinin says. ""You could smell the diesel half a kilometer away... my boss was even afraid to smoke there in case it blew up.""

What he saw was very different from what officials and media were later reporting: that the spill had swiftly been brought under control. Russian state TV ran reports showing aerial pictures of oil-spill booms guarding the crimson layer of diesel.

""It was such an obvious, childish lie, I couldn't wrap my head around it,"" Ryabinin told CNN.

""Obviously I thought we must at least investigate the lake but my [agency] had a different view, which corresponded with the one of the [Nornickel] plant — that the spill did not spread further that the river.""

Ryabinin says the last straw for him was when Rosprirodnadzor told him to stop looking into the disaster after he had found a helicopter to fly to the lake. At that point, on June 7, he went public, recording a 45-minute account of what he'd found -- concluding that the volume of fuel and speed of the stream must have spread the contamination further.

Rosprirodnadzor did not respond to CNN's request for comment. In an email, Nornickel told CNN that the cleanup of the spill was ongoing, and that the company was ""guided by the official data of Rosprirodnadzor and the Ministry of Emergency Situations,"" as well as satellite imagery that shows ""the borders of the fuel spread.""

A sample collected by Ryabinin on the day of the spill.

A layer of gasoline visible on the surface of the Daldykan River.

Back in Moscow, YouTube blogger and environmentalist Georgy Kavanosyan made the same calculation as Ryabinin.

""All you needed to do is look at the satellite imagery, establish the area of ​​this red spot and divide it by the thousands of tons we were told poured into the water,"" Kavanosyan says. ""And you'd get that the diesel would have to run 50 meters thick to stop there — so that's clearly impossible.""

""They only caught the very tail of this spill and no-one even mentioned what's under the film, state TV kept showing the spill saying there is allegedly nothing under it and it's just on the surface,"" Kavanosyan told CNN. ""And under this layer, hydrocarbons dissolve and infiltrate all life — fish, roe, mud, everything.""

After watching Ryabinin's video, Kavanosyan decided to travel to the region to take independent samples from Lake Pyasino -- and find out whether the pollution had reached the lake.

Norilsk is a difficult place to operate in. It's a remote 'mono-city' where one company and one industry dominate the economy -- enjoying considerable influence as a result. More than 2,800 kilometers northeast of Moscow, the city was founded during Stalin's reign as a site for gulag prisoners. There is no overland connection with the rest of Russia: to get there and back, you have to fly. Foreigners need to get special permission from the Federal Security Agency, or FSB, to get in.

Kavanosyan says he and his cameraman pretended to be on a personal visit and stayed in rented apartments, avoiding main streets. At night they snuck out to the river hoping to find a boat to take them to the lake.

""It was hard, half the people here work for Nornickel and it would've obviously been a risk for them,"" Kavanosyan says.

When they finally reached the lake, they found contamination levels of dissolved hydrocarbons 2.5 higher than officially permissible, Kavanosyan said. He was the only one who managed to take independent samples from that area.

Others were not so lucky. Journalists from Novaya Gazeta said they faced constant harassment from Nornickel guards as they investigated another area with Vasily Ryabinin, finding a place where waste water was being pumped right into the tundra. Nornickel later admitted violations at the tailing pond and suspended local staff. Russia's Investigative Committee launched an investigation into this incident.

Greenpeace Russia also spent two weeks trying to get samples from Lake Pyasino but said the authorities constantly tried to obstruct their work — a police helicopter located them in a forest hut and their boat fuel was confiscated.

A Moscow city lawmaker, who agreed to carry the samples gathered by journalists and Greenpeace activists back to the capital, says he had them confiscated at the local airport last week.

In a video posted by Novaya Gazeta, airport staff said that the airport ""is also Nornickel"" and that taking water samples out required the company's permission.

When asked to comment on these allegations, Nornickel said that ""the emergency regime has been installed at the site and access to many locations is restricted.""

This spill was by no means the first environmental disaster in this part of Siberia, some of whose rivers flow red with toxic waste from factories amid lax environmental regulations. Locals have complained about acidic gases polluting the air; the edges of Norilsk resemble a huge rusting junkyard with dead trees as far as the eye can see.

""Everything is dying here,"" said Andrey, a local driver who did not want to disclose his last name. ""People are mostly concerned about the gas, sometimes it gets so bad we don't let out kids outside.""

But this rare spotlight on the city and Nornickel has prompted the company to provide public explanations, accept full responsibility for the spill and accept the cost of the clean-up. Last week it said that over 90% of fuel from the spill had been collected.

In its preliminary assessment the company blamed melting permafrost for affecting the fuel tank's foundations but said an investigation was still ongoing.

Arctic Russia is indeed warming, and a melting permafrost is potentially devastating for infrastructure in the region. More than 60% of the country's vast land surface is underlain by permafrost . This summer in Norilsk has also been abnormally hot.

But both Kavanosyan and Ryabinin doubt that the tank's sudden collapse was due to climate change. They say Russia has enough experience building on ice and can artificially freeze the ground if needed. They believe it's likely that poor maintenance or lack of oversight are to blame.

A dump on the river bank next to an pre-processing plant on the outskirts of Norilsk.

The scandal, and Ryabinin's allegations, have also prompted Rostekhnadzor, a state body which oversees the maintenance of industrial infrastructure, to disclose that its specialists had not been able to gain access to the tank at the Nornickel plant for five years.

The spill has even drawn in President Vladimir Putin, who chaired a televised meeting with the head of Nornickel, Vladimir Potanin, in early June. Potanin said the company expects to pay about $140 million to cover the damages.

""One vessel that contained the fuel costs much less, incomparably less,"" Putin replied. ""I'm saying that if you had changed that one tank on time there wouldn't have been any damage to nature, and the company wouldn't have to cover such expenses.""

Beyond the rare public spotlight on an environmental issue in Russia, the Nornickel spill has provided an even rarer example of dissent and protest winning out in Russia. Weeks after the findings by Ryabinin and Kavanosyan, the state agency Rosprirodnadzor admitted that Lake Pyasino had been contaminated.

On Wednesday it estimated the damage to be 14 times greater than Nornickel's initial assessment and asked it to pay a record $2 billion in compensation.

The company disputed the assessment, saying the agency had based its calculations ""on principles that have distorted the results and need to be adjusted."" It also added that it remains committed to its obligation to eliminate the consequences of the spill at their own expense.

Kavanosyan called Rosprirodnadzor's action ""revolutionary"" and said it sent a signal to all enterprises that choose to ""dump waste into rivers and lakes and save on wastewater treatment plants.""

As for Ryabinin, he is preparing to leave Norilsk and move his family somewhere else.

""This is quite sad because I really love my city, the North and I don't want to leave,"" he said. ""But I did this knowing that I will not be able to live and work here after all of this.""",2020-07-10,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/10/europe/arctic-oil-spill-russia-whistleblower-intl/index.html
Matt Villano,Are cell phone calls on airplane flights inevitable?,"(CNN) — Ah, holiday travel . Between huge crowds and weather delays, flying during this time of year is hectic. Now close your eyes and imagine the entire scenario with one additional annoyance: Loud talkers yammering into their cell phones at 35,000 feet.

Don't worry -- this potentially ear-splitting scenario isn't a reality yet. At least not in the United States . But it could be soon. Some even say it's just a year or two away.

The technology to support midair cell phone calls exists right now.

Just about every plane that offers WiFi has the bandwidth to support voice over the internet, and several international airlines allow voice calls on certain routes already. Still, at least on domestic US flights, voice calls are forbidden for four distinct reasons: flight attendants, public perception, concerns about safety and US law.

Airline officials won't even consider in-flight cell-phone calls until or unless they feel there is overwhelming demand from customers to provide the service, according to Henry Harteveldt, president of Atmosphere Research Group, a travel industry analysis firm in San Francisco. Even then, airlines still may not cave in.

""No matter how you look at it, allowing cell phone calls on planes is controversial,"" he says. ""These are precisely the kinds of issues airlines tend to avoid addressing unless they must.""

Keeping cabins calm

Flight attendants already mediate many passenger disputes. Shutterstock

Without question, flight attendants are the biggest barrier to allowing voice calls in the air.

Pretty much across the board, people who work in airplane cabins say the idea of allowing passengers unfettered in-flight phone use would lead to chaos, conflict and downright craziness in flight. As such, they oppose phone use vociferously.

Flight attendants are already tasked with managing overhead bin use, monitoring drink intake among unruly passengers and mediating fights between seat-recliners and passengers who don't recline.

Taylor Garland, spokesperson for the Association of Flight Attendants, a union representing 50,000 flight attendants at 20 airlines, says her colleagues don't want to take on any more policing of passengers' social behaviors.

""We are strongly against voice calls on planes,"" she wrote in a recent email. In another, she doubled down with all caps: ""NO CELL PHONES.""

Flight attendants' opposition is significant.

They've had major influence on certain decisions regarding domestic passenger travel. In recent years, they've been at the forefront of efforts to get airlines to control unruly passengers. In the 1980s, they led the charge against cigarettes in cabins, which ultimately led to full-fledged bans on in-flight smoking by 2000.

On the issue of in-flight cell phone calls, flight attendants say that passengers inevitably would offend some neighbors by being too loud, and arguments would surely follow.

Cassandra Michele Brown, a flight attendant who works for Frontier Airlines, adds that unfettered cell phone use in midair likely would prevent passengers from complying with flight attendant instructions in the event of an emergency.

""At the end of the day, our job is to evacuate an aircraft in 90 seconds or less,"" says Brown, who is based out of Las Vegas.

""If you're a passenger on my flight, no matter how good you might be at multitasking, you're not going to be able to follow my step-by-step instructions to evacuate if you're focusing on your phone.""

Passengers advocating for quiet

Among the travel experts and the traveling public, feelings about allowing voice calls in the air are mixed.

Much like the flight attendants, a vocal contingent of passengers has emerged as opponents of loud noise, insisting that an open environment for in-flight cell-phone calls will create an ""annoying"" cacophony of chaos in the skies and undoubtedly trigger disagreements about what volume is appropriate.

Harteveldt, the analyst, is in this camp, and says research recently conducted by his firm estimates that less than 5% of all domestic air passengers want to use their cell phones in midair.

""I don't want to be forced to overhear someone else's conversation if it's avoidable,"" he says. ""It's bad enough when you find yourself in that situation at a coffee shop or in a hotel lobby. In an airplane at cruising altitude, in a situation where you can't do anything or go anywhere to escape, it would be horrendous.""

Other passengers say privacy also would be a concern, since even first-class passengers are packed tightly into airplane seats for the duration of most flights.

Business travelers, however, seem to be more utilitarian in their thinking.

Paul Forgue, a consultant who manages performance improvement for a global private equity portfolio company and travels 40 weeks a year, says he could see situations in which in-flight phone use could come in handy.

""For those work emergencies when you really need to have contact with someone, it would be fantastic to know you could pick up your phone and do that from the plane,"" says Forgue, who is based in San Francisco. ""In those situations where you need to talk to a colleague about something you can't articulate via text or email, it'd be perfect -- provided people don't take advantage.""

One strategy Forgue says airlines could implement to allow in-flight cell phone calls: Special areas of the plane for those passengers who wish to use their phones and special areas for those passengers who do not.

This is the plan deployed by Amtrak and various commuter rail systems across the country. For the most part -- save for the occasional abusers or overflow problems on crowded trips -- it works.

Is the technology safe?

The story of in-cabin calls from personal electronic devices is a colorful saga that goes back decades.

In the 1980s and 1990s, when cellular technology became mainstream, use on planes went relatively unchecked. If you're 40 or older, you probably remember the seatback handsets available to anyone with the swipe of a credit card for upwards of $4 or $5 per minute. These essentially were early public cell phones.

Even after the turn of the millennium, cell phone calls were mostly unregulated; victims of the 9/11 terror attacks were able to call their loved ones from the hijacked airplanes before the planes crashed.

The rise of smartphones changed everything.

As phones became more sophisticated, industry insiders worried about the possibility of a phone's radio transmitter interfering with certain equipment in the cockpit and therefore rendering some of the equipment unreliable.

Many of these concerns were stoked by published papers about the potential effects of electromagnetic interference to flight navigation and communication systems. The gist of those reports: Some devices had the potential to interfere with unshielded cockpit instruments, and that such interference could in worst-case scenarios affecting the regular operation of the plane.

Airline experts subsequently have noted that this was an issue with older devices on older aircraft.

Seth Miller, an industry analyst and the owner of the PaxEx.areo blog, said newer phones operate at much higher frequencies, and newer planes are designed to not be affected by the amount of electronics that passengers bring when they fly.

""There was one documented example of something affecting depth [instruments] in one very specific old (airline) model when under certain circumstances, says Miller. ""But nobody was able to determine with certainty if it was a phone leaking radio frequency when it shouldn't have been -- or an instrument screen not being shielded from certain frequencies when it should have been.""

""The reality is that new technology and new equipment have all but eliminated this problem,"" says Miller. ""There's no longer any technical reason for people to not use cell phones on planes.""

Internationally, in fact, a handful of airlines have inked deals with third-party vendors to offer and allow satellite-based internet services that support voice calls via cell phones. Some of these include British Airways, Emirates and Etihad.

Viasat, a communication company based in Carlsbad, California, is one of those vendors. Don Buchman, the company's vice president and general manager of commercial aviation, says his company's systems could carry voice calls over the internet tomorrow if airline customers wanted to do so.

""Most airlines have the ability to permit devices to make voice calls but choose not to,"" he says. ""When the industry is ready, it probably will be as simple as flipping a switch.""

Regulatory, practical obstacles

Though it's not technically illegal to make voice calls from cell phones on commercial flights, there are two major regulatory restrictions that have that same effect.

First, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the US federal agency that oversees US telecommunications transmissions, prohibits airborne use of the two of the most frequently used cellular bands.

The agency recently considered a proposal that would have allowed air passengers to use their phones for calls at high altitude. This policy was introduced in 2013 by then FCC-Chairman Tom Wheeler, but current FCC Chairman Ajit Pai quashed it in 2017. At the time, Pai said in a statement he did not think the proposal gave travelers what he thought they wanted.

""Taking it off the table permanently will be a victory for Americans who, like me, value a moment of quiet at 30,000 feet,"" he said.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has taken a similar stance.

Section 403 of the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 states, ""The Secretary of Transportation shall issue regulations to prohibit an individual on an aircraft from engaging in voice communications using a mobile communications device during a flight of that aircraft in scheduled passenger interstate or intrastate air transportation.""

The law allows exceptions for flight crews and law enforcement officers.

Granted, the push for making cell-phone voice calls might subside on its own. Texting already is allowed on many US domestic carriers -- and more and more business travelers are embracing group text services as replacements for conference calls. Then, of course, there's email, which is also available for passengers who pony up the cash for access to standard in-flight WiFi.

Who calls people anyway?

What's more, millennials and younger generations rarely talk on the phone.

Miller, from the PaxEx.areo blog, predicts that regulatory agencies eventually will remove the limits on in-flight cell phone calls, leaving it up to individual airlines to decide whether this is a service they want to provide.

""When there are safety reasons for something not to happen, the aviation world always will try to err on the side of safety,"" he says. ""On the flip side, now that we know there's no risk associated with cell phone use in-flight, the FAA and the FCC might change the rules, and if they do, it's not a given that airlines will embrace it.""

Despite the relative technical viability of in-flight cell phone calls, it still could be years before travelers may have to grapple with them in real life given all the opposition.

Maggie Hiufu Wong,"'Hamlet' in the skies? The story behind Taiwan's newest airline, STARLUX","(CNN) — Debuting its first flights in January 2020, Taiwanese start-up STARLUX Airlines could be the first new player in 30 years to upend the island's duopoly aviation market.

And even before the carrier, dubbed Taiwan's first luxury boutique airline, set its first aircraft into the air, it's been creating a stir.

Eleven minutes after opening ticket sales online on December 16, the Taipei-based carrier sold out all seats on its first three flights -- Taipei-Macau, Taipei-Penang and Taipei-Danang.

But both aviation watchers and the general public are abuzz for another reason: A succession drama involving STARLUX founder Chang Kuo-wei that's so juicy he's being referred to as the aviation industry's ""Prince Hamlet"" by local media.

This Shakepearean tale took root in 2016, when Chang Yung-fa, founder of Taiwan's Evergreen Group and airline EVA Airways, passed away at the age of 88, sparking a battle over who would take over one of the island's biggest family-run conglomerates.

Chang, 49, who had been the chairman of EVA since 2013, revealed that his late father had named him the successor of parent company Evergreen in his will.

A well-loved figure in the aviation industry, known for his outspokenness and expertise, the son had experience working for EVA Airways as both an aircraft technician and a pilot.

But being the youngest son and the only child of Chang Yung-fa's second wife, Chang Kuo-wei's promotion ignited a family feud. He was soon ousted from EVA as chairman at a board meeting called by fellow family members.

A few months later, he announced that he was going to launch his own airline -- STARLUX Airlines.

""He doesn't think that he's 'Hamlet'""

Local media have called it a Hamlet-like retaliation plan.

The anticipation of the new airline's launch has grown as both EVA Airways and China Airlines, Taiwan's two main airlines, have been plagued by strikes and internal conflicts.

But according to the team at STARLUX, Chang isn't out for retribution.

""He doesn't think that he is 'Hamlet',"" K.W. Nieh, STARLUX's chief communication officer, tells CNN Travel. ""This has nothing to do with revenge.""

""Because of his passion for aviation, Chang merely wants to build an ideal airline that reflects his style after breaking from the shackles of Evergreen Group. He is building STARLUX to fulfill the expectations of his late father.""

CNN Travel has reached out to EVA Air for comment.

Whether or not Taipei-based STARLUX can outdo the other major players on the island remains to be seen, but it's certainly upped Taiwan's aviation game.

The airline is introducing a new generation of passenger aircraft, including the A321neo and A350-1000, ""both debuting for the first time in Taiwan,"" says Nieh.

Indeed, STARLUX is the first Taiwanese airline to be equipped with A321neos -- all 10 of them will be delivered by the end of 2021. STARLUX signed Taiwan's largest single Airbus purchase agreement, purchasing 17 A350XWB aircraft in March 2019.

Chang himself piloted STARLUX's first A321neo to Taipei from Hamburg last month.

""The fleet will grow to 27 aircraft by the end of 2024 and 50 by the end of 2030,"" adds Nieh.

The interior of the narrow body cabin, designed by BMW's Designworks studio, is fitted with sleek seats, leather headrests and inflight entertainment systems across all classes.

Economy class seats will feature a 10.1-inch 720p screen while business class seats -- equipped with narrow-body seats that can recline into an 82-inch fully flat bed -- will offer a 15.6-inch 1080p inflight entertainment system.

Free Wi-Fi with basic access (texting only for economy passengers) will be offered for both classes on all STARLUX flights -- also a first in Taiwan.

Local touches abound as well. A unique cabin scent -- with notes of woods, leather and florals -- has been created by Taiwan-grown fragrance brand P.Seven. The airline's crew uniform, which bears themes of retro-futuristic travel in the 40s and 50s, is the product of local designer Sean Yin.

No fare war: STARLUX will charge more than competitors

Aspiring to be the Emirates of Asia, STARLUX vows to provide premium service, too.

At a recent press event, Chang said STARLUX Airlines will not start a fare war. Instead, its tickets will be reasonable but more expensive than its competitors.

""We consider flying as an enjoyable part of the journey,"" adds Nieh. ""We offer top-notch and exquisite services. It differentiates STARLUX from other companies in the market.

""We position ourselves as a boutique airline, targeting the higher-end market. We have introduced the most advanced aircraft models with the latest aviation technology and seats. We offer exquisite service items so the fare will be slightly higher than the other airlines.""

According to aviation expert CK Law, senior adviser of the Department of Aviation Policy at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, this unique positioning is a clever move for STARLUX.

""Many new airlines have been tapping into the low-cost sector in the market, particularly in this part of the world,"" says Law.

""That's definitely the major trend. There should be reasonable demand for the high-end passenger segment of the market.""

But he expects the new airline will still have an impact on airfares in the long run.

""From the passengers' point of view, there will be new and substantial benefits for them to have new choices and possible new fare reductions in the longer term. There'll be competition for better services on the plane,"" says Law.

Potential cut-throat competition

Taiwan has been enjoying healthy passenger growth numbers as well as flights in recent years.

Boeing has estimated that Taiwan's aviation demand will be stronger than the Northeast Asia region's annual average -- 2% over the next two decades -- as a whole.

But is there enough space to accommodate another major airline?

""A new full-service airline would definitely introduce a lot of new competition to a traditional aviation market like Taiwan,"" says Law.

""Whether the new airline or even the existing airlines can survive because of this will mainly depend on how fast the market will grow and whether the new demand could absorb or balance with the new supply capacity.

""Otherwise, that could be a cut-throat competition and there could be casualties.""

One of the biggest questions is: Can a newcomer carve a spot for itself in the long-haul and transit markets, the two markets STARLUX plans to explore?

""I would expect a good, high load factor being achieved for the short haul tourism markets but the long haul destinations, which have [major competition in Taiwan,] would definitely be more challenging,"" says Law.

""It won't be easy for new airlines to join a reputable alliance, to start with. Without being a member of an alliance, it won't be easy at all to get transit passengers. But it can be a long-term goal,"" says Law.

Nieh, on the other hand, is confident.

""The development of STARLUX doesn't solely rely on the Taiwan market. Taipei has a superior geographical location -- you can reach major Asian cities within five hours"" he says.

""Located in a central position connecting North America, North Asia and Southeast Asia, Taiwan has the best foundation to develop as an aviation hub. By introducing and building its hardware and software, the aviation industry of Taiwan will hopefully become the transportation hub of Asia, strengthen its transit services and bring a large number of international passengers to Taiwan.""

Nieh points to a recent study by the Taiwan government's National Audit Office, which claims only 10% of the island's inbound travelers are transit passengers.

""Comparing to Hong Kong, Incheon, Shanghai and Tokyo, there is room for market development,"" says Nieh. ""We're very certain about this part.""

The initial rush for ticket sales has been good news for STARLUX.

""Tickets to Macau sold out in six minutes; tickets to Danang sold out in nine and tickets to Penang sold out in 11 minutes,"" Liwen Liu, director of STARLUX's corporate communications division tells CNN.

""All 188 seats on each of the three flights.

""We're very happy about it. We had our expectations but the response has been better than what we expected,"" says Liu.

Shana Clarke,Copenhagen's new Metro is a thing of beauty,"Copenhagen (CNN) — In Copenhagen, traffic is usually caused by the two-wheel variety of transportation: the bicycle.

Ever since bicycles were imported into Denmark from France in 1869, they have become the main form of transportation in the Scandinavian city. In the 1920s, it wasn't unusual to see both the working class as well as high society pedaling through the streets. But with the opening of the Metro's new M3 Cityring line, commuters have a new way of getting around.

While Copenhagen's Metro has always been rather efficient, many neighborhoods lacked stations, and thus, accessibility.

In addition, a growing population of about 10,000 new residents per year is taxing the buses and trains already in circulation. In a city of 650,000 people, about 200,000 commute on the Metro daily, sometimes in conjunction with a bike during their journey.

Greater accessibility

Cityring, a 15.5-kilometer (approximately 9.63 miles) circular line with 17 new stops — which nearly doubles the number of existing stations — now connects outlying neighborhoods that radiate far from the city center. Residents won't need to rely on their bikes to get around, a boon especially during Copenhagen's hygge-inducing winters.

The impetus for the project was twofold, according to Henrik Ploughmann Olsen, CEO of Copenhagen Metro. ""First of all, it was a question of improving public transport, making it more efficient and of better quality,"" he said. ""But it was also about city development in other areas outside of the city center.""

Courtesy The Copenhagen Metro

Public squares were constructed, with 150 benches and 800 trees, were installed around the 17 new stations. The plazas not only allow access to the Metro, but will hopefully encourage more commerce and housing.

""We see that it attracts shops but also offices and service-oriented businesses,"" said Olsen.

Building the line was not without its challenges.

Olsen acknowledged that the eight years of construction impeded traffic and generally disrupted people's daily lives. ""We had the machinery right outside people's windows for quite a substantial number of years,"" he said.

Technical issues also challenged tunnel designers. They had to build around older structures with shaky foundations, such as the historic Frederik's Church, a.k.a. Marble Church, at the Marmorkirken station.

Controlling groundwater was also imperative during construction.

""A lot of the houses in the inner part of the old city center are actually founded on wooden piles from the 17th century or 18th century,"" explained Olsen, ""If you remove the groundwater from those piles, they'll rot.""

In addition, builders had to deftly maneuver around existing Metro tunnels--but Olsen proudly notes the extension was completed without causing any shutdowns to the current system.

Shiny, new rails

The new M3 line allows Copenhagen to compete on an international level. Reginaldo Sales/Metro Company

The line itself is a thing of beauty; sleek and gleaming like a seal shimmying through water, this shiny new rail line is runs automatically without any conductors.

The system operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year -- a rare service offered by only a small handful of cities worldwide, including New York City, Chicago, and Melbourne -- and a full rotation around the line takes 24 minutes. Average speed is about 40 kilometers per hour (approximately 25 miles per hour) but when a train hits top speed, it can cruise at 90 kilometer an hour (55 miles per hour).

Unlike older stations, all the new stops are outfitted with two elevators instead of one and the incline of stairs was reduced to make going up and down flights less taxing. For today's iTouch culture, screens by ticket machines supply riders with route information and maps.

Not just easy on the ride, Cityring's stations are easy on the eyes.

Glass and light are key design elements and stations were designed to integrate with their surroundings. At the Frederiksberg Allé station, for example, the green interior color scheme is a segue to the outdoor park that greets riders when they reach street level.

Cleanliness and efficiency are two tenets of the Metro system. Revenue generated from ticket sales is reinvested into maintenance, and quarterly surveys of passengers give Metro operators direction on what's working, what's not and where they need to direct funds.

Bike-friendly

The Cityring doesn't want to compete with bikes, but instead integrate itself into existing transportation infrastructure. ""Metro actually supports the thoughts of the having bikes being either last mile or first mile mode of transportation, so you could use it in combination,"" said Olsen.

Bikes are allowed on the Metro during non-rush hours, and cellars at every station provide storage for the two-wheeled vehicles when not in use. Screens at exit points announce nearby bus and train departures for easy connections.

While these features have residents excited about the new system, Olsen believes ""the most important thing is that you don't have to look up time table,"" he said. ""You can just go through the station and there'll be a train right after."" To him, freedom from the shackles of a schedule exemplifies the ease of using the Metro.

The new M3 line — and the expansion of the Metro in general — not only services the city internally, but allows Copenhagen to compete on an international level. Citing Hamburg, Germany, and Stockholm, Sweden as nearby rivals, Olsen hopes to attract both businesses and tourists to Copenhagen via opportunities presented by the Metro.

With the opening of the M3 Cityring, ridership is expected to rise from 65 million to 122 million by 2020, and two extensions to the existing M4 line are due to open over the next five year.

While projections are ambitious, Olsen's definition of success is more modest.",2020-07-14,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/metro-cityring-copenhagen-denmark/index.html
Tamara Hardingham-Gill,Mystery Hotel Budapest: The hotel designed for likes,"(CNN) — One of the first things you'll notice on entering the Mystery Hotel Budapest is the Aladdin-style magic carpet ""floating"" above the reception desk.

This is the first indication there's much more to this boutique hotel than meets the eye.

Then there's the countless light boxes on the walls displaying animated pictures that change several times a day and the elevator, which is partially hidden by velvet curtains.

Depending on which room you're staying in, you could find yourself lying against a headboard with a version of Johannes Vermeer's ""Girl with a Pearl Earring,"" where the ""girl"" has an iPhone in her hand, or a ""party girl"" interpretation of Da Vinci's ""Mona Lisa"" complete with VIP passes to Budapest's Sziget Festival.

And if you happen to book visit the ""secret"" Pythagoras meeting room, you'll have to figure out how to open it yourself (hint -- there's an unassuming box involved).

Located in Budapest's Terézváros district, the Mystery Hotel is arguably one of the most thrilling hotels in the city thanks to the intrigue that lies inside its walls.

It's set inside what was once the main headquarters of the Symbolic Grand Lodge of Hungarian Freemasons, providing the inspiration for its enigmatic theme, along with movies such as ""The Da Vinci Code.""

While it lacks the dramatic city views and central location of some of Budapest more famous hotels, the property, which opened in May 2019, is fast becoming one of the most Instagram-friendly places to stay in Budapest.

This is certainly no accident. In fact, the hotel's designer Zoltán Varró admits he had ""likes"" in mind when conceptualizing the property.

""Instagram has really changed the hotel industry,"" Varró tells CNN Travel. ""Around 20 years ago, people wanted to go to big names because they felt safe with them.

""Now the most important thing is to stand out. Everyone is looking for something special. Social media is vital.

""When a guest sees something amazing and takes a picture, it can be shared with the rest of the world in seconds.""

Viktória Berényi, director of business development at the Mystery Hotel, says social media has helped to bring in a large number of bookings.

""First impressions are everything,"" says Berényi. ""There's a lot of competition in Budapest. We had some difficulties with the engagement of people at first.

""But we've had lots of guests who come here because they saw the pictures on Instagram.""

One of the many intriguing areas of the hotel is the Great Hall, which serves as a dining area, a bar, as well as a lobby.

Varró decided to make it the building's main focus after seeing photographs displaying the significance of the room during the 1890s, when Hungarian Freemasons regularly congregated here.

Freemasonry past

One of the most influential and well-known secret societies, Freemasonry was founded in the UK, but quickly spread to Europe and the rest of the world.

The secular movement models itself upon the fraternities of medieval stonemasons, who used secret words and symbols to recognize each others' legitimacy.

After the former Republic of Councils in Hungary and later the Interior Minister of Hungary, Mihály Dömötör, banned the activities of Freemasons in 1920, the building went on to serve as a military hospital.

It was also used by the Hungarian National Guard Association, before returning to Freemasonry use after World War II. But during the communism era it went on to house the Ministry of the Interior until the fall of the regime in 1989.

Needless to say, the building changed considerably during its many different incarnations and its Freemasonry elements were concealed.

""After communism, the room was destroyed,"" says Varró. ""The Freemason aspects were completely covered, as no one wanted to talk about this.

""I didn't want it [the Great Hall] to be hidden away. This is the heart of the building.""

Its vaulted ceiling, which has been completely restored, is decorated with beautiful motifs, while the walls are adorned with bright columns and light boxes.

Although the entire hotel is filled with chandeliers, the largest hangs directly over a marble chess board floor area in the Great Hall.

At the far end of the room, two iron spiral stairs lead up to the gallery, where a private dining area aimed at larger groups can be found.

Lit up by candles, the grand staircase is one of various elements preserved from the original building, which dates back to 1896, along with the main doors.

You can see elements of the facade of the old building and the new building alongside each other from the sixth floor.

Varró has preserved various motifs used in Masonic symbolism around the buildings, along with sculptures of a sphinx, a square and compass.

Even the paintings in the corridors are linked to Freemasonry, some are the work of Freemasons background, while others are by artists from countries with strong links to the secular movement.

However, Berényi stresses the Mystery Hotel represents far more than just Freemasonry, noting the organization, which has been blighted by conspiracy theories, may hold negative connotations for some.

""As much as we are proud of the history, we can't make everything about the Freemasons, as they represent different things to different people,"" she says.

Unique suites

There are three different suite styles, Doric, Ion and Corinthian. The Doric rooms, which overlook the hotel's courtyard and the Secret Garden Spa, hold English Victorian style features and are decorated in various shades of green.

The Ion rooms are based on the upper floors of the hotel and possess a French mansard style, while the Corinthian rooms hold Baroque style furnishings, such as burgundy velvet curtains.

Located on the sixth floor, the Atelier Suite is the most unique suite in the building. Designed to resemble a painter's studio, it holds a marble staircase, brick walls, huge paintings and dozens of rugs. Even the TV stand takes the form of an art easel.

""The original plan was to have this room as a storage area, because it only has two small windows,"" explains Varró.

""When I decided to make it one of the biggest suites, the owner thought I was crazy. But it's been very popular.""

The suite is often requested for private gatherings, with the likes of Italian luxury fashion house Dolce&Gabbana hiring it for private events.

Impressive spa

While the Great Hall is a tough act to follow, not to mention rooftop bar the Sky Garden, which provides views of the Royal Palace, the hotel spa is another stand out spot.

There are plenty of beautiful thermal baths to choose from in Budapest, which means any hotel spa here has to be pretty impressive in order to entice visitors.

However, the Secret Garden Day Spa definitely doesn't disappoint.

Situated in the hotel's enclosed courtyard, it has a Baroque garden feel, with dramatic palm trees and a beautiful fountain.

Guests have the option to relax on day beds, slip into the sauna and steam room, or opt for some of the many cosmetic, body treatments and massages on offer.

The lighting in the spa is also fantastic due to its courtyard position, along with an array of crystal chandeliers.

""This was an empty place,"" says Varró. ""I wanted to create something different. I think this [the courtyard] is the perfect place for a spa. Budapest is not a very sunny city, but it's always summer here.""

Its center piece is undoubtedly the magnificent whirlpool, which provides a fantastic view of the facade of the building.

Tamara Hardingham-Gill,How Budapest became a fine dining force to be reckoned with,"(CNN) — While Budapest may be primarily known for its architecture, geothermal springs and communist heritage, the city's gastronomy scene has been gaining considerable travel attention in recent years.

New and exciting fine dining spots are constantly opening up in the Hungarian capital, many headed up by prolific chefs keen to inject imagination and prestige into the Budapest dining experience.

Two restaurants in the Hungarian capital were awarded new Michelin stars in the past 12 months alone, bringing the total of Michelin-awarded establishments in Budapest to six.

Hungary only received its first Michelin star nine years ago, so this is a pretty remarkable turnaround.

There's little doubt a culinary revolution is underway in the ""Pearl of the Danube,"" but what's brought about this burgeoning movement?

Record numbers of tourists and a booming economy have definitely played a part.

With Hungary's difficult past well documented, it's fair to say that fine dining hasn't necessarily been a high priority for locals haunted by Communist austerity.

""Hungary was always a pretty poor country,"" explains Hungarian food critic Andras Jokuti. ""So the main goal of Hungarian cuisine was to stay alive. It was very important to have lots of proteins and carbs -- it was based around potato and meat.""

Miguel Vieira at Budapest restaurant Costes tells CNN Travel what makes great, creative cuisine.

Shifting this perception has been a lengthy process, which continues today. However, the tide is definitely turning.

Portuguese chef Miguel Rocha Vieira believes this is partly due to good quality produce becoming more readily available in the country during the past decade.

""We'd have to buy butter from abroad [before] because there was no good quality butter here,"" he tells CNN.

""Everything is completely different now.""

Vieira heads up Costes, based in Raday Street, and was at the restaurant's helm when it became the first in the country to earn a Michelin star back in 2010.

He produces modern takes on classic Hungarian dishes, serving up four to seven-course set menus with various wine pairings.

Jokuti feels that Vieira injected life into the dining scene by merging both Hungarian and Portuguese influences into his dishes early on.

""When Miguel arrived in Budapest, it was like the very beginning of the fine dining story in Hungary,"" he says.

Vieira admits he knew little about Hungarian cuisine when he came to the country all those years ago and was often ""hammered by critics.""

""My cooking has changed a lot,"" he adds. ""Now I can tell you proudly that my stamp is in the food.""

""One of the biggest compliments we can have here is if somebody says, 'I felt this dinner had personality.""

While Vieira tries to incorporate Hungarian traditions in his dishes, this isn't the ""ultimate goal"" and he certainly doesn't have Michelin stars in mind while in the kitchen.

""I always say to the boys, 'We should cook for ourselves. We should do what we believe.' It's not about cooking for awards,"" he adds. ""It's not looking for stars or for recognition.

""That's the cherry on top of the cake. But that's not why we work 14, 15 or 16 hours a day.""

Modern interpretations

Chef Tamas Szell from Budapest restaurant Stand on his modern interpretations of traditional Hungarian dishes.

Hungarian chef Tamas Szell has been credited with putting Hungarian food on the map back in 2016, when his modern interpretations of the country's traditional dishes won him the gold medal at the prestigious 'Bocuse D'or Europe' competition.

Szell and co-chef Szabina Szulló head up the kitchen at Stand, which was awarded its first Michelin star this March, has a similar approach to cooking to Vieira.

""Food is the best communication between a chef and the guests,"" Szell tells CNN.

""Hopefully our dishes contain the sweet memories from childhood. When I cook a dish, it should be acceptable to both our grandmothers and a Michelin inspector. This is the most difficult [part] I think.""

Stand opened in Budapest in 2018 following the success of market hall bistro Stand25, which Szell and Szulló also ran together.

""My inspirations definitely come from my childhood,"" he adds. ""My mother had a saying, 'we are poor but we are living well'.""

Szell says his fisherman's soup, which contains carp, paprika, water and tiny ravioli type pasta known as deraya in Hungary, is the second most popular soup after goulash.

""When I was a child, my mother often made it this way,"" he explains.

Szell's dishes appear to be having the desired impact. Stand, based on Székely Mihály street, has been a big hit since it launched.

In fact, Jokuti describes it as the ""the perfect Hungarian restaurant,"" praising the inventive way Szell manages to tone down the richness of traditional Hungarian cuisine.

""This, I think, is his biggest achievement. To somehow recreate the traditions into something modern,"" says Jokuti.

Szell sources his dairy products from a tiny farm just outside Budapest, which supplies to a handful of fine dining restaurants in the city.

Within 48 hours of the milk leaving the cow's udder, it's being served up back at Stand in the form of cottage cheese,

""I think the ingredients are the most important thing,"" adds Szell. ""The good ingredients always try to find the chef and the chef always tries to find the best ingredients.""

Find out why Budapest restaurant Babel is a unique feature of the city's culinary scene.

Situated in Budapest's downtown, Babel is one of the most recent restaurants in the city to be awarded a Michelin star.

It's relatively small, with around a dozen tables, exposed brick walls and dim lighting, offering an intimate dining experience.

Inspired by Hungarian traditions and the Romanian region of Transylvania, chef Istvan Veres presents five to 10 course tasting menus containing simple ingredients such as nettle or lichen.

Veres says cooking is an ""obsession"" rather than a passion for him, describing how he'll often dream about a dish and then attempt to bring it to life the very next day.

""In fine dining, you have to do something special, something unique,"" he says.""You put your soul on the plate.""

""I'm never scared about new things.""

According to Jokuti, it's this fearlessness that makes Veres such a trailblazing chef.

""Istvan's taste is not that easy to follow,"" says Jokuti. ""I love to go to Babel because I'm always surprised.""

Basic ingredients

Hoping to repeat the success of Stand, Babel and Costes, is new dining establishment Salt, which has only been open since October.

It's run by chef Szilard Toth and manager Mate Boldizsar, who often serve up the dishes to diners themselves.

Toth regularly goes foraging for produce in the Hungarian countryside, coming back with all types of edible delights.

""We find so many basic ingredients that an average chef does not really see very often,"" Toth tells CNN.

""This means we can introduce a world of flavors for our food -- amazing flavor pairings that can't be found anywhere else.""

The chef's table is positioned in the middle of the restaurant, so diners can wander over to ask questions about the dishes, or just watch Toth and his team in action.

Dishes are presented simply -- some don't even require cutlery -- and customers can opt for a Hungarian wine pairing menu to complement their meal.

The team at Salt pride themselves on transforming basic produce into fine dining and the restaurant is filled with jars containing fermented or pickled items found in the forest.

""We have a course called greasy bread,"" says Boldizsar. "" In its original form, it's a very, very simple dish.

""Just a piece of bread with some fat. We put some bacon on it, some caviar and some lambskin.""

Only time will tell whether Salt will gain a coveted Michelin star, but the restaurant does seem to be winning over may diners in the short time it's been around for.

""I think he [Toth] shows that it's possible to create a very hedonistic, but still very modern meal from sometimes humble, but very Hungarian ingredients,"" says Jokuti.

A restaurant like Salt would have seemed inconceivable in the Hungarian capital a few years ago.

Its emergence is a clear indication of the adventurous direction the city's culinary scene is currently moving in.

""It's really fascinating to witness these times in Hungarian cuisine,"" says Jokuti.

""I'm traveling a lot, visiting the world's best restaurants. It's amazing to see that I can come home and eat at these fine restaurants.

""It's not like, 'Okay, it's not so good, but it's at least it's Hungarian.'",2020-07-14,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/fine-dining-budapest/index.html
Kamilla Rzayeva,Azerbaijan's secret to long life? Mountain air,"(CNN) — There are a number of destinations around the world famed for the longevity of their residents.

There's one long-lived corner of the globe you won't have heard talked about as much, and it's home to the world's only Museum of Longevity. That's Lerik in southern Azerbaijan

The South Caucasus country is home to several regions known for producing residents who live to triple-figure ages, including Lankaran and Nagorno-Karabakh. But another, Lerik, is reputed to have the highest concentration of centenarians.

In this emerald land high above the clouds in the Talysh Mountains, reached by loop after loop of a serpentine road, people seem to have discovered a secret to a long and healthy life.

The Museum of Longevity

The two-room Museum of Longevity, built in 1991 and renovated in 2010, holds more than 2,000 exhibits documenting the lives and memories of the region's oldest inhabitants.

It charts individual lifespans with the household items that they've outlived, such as three generations of clothing irons. There are chests filled with headscarves and shirts, silver pitchers and bowls, beautifully knitted socks, and hand-dyed rugs that are still brightly colored despite their age.

And then there are the letters, written in both Azerbaijani and Russian -- personal artifacts so old that the ink is starting is fade.

Perhaps the most captivating features are the portraits of centenarians that cover the museum's walls. These images, dating from the 1930s, were donated by French photographer Frederic Lachop.

The museum, and official Azerbaijan statistics, define ""centenarian"" more loosely than you'd expect: Here, it means anyone over 90 years old.

However, back in 1991, there were more than 200 people in Lerik registered as being more than 100 years old, out of a population of 63,000.

Numbers have been less impressive since then, which locals blame variously on radiation from communication towers and environmental decline, but could just as easily be down to more rigorous record-keeping.

Today, there are 11 people more than 100 years old, out of a local population of 83,800.

The tale of the 168-year-old man

Is this the world's oldest man ever? Perhaps not. Kamilla Rzayeva

Lerik's current oldest citizen is Raji Ibrahimova, at 105 years. That's a fine vintage, but it pales in comparison to the age reputedly reached by area's most celebrated centenarian, Shirali Muslumov, a shepherd who supposedly lived to be 168.

The yellow pages of his passport claim that he was born in 1805 and his gravestone states that he died in 1973. If true, it would make the the oldest person to have ever lived.

Unfortunately, back in the early 19th century, birth registrations rarely took place in such remote villages as his birthplace of Barzavu, so there is no certifable record of when he was born.

Countless letters sent from all over the world on his various birthdays leave no doubt that he was indeed of a very respectable age, but it's perhaps best to factor in a minimum 20-year margin of error.

Among those corresponding with Muslumov were Vietnamese communist leader Ho Chi Minh, who sent a postcard greeting him with the endearment, ""Dear Grandpa.""

This longevity gene seems to run in the family. His 95-year-old daughter, Halima Qambarova, tells CNN Travel that -- while she might not live to 168, like her father -- she at least hopes to live to the age of 150, like her grandfather, or 130, like her aunt.

'Stillness of the mind'

When the weather turns cold, most centenarians relocate to the kinder coastal climes of Lankaran , but Qambarova was still in the Lerik village of Barzavu when CNN Travel dropped by her father's modest two-story home, surrounded by massive apple and pear trees (probably contemporaries of her famous father).

Sitting by the window, wrapped in a shawl, she speaks with a slight accent, switching often to her native language of Talysh, a dialect spoken by just 200,000 people and classified as ""vulnerable"" by UNESCO.

She shows off her passport, which doesn't list a month or date of birth, only the year: 1924. She may be 95, but she is fully present, interacting with her great-grandchildren, and demonstrating her lively sense of humor. When asked her age, she cheerfully replies, ""15.""

""Stillness of the mind is part of their secret,"" the museum guide says. ""They stay away from stress, thinking about life quite philosophically, living one day at a time, without much planning or worry for the future.""

Good nutrition and natural remedies

Halima Qanbarova is a young thing of 95. Her grandfather is said to have lived to 150, her father to 168, and her aunt to 130. Kamilla Rzayeva

Qambarova's day starts at dawn; she doesn't let herself sleep in. ""I get up as soon as my eyes open,"" she says.

She spends the whole day working in the garden or around the house. Her room is small, with a thick soft carpet and pillows on the floor. Many people here prefer sleeping on the ground, with just a thin blanket instead of a mattress, as it's believed to be the healthiest way to rest the back.

Contrary to popular belief, the centenarians of Lerik do eat meat, but they inherited a preference for fresh dairy products such as shor (cottage cheese), butter, milk and the yoghurt drink ayran from earlier centenarians, for whom the abstinence from meat was more due to economic circumstance.

Qambarova's daughter-in-law brings in a big plate with pears and apples from their garden and some aromatic tea.

It's herbal, floral and refreshing. Back at the museum, the guide shows a table with the various herbs native to Lerik.

""The secret of long life is good nutrition, the minerals in the spring water and the herbs that we add to tea to prevent illnesses, so people don't have to take any medicine, only using the natural remedies,"" says the guide. Indeed, Qambarova insists she's never taken any medication.

Generations living side by side

Beyond her windows, it may seem that the village is quiet and still. But the physical work that villagers put in every day is immense. From sunrise until sunset they work in gardens and fields as well as around the house. They sew and knit and take care of big families.

Such was the lifestyle of Mammadkhan Abbasov, a 103-year-old from Jangamiran village. Sitting on the carpet, across from the window, the centenarian has almost completely lost his sight and can barely hear his son telling him that guests have arrived, but when he finally catches it, he starts singing, offering prayers and good wishes.

At Abbasov's side is his great grandson -- a century gap between them.

Just like Qambarova, Abbasov has been a busy villager his whole life, working in the fields until about seven years ago, when his vision deteriorated.

'Whatever God gives'

Lerik is testament to the benefits of fresh mountain air. Kamilla Rzayeva

""He has always been a good man and lived his life properly,"" his son says.

In terms of food, he eats ""whatever God gives"" with just one restriction -- he never drinks alcohol.

Abbasov attributes his long life to daily physical activity, not to the point of exhaustion, but enough to challenge the body.

Along with the good nutrition from the farm products, he also used to drink liters of ice-cold spring water, which is rich with minerals said to contribute to longevity.

The headache-inducing altitudes of mountains may also be a factor.

2017 study by the University of Navarra, Spain , found that living at high elevation decreases the risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes. A 2011 study by the University of Colorado Denver found that these sky-high residents also live longer

The ages of some of these celebrated centenarians may still be disputed, but here in Lerik their legacy lives on through the people that still abide by the simple secret of Lerik's longevity: physical activity, good nutrition, lots of water and an attitude to life that says: We only live once, but if we do it right, once is enough.",2020-07-14,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/long-life-lerik-azerbaijan-wellness/index.html
Pamela Boykoff,Jack Ma cashes out billions of dollars in Alibaba shares as stock booms,"New York (CNN Business) Alibaba founder Jack Ma has sold billions of dollars worth of his shares in the Chinese ecommerce company over the past year as its stock has skyrocketed by about 50%. Ma, one of China's richest people, cut his stake from 6.2% to 4.8%, according to the company's annual report.

The report did not say when Ma sold his shares or for how much. At the current market price, the stake would be worth about $8.2 billion. Ma retired last year as the company's executive chairman at the age of 55 and said he would devote his time to philanthropy.

Alibaba BABA In May,said its digital platforms now account for one-sixth of all retail sales in China and it expected to grow even more as the Covid-19 pandemic drove more consumers and business online.

Matt Egan,'It's going to be really ugly.' Here come the big bank earnings,"New York (CNN Business) Mass unemployment . Surging bankruptcies. An unprecedented health crisis. And near-zero interest rates. It's a depressing time for America's banks -- and Wall Street is bracing for huge profit plunges when they report results this week.

, Bank of America andare all expected to reveal their second-quarter profits crashed by 50% or more.is likely to slash its coveted dividend and announce the scandal-ridden bank's first quarterly loss since the financial crisis.

""2020 has been a disaster,"" said Jim Shanahan, who covers banks at Edward Jones. ""It wasn't the banks' fault. It was like we had an alien invasion in the second quarter.""

The biggest driver of shrinking profits -- or outright losses, in Wells Fargo's case -- is the fact that banks are preparing to deal with a pile of toxic loans caused by the pandemic.

During the first quarter,, JPMorgan, Citi, Wells Fargo andhave collectively set aside an additional $35 billion to cushion against loans that go bust.

$2.1 trillion in credit losses

Analysts agree that banks will be forced to further increase loss-absorbing reserves -- but the real question is by how much.

""It's going to be really ugly,"" said Kyle Sanders, also a banking analyst at Edward Jones.

S&P Global Ratings warned last week that banks around the world will ultimately suffer credit losses of about $2.1 trillion between this year and next.

Beyond bankruptcies and high unemployment, bank profitability is getting crushed by extremely low interest rates. Banks make money off the spread between interest charged on loans and what is paid out on deposits. Right now, that spread is very narrow, making it challenging to make money.

Worse, the Federal Reserve has signaled zero interest rates aren't going away anytime soon.

""Core earnings power is still a challenge in a ZIRP [zero interest rate policy] world,"" Jefferies analyst Ken Usdin wrote in a note to clients last week.

KBW Bank Index BKX That's why bank stocks have been slammed this year. Thehas lost more than one-third of its value this year, badly trailing the 2% drop for the S&P 500 in 2020.

Wells Fargo's first dividend cut in a decade

Among the big banks, Wells Fargo is the biggest loser, with its stock down a whopping 54% so far this year. Last month, Wells Fargo warned it will likely cut its dividend for the first time since the Great Recession.

Indeed, Wells Fargo is the only major bank expected to swing to a loss during the second quarter, a point that underscores just how much it was struggling even before the pandemic.

The problem for Wells Fargo is that it has fewer financial levers to pull than its peers.

Unlike its rivals, Wells Fargo can't make more loans to offset low interest rates. That's because Wells Fargo is still prohibited by the Federal Reserve from growing its balance sheet (except to make small business loans under the federal government's Paycheck Protection Program).

And Wells Fargo can't cut costs too deeply because its scandals have forced it to ramp up spending on compliance and technology.

Wells Fargo isn't the only big bank with a shrinking stock price. JPMorgan, Bank of America and Citigroup have all lost about one-third of their market value this year.

PNC PNC Super-regional banksand US Bancorp have seen their share prices plunge by around 40% apiece. Both are expected to post steep profit declines this week.

Greed is making a comeback

The bright spot in the banking industry has been the investment banks because they are cashing in on resurgent capital markets.

Goldman Sachs GS Morgan Stanley MS is only down 12% on the year.is off just 5%. Both firms, which rely more on Wall Street than Main Street for the bulk of their profits, are expected to post more modest earnings declines than their rivals.

The pandemic caused capital markets to freeze up in March, but the Federal Reserve has engineered a massive rebound. It helps that the Fed is, for the first time ever, directing the purchase of corporate debt , including junk bonds

Investment banks also are hauling in fees ties to a surge of stock sales and IPOs, including debuts in recent months by software firm ZoomInfo , Albertsons and online insurer Lemonade . US companies raised nearly $190 billion via stock sales during the second quarter -- the most on Dealogic records going back to 1995.

Resurgent pandemic means more credit losses

Beyond navigating turbulent markets, banks are also grappling with rising coronavirus infections in Sun Belt states including Texas, Arizona and Florida. And big banks have enormous exposure to coronavirus hotspots.

Bank of America had $591 billion in deposits in the top 50 counties across the United States that have seen the most new coronavirus infections over the last month, according to a Morgan Stanley analysis. JPMorgan ($427 billion), Wells Fargo ($389 billion) and US Bancorp ($151 billion) followed as the banks with the most exposure in dollar amounts to these counties.

The health crisis in those areas and risk of renewed restrictions will cause ""increased stress"" for local businesses and potentially greater credit losses for banks, Morgan Stanley said.

Chris Isidore,"Ford pressured to stop selling police cars, but it won't get out of the business","New York (CNN Business) Ford CEO Jim Hackett rejected employees' calls to get out of the police car business, saying the automaker can support the Black Lives Matter movement while selling the majority of America's police cars.

Ford F Hackett, in a recent memo to staff, acknowledged that someemployees are urging the company to stop making police cars because of a series of high-profile killings of Black Americans by police. A public petition on Change.org has also gathered about 12,000 signatures over the last month, urging Ford to refuse sales and service of cars to police departments ""using violent tactics.""

The police car that George Floyd was lying next to when he was killed was a Ford. The Ford Interceptor is widely acknowledged as the nation's best-selling police vehicle vehicle, although Ford has not broken out the number of vehicles it has sold. There are no firm figures on its market share, but industry experts believe it to be in the 60% range.

Hackett said the automaker opposes police misconduct.

""It should be clear both [Chairman] Bill Ford and I believe deeply that there is no room for the systemic repression and racism that have been exhibited by law enforcement encounters gone wrong,"" Hackett said in the memo late last month, which became public this week. ""We've said clearly that Black Lives Matter. We do believe strongly that more transparency and accountability is required in police operations.""

Bill Weir,Rising seas are turning Miami's high ground into hot property,"Miami (CNN) In a city where ""sunny day floods"" increased 400% in a decade, rising seas are changing the old real estate mantra of ""location, location, location.""

In Miami these days, it's all about elevation, elevation, elevation.

And long before melted ice caps wash over Ocean Drive, one of America's most vulnerable big cities is becoming a test case for the modern problem of climate gentrification.

While some scientific models predict enough polar ice melt to bring at least 10 feet of sea level rise to South Florida by 2100, just a modest 12 inches would make 15% of Miami uninhabitable, and much of that beachside property is among America's most valuable.

Even now, as more frequent ""king tides"" bubble up through Florida's porous limestone, pushing fish through sewers and onto streets, residents are becoming more aware that their city is built on the rippling shelves, ridges and canyons of a fossil seabed.

""Water is simply going back to the same places it flowed ages ago,"" says Sam Purkis, Chair of the University of Miami's Geosciences Department. ""The irony is what happened 125,000 years ago is going to dictate what happens to your house now.""

The fickle undulations between city blocks could mean the difference between survival and retreat, and the rising cost of altitude is sparking a noticeable shift in community activism and municipal budgets.

In Pinecrest, artist Xavier Cortada installed murals showing how many feet above sea level intersections are.

Neighbors in Pinecrest formed America's first Underwater Homeowners Association (complete with elevation yard signs) and named a marine scientist as president.

Miami Beach is spending millions elevating roads, upgrading pumps and changing building codes to allow residents to raise their mansions by five feet.

But in working-class, immigrant neighborhoods like Little Haiti, year-to-year sea level rise gets lost in the day-to-day struggle, and most had no idea that they live a lofty three feet higher than the wealthy folks on Miami Beach.

They found out when developers started calling, from everywhere.

""They were calling from China, from Venezuela. Coming here with cases of money!"" says Marleine Bastien, a community organizer and longtime resident. ""We used to think that the allure of Little Haiti was the fact that it's close to downtown, close to both airports and close to the beach. Unbeknownst to us, it's because we are positioned at a higher altitude.""

Pointing out a row of vacant shops, she ticks off the names of a dozen small business owners she says have been forced out by rising rents, and lists others who she says unwittingly took lowball offers with no understanding of Miami's housing crisis.

""If you sell your home in Little Haiti, you think that you're making a big deal, and it's only after you sell, and then you realize, 'Oh, I cannot buy anywhere else.'""

Marleine Bastien, center, protests with residents and activists against the Magic City plans.

After her community center and day school were priced out of three different buildings, she caught wind of plans to build the sprawling $1 billion Magic City development on the edge of Little Haiti, featuring a promenade, high-end retail stores, high rise apartments and imagined by a consortium of local investors, including the founder of Cirque du Soleil.

Magic City developers insist that they picked the site based on location, not elevation.

A view of downtown Miami and South Beach from a plane shows the oceanfront development of the past.

They promised to preserve the soul of Little Haiti and give $31 million to the community for affordable housing and other programs, but it wasn't enough for Bastien. ""This is a plan to actually erase Little Haiti,"" she says. ""Because this is the one place where immigration and climate gentrification collide.""

She fought the development with all the protesters and hand-lettered signs she could muster, but after a debate that went until 1 a.m., commissioners approved the permit with a 3-0 vote at the end of June.

""The area we took was all industrial,"" says Max Sklar, VP with Plaza Equity Partners and a member of the development team. ""There was no real thriving economy around these warehouses or vacant land. And so our goal is to create that economy.

""Can we appease everybody? Not 100%, that's not feasible. It's not realistic. But we've listened to them.""

He repeats a promise to deliver $6 million to a Little Haiti community trust before ground is even broken and, as a sign that he listened to at least one demand, acknowledges that the complex will now be called Magic City Little Haiti.

But while Bastien mourns the defeat, her neighbor and fellow organizer Leonie Hermantin welcomes the investment and hopes for the best. ""Even if Magic City did not come today, the pace of gentrification is so rapid that our people will not be able to afford homes here anyways,"" she says with a resigned head shake. ""Magic City is not the government. Affordable housing policies have to come from the government.""

A woman uses an umbrella for shade as she walks on a hot day in Miami.

""(Climate gentrification) is something that we are very closely monitoring,"" Miami Mayor Francis Suarez tells me. ""But we haven't seen any direct evidence of it yet.""

Suarez is the rare Republican who passionately argues for climate mitigation plans and helped champion the $400 million Miami Forever bond, approved by voters to fund action to protect the city from the ravages of higher seas and stronger storms.

Miami Mayor Francis Suarez championed a plan to tackle the impact of the climate crisis.

""We actually created in our first tranche of Miami Forever, a sustainability fund for people to renovate their homes so that they can stay in their properties rather than having to sell their properties,"" he says.

But that fund is a relatively small $15 million, not enough to dent a housing crisis that grows with each heat wave and hurricane, in a city where over a quarter of residents live below the poverty level.

What's happening in Little Haiti could be just one example of a ""climate apartheid"" that the United Nations warns is ahead , where there will be a gulf between the rich who can protect themselves from the impact of climate change and the poor who are left behind.

Philip Alston, the UN Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, said there was already evidence of how the climate crisis affects the rich and poor differently.

And he pointed out that those hurt most were likely those least responsible. ""Perversely, while people in poverty are responsible for just a fraction of global emissions, they will bear the brunt of climate change, and have the least capacity to protect themselves,"" Alston wrote last month.",2019-07-11,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/07/11/us/miami-little-haiti-climate-gentrification-weir-wxc/index.html
Stephanie Bailey,Climate change: How rich people could help save the planet,"(CNN) Rich people don't just have bigger bank balances and more lavish lifestyles than the rest of us -- they also have bigger carbon footprints.

The more stuff you own, and the more you travel, the more fossils fuels are burned, and the more greenhouse gases are emitted into the atmosphere.

Jetting around, buying luxury goods, keeping mansions warm and driving supercars -- they all have a carbon footprint.

Oxfam has estimated that the average carbon footprint of someone in the world's richest 1% could be 175 times that of someone in the poorest 10%. Studies also show that the poor suffer the most from climate change

But some argue that the wealthy can do the most to help fix the climate crisis. Here's how they could make a difference.

Spend wisely

The buying decisions of the rich mean much more in the fight against climate change than those of most people.

Ilona Otto and her colleagues at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research estimated that the typical ""super-rich"" household of two people (which they defined as having net assets of more than $1 million, excluding their main home) has a carbon footprint of 129 tons of CO2 a year. That's around 65 tons of CO2 a year per person, which is over 10 times the global average.

Otto noted that because the sample in the study was small, the numbers are illustrative. ""Probably our estimates are even lower than the true emissions of millionaires,"" she said.

""Regarding their own lifestyle choices, the rich can change a lot,"" said Otto. ""For instance, putting solar panels on the roofs of their houses. They can also afford electric cars and the best would be if they avoided flying.""

In the study, air travel accounted for more than half of the footprint of a super-rich couple.

German architects Aktivhaus say this home generates twice as much energy as it consumes.

Rich people also have more flexibility to make changes.

""A high-income consumer likely has access and is able to afford more climate-friendly products or produce from local farmers,"" said Tom Bailey, who contributed to a new report that highlights consumption in high-income cities.

""High-income cities and high-income individuals also have the resources to trial new products, services and solutions,"" he explained, adding that they have the capacity to create a market for more sustainable goods.

Divestment

As well as choosing what to spend money on, rich people can choose what industries to invest in -- or not to invest in.

Oxfam estimates that the number of billionaires on the Forbes list with business interests in the fossil fuel sector rose from 54 in 2010 to 88 in 2015, and the size of their fortunes expanded from over $200 billion to more than $300 billion.

Steam rises from a coal-fired power plant in Germany.

But there's a trend of wealthy investors selling their shares in climate-harming industries, known as divestment.

Over 1,100 organizations and 59,000 individuals, with combined assets totaling $8.8 trillion, have pledged to divest from fossil fuels through the online movement DivestInvest

Among them is Hollywood actor Leonardo DiCaprio , who signed the pledge on behalf of himself and his environment foundation -- as well as a group of 22 affluent individuals from the Netherlands who pledged to remove their personal wealth from the top 200 oil, gas and coal companies.

""You don't invest in coal, you don't invest in oil, in gas, also in some car companies that produce normal cars, or aviation, so you direct the financial flows,"" said Otto.

And with divestment, a little can go a long way. ""We did some simulations that shows that with the divestment movement you don't need everyone to divest,"" said Otto. ""If the minority of investors divest, the other investors will not invest in those fossil fuel assets because they will be afraid of losing money ... even if they have no environmental concerns.""

Wealth means power

Wealthy people are not just economic decision makers, they can have political influence too. They can fund political parties and campaigns and have access to lawmakers.

Otto argued that rich people could use their political power to instigate positive changes to climate policy.

""Those people with the highest emissions, they have the highest agency to change something,"" said Otto. ""There's so much research about the poor, the impact of climate change on the poor ... sustainable development goals and so on. But when it comes to action and sustainability and transformation, the poor cannot do anything because they are busy surviving.

""But the educated, the rich and the super-rich -- it's a completely different case. They have the money and the resources to act and they also have the social networks,"" she explained.

Fund climate research

The wealthy can also support climate research. In 2015, Microsoft founder Bill Gates committed $2 billion of his fortune to fund research and development into clean energy.

In May, a group of scientists wrote to 100 wealthy charities and families in the UK to ask for an ""extraordinary increase"" in funding for environmental and climate-related issues.

""We implore you to urgently consider significant investment to prevent further ecological catastrophe -- whether through your personal investments or your philanthropy,"" the letter said.

There's plenty of incentive for the wealthy to demand climate action: A recent UN report warned that delaying climate policies will cost the world's top companies $1.2 trillion over the next 15 years.

Role models

The super-rich might also have an influence on other people's carbon emissions.

""High status in our societies remains associated with high material wealth,"" said Otto. ""It's an aspiration to become like the very wealthy and you imitate the lifestyles of people who you want to be like.""

For example, air travel is no longer only a treat of the super-rich. This year, budget airline Ryanair was the only non-coal plant among Europe's top 10 emitters.

Ryanair is among the EU's biggest greenhouse gas emitters, according to EU data. The rankings include power stations, manufacturing plants and aviation.

""We as a society have to search for new ways of leading 'rich' lives that are independent of material wealth,"" said Stephanie Moser, of the University of Bern, in Switzerland, who found that a person's carbon footprint is better indicated by their income than their environmental beliefs.

""We have to redefine wealth in our societies such that living a ""good life"" is possible without high greenhouse gas emissions,"" she said.",2019-07-12,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/07/12/health/rich-people-climate-change-intl/index.html
Oscar Holland,Vintage photos show British vacationers gone wild,"Written by Oscar Holland, CNN

Butlin's vacation resorts were an institution in post-war Britain. The self-contained camps -- where guests were housed in wooden chalets, fed and entertained on-site -- provided a new kind of inexpensive luxury for working families.

At a time when few could afford overseas travel, the resorts offered ""a week's holiday for a week's pay,"" as they were first advertised.

Beyond the likelihood of rain, Butlin's summer vacations were a uniquely British proposition.

Exuberant in-house entertainers, known as Redcoats, hosted singalongs, pantomimes and rounds of bingo. They held ""glamorous grandmother"" competitions, and ""knobbly knees"" contests to see which guest had the lumpiest legs. Ringo Starr's band (no, not that one) even played residencies there in the early 1960s, before he was invited to join the Beatles.

By the time photographer Barry Lewis arrived in the 1980s, however, the camps were ""getting a little bit seedy,"" as he put it.

There were fewer families and more singles, with plenty of sex and alcohol mixed in with the entertainment, Lewis said. But the 71-year-old still recalls the resorts' glamorous early reputation.

""When I was a kid, Butlin's was seen as very grand, but my parents could never afford to go,"" he said in a phone interview. ""It was made to sound amazing -- you'd have top stars performing, everything was free and there were fairgrounds.""

Launched by Billy Butlin in 1936, the camps' initial popularity was bolstered by the UK government's Holidays with Pay Act, which gave workers the right to paid leave for the first time. A site was opened in Skegness, on Britain's east coast, though more than half a dozen more would be built in British seaside towns over the next three decades.

The camps boomed after World War II, welcoming more than a million annual visitors in their mid-1960s heyday. Upon taking a teenage summer job at a Butlin's kitchen in 1966, Lewis found them to be ""enclosed, hermetic worlds"" equipped with theaters, recreation halls, ballrooms, pools, funfairs, boating lakes, hair salons and even churches.

""You were in this enclosed system,"" he recounted. ""You went to this other world. Russia could have invaded America and we wouldn't even have known about it -- there were no TVs in the chalets.

""But there was actually something wonderful about it. You felt you'd joined this weird club. It was very clever in making you feel (as if you were) part of a family.""

Warts and all

Lewis' teenage experiences hint at the wilder behavior he would later encounter. This ""enclosed fantasy world"" (as the photographer describes it in his new book ) was also equipped with bars, discos and betting shops.

""I served breakfasts and learned about becoming a man. I was desperate to fall in love, and all the stuff that goes with leaving home for the first time,"" he said, adding that he often ""served breakfast on a hangover"" after late-night attempts to meet women. ""To be completely frank, I was trying to get laid most of the time.""

After going on to university and establishing himself as a professional photographer, Lewis returned to Butlin's in 1982 on assignment for the UK's Observer newspaper. Then aged 34, he was initially astonished at how little had changed.

Many of his images are alive with the communality and good cheer he'd remembered -- kids enjoying activities and parents singing and dancing in the entertainment halls. But things, he said, had become more salacious.

""There was a whole sex thing that was never really talked about. A lot of people went there to get laid, so there was quite a lot of sexism,"" Lewis said. ""Alcohol was the drug of choice and people got hammered. Absolutely.

""If you were trying to be part of the gang, you drank with (the Redcoats). They were young lads, but they were adored and they loved that.""

The photographer's fondness for the camps is nonetheless apparent (he describes the images as ""warts and all, but in a loving way""). He took an immersive approach to the assignment -- which meant partying and drinking with the other campers. ""That's how we worked,"" he said, referring to the journalist he accompanied, Ian Walker. ""We'd integrate ourselves.""

Yet, Lewis also acknowledges there was a certain ""darkness"" to it all.

An image from the book shows a Redcoat pinching a female guest's breast. Another shows male judges keeping an uncomfortably close eye on a participant in a ""miss lovely leg"" contest. Elsewhere, an employee is pictured asleep on the lobby floor after a heavy night, while Walker wrote in the Observer at the time that ""two skinheads started smashing up glasses,"" in a resort bar in the early hours.

An unlikely renaissance

In one of Lewis' most striking photos, he captured a man frozen mid-air just before splashing into an outdoor pool. Huge letters behind spell out one of the camps' slogans: ""Our true intent is all for your delight.""

That Billy Butlin might use a quote from ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" speaks of his lofty ambitions for the resorts. But in the 1980s, the glamour was fading. Package trips to Europe had become affordable, dampening the prestige of domestic vacations. Butlin's went into economic decline, and a number of its camps closed in the years that followed.

Yet, if the Butlin's of the 1980s differed from that of previous decades, then today's is perhaps less recognizable still. The company has since changed owners and rebranded itself, its resorts fitted with new water parks and subjected to multi-million-dollar expansions. As such, the camps are undergoing something of a renaissance, Lewis ventured.

""I think, now, it's booming again,"" he said. ""With Brexit coming up, and the currency weakened -- and also with Covid-19 -- people aren't going to travel abroad as much.

""There is something nice about not having to think about (your vacation). You just book and that's it, whereas a lot of trips are just full of planning. People like that everything's laid on.""

In a statement to CNN, Butlin's said: ""Butlin's has always been a family brand and we've been delighting families for decades. We can't wait until we can reopen our resorts and welcome our guests back to Butlin's for a much needed holiday.""",2020-07-14,https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/barry-lewis-butlins/index.html
Tamara Hardingham-Gill,What it's like to visit a country that doesn't officially exist,"(CNN) — They have their own governments, passports, citizens and even currency in some cases.

But for various complicated reasons, a number of countries around the world do not officially exist -- some are even left off maps.

That didn't stop Guilherme Canever trying to visit them. The Brazilian author traveled to 16 unrecognized nations between 2009 and 2014 and recounts his experiences in his latest book ""Unrecognized Nations: Travels To Countries That Do Not Exist,"" which is released this month.

Although the definition of a country is open to interpretation, to be considered as such under International Law , a territory needs to have a permanent population, a defined territory and border controls, the ability to govern itself independently and relations with other countries.

The final hurdle is gaining recognition as a state by the United Nations, which comes with a number of benefits such as having more access to economic networks.

Those that aren't recognized by the UN are not formally acknowledged as countries, even if they're recognized by other nations, and can face many struggles as a result.

Canever became fascinated with disputed countries after visiting Somaliland, an aspiring country located in the Horn of Africa that has sought independence from Somalia since 1991.

""I was traveling through Africa by land in 2009 and ended up going to Somaliland,"" he tells CNN Travel. ""I was shocked when I realized I couldn't use Somali money there. Then I started to understand this was a nation with its own institutions, laws and currency.

""But it wasn't recognized by any other country. It felt like I was in a parallel universe.""

Despite unilaterally declaring independence from Somalia in 1991, Somaliland has never been recognized as a sovereign nation by any other country.

Fighting for recognition

Somaliland hasn't been recognized as a sovereign nation by any other country. Guilherme Canever

This has made things particularly difficult for the territory, which has faced serious economic troubles over the years.

""Somaliland is really on its own,"" explains Canever. ""They've struggled to survive because they have no allies.""

Unemployment is high here, as are illiteracy rates, but he was extremely impressed by the resilience of its locals.

""They spoke about their struggles,"" Canever adds. ""Many are dependent on the money that people working abroad sent them.

""Because they are not recognized [as a country,] it's very difficult to make exchanges with other countries.

""It's very hard for them to sell anything. So a lot of the people take the opportunity to work in other countries.

""It's a very difficult situation. But I can see they're improving a lot.""

In the years that followed his trip to Somaliland, Canever began to research other destinations with similar issues.

After narrowing it down to 10 independent territories with limited international recognition and six autonomous regions that were previously independent or would like to be, he started planning his extensive trip.

One of the most well known disputed countries on his hit list was Kosovo, which lies in the Balkans region of Europe.

While Somaliland has suffered from a lack of allies, Kosovo has benefited from its many supporters.

Since Kosovo formally declared independence from Serbia in 2008 -- a decision strongly opposed by Serbia, which was backed by Russia -- it's been recognized as an independent state by more than 100 countries, as well as the International Olympic Committee.

But UN member status has eluded the territory.

Unlike some of the other disputed countries, Kosovo attracts a large number of tourists, with the majority of foreign visitors coming from Albania, Turkey and Germany.

""Kosovo has the support of a lot of wealthy countries and many tourists come here,"" says Canever.

In 2018, the number of international visitors to the partially recognized state increased by 19% over the previous year.

""You can see it's developing, but there are a lot of small problems that still need to be resolved before they can become fully independent,"" he adds.

Pain of division

Northern Cyprus isn't recognized as an independent country by any other country but Turkey. Guilherme Canever

Canever used global homestay and social networking service Couchsurfing during his trip in order to connect with locals and gain a deeper understanding of what it's like to be from a place that's existence is questioned.

""One of the things I liked most about traveling to these [unrecognized] countries is that the interactions with the locals is very unique,"" he says.

""It doesn't feel like they're providing a service to a tourist. The tourist really becomes part of the community.

""They open up their houses to you and allow you to take part in activities with them.""

He believes this is due to a combination of genuine friendliness and curiosity.

""If it's a place that not many tourists go to, sometimes they are curious and want to know how the rest of the world sees them.

""Most of these countries are very proud. Some of the people believe they're better off than those in the outside world.""

During his trip to Cyprus, which has been divided since the Turkish military invasion in 1974 backed by the Greek government, Canever witnessed first hand the level of pain this bitter separation has caused.

While Turkey recognizes the area that comprises the northeastern part of the island as the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, to the rest of the world it's the Turkish-occupied territory of the Republic of Cyprus.

""As soon as you cross the border, you can see the difference,"" Canever says of his trip to Northern Cyprus.

""I stayed with a man who told me his father was born in Turkey and his mother is Turkish Cypriot.

""He could not cross to the southern part of the island because he is considered Turkish, not Turkish Cypriot. It was really difficult for him.

""It's very hard for the younger generation.""

Proud citizens

Canever also spent time in Tibet, the remote territory known as the ""roof of the world."" Guilherme Canever

Abkhazia and South Ossetia, the two disputed territories in the Caucasus, were also on his itinerary.

The former, a breakaway region of Georgia with strong ties to Russia, left a particularly strong impression on Canever.

""Abkhazia is a beautiful place,"" he says of the region, which is bordered by over 200 kilometers of Black Sea coastline. ""It has lots of beautiful monasteries.

""It's not what you'd expect of a country that doesn't exist. A lot of Russians go there during the summer for the beaches.

""They have quite a big tourist industry. You can buy souvenirs like fridge magnets and T-shirts there.""

However, the process of entering the self-declared sovereign state was far from simple.

""You have to contact them by email [for an entry permit ] and they give you a set day for when you can go in [to get authorization],"" he explains.

""Then as soon as you enter the country, you have go to the the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to collect an official visa.""

According to Canever, the people of Abkhazia didn't seem particularly concerned with being recognized internationally.

""They were very, very nationalistic,"" he explains. ""They got very emotional [when they talked about the country]. They would say that, as Russia supports them, they didn't need the recognition of Europe or the US.""

Over in the South Caucasus lies Nagorno-Karabakh -- also known as the Republic of Artsakh. Like various other disputed countries, Nagorno-Karabakh is at the center of a long-running conflict between two nations. In this case, it's Armenia and Azerbaijan.

""Stepanakert [the capital of Nagorno-Karabakh] is easy to go to from Armenia,"" Canever says. ""It's very peaceful. There are pretty squares surrounded by flowers where people sit and have drinks.

""But the line of conflict is just a few kilometers away. Sometimes there are still exchanges of gunfire, so there's a lot of tension.""

The area is home to a number of pretty churches and monasteries, such as the Gandzasar Monastery.

""There are also beautiful mountains and a lot of places you can visit safely,"" adds Canever.

South Ossetia, a mountainous territory between Georgia and Russia that's officially part of the former, is seemingly less of a tourist draw.

""Not many people go there,"" he says.

Canever also visited Transnistria, based between Moldova and Ukraine, which declared its independence in 1990, a year before the fall of the Soviet Union.

Official recognition beckoning?

Western Sahara -- a non-self-governing territory. Guilherme Canever

But despite having its own currency and border controls, the territory is yet to be recognized by the UN. Canever was able to access the country via Moldova.

""To travel there you have to change your money into Transnistrian ruble,"" he says, explaining he was initially skeptical of how efficient things would be here.

""Pretty much all of its institutions work. I even tried to check how well they work buying a postcard and sending it home to see if it would arrive, and it did.

""It was quite interesting to see that some of these places do have full control of their territory.""

Although South Sudan became the newest recognized country in the world in 2011, there's been little to suggest any of the other aspiring countries will be granted that same privilege any time soon.

While he certainly doesn't claim to be an expert on boundary disputes, Canever says his experiences and the extensive research undertaken while writing the book have shown him that creating new border lines and countries aren't necessarily the best way to solve problems in lands.

""Most of these countries began as minorities that were having problems and wanted to be independent,"" he explains.

""But as soon as they get their independence, they become the majority, and there are still minorities in their land that need to be protected.

Maggie Hiufu Wong,Japan debuts new bullet train that can run during an earthquake,"(CNN) — Japan's latest record-breaking bullet train doesn't only run faster and smoother -- it's also able to transport passengers to safety in the event of an earthquake.

The N700S -- the 'S' stands for 'Supreme' -- entered into service July 1 and serves the Tokaido Shinkansen line, which links Tokyo Station and Shin-Osaka Station in Osaka.

It can run up to 360 kilometers per hour, a new record set during a test run in 2019, making it one of the fastest trains in the world. The operating speed, however, will be capped at 285 kilometers per hour.

It's the first new bullet train model to be added to the Tokaido Shinkansen line by the Central Japan Railway (JR Central) in 13 years, a launch that was originally timed to coincide with the Tokyo Olympics in 2020 -- now postponed to 2021

Coincidentally, Japan inaugurated the Tokaido Shinkansen line in 1964, connecting Tokyo and Osaka, just in time for the Summer Olympics in Tokyo that same year. It was the world's first high speed railway line.

Cutting-edge technology

Appearance-wise, the N700S doesn't look too different from the older N700 or N700A models, apart from its elegant golden logo.

But look closer and you'll see the brand-new train has a more angular nose, chubbier ""cheeks"" and sleeker headlight design.

On the inside, newly designed seats allow passengers to recline further, offering more comfort, especially for long-haul riders. Each seat has an individual power outlet.

Interior lighting has been designed to create a softer, more relaxing atmosphere. The overhead baggage racks will be lit up at each stop to remind passengers of their belongings.

More reservation-only storage areas for extra-large luggage have been added to this model as well.

The actual ride will be a lot quieter and smoother, too, thanks to a new active suspension system that helps absorb train movements.

In addition to a focus on increased comfort, designers behind the new model put great emphasis on safety.

The train has an upgraded automatic control and braking system that allows it to halt faster in case of an emergency.

It's also fitted with lithium-ion battery self-propulsion system -- the first of its kind in the world. This system allows the train to run for a short distance on its own during a power outage and will make it possible for it to move to a safer location at low speed if stranded in a high-risk area -- on a bridge or in a tunnel, for example -- during an earthquake.

More cameras have also been installed inside car compartments -- an increase from two cameras to up to six in each train car.

The upgraded components will take up less space under the train floor compared to the old model, making it possible for a more flexible configuration, from four to 16 cars. This also decreases energy consumption while speeding up production times, making it a more appealing option for operators internationally.

""By making the mechanisms under the floor of the N700S lighter and more compact, we created a new standard,"" Masayuki Ueno, deputy head of JR Central's bullet train business department, told Japanese broadcaster NHK in an interview in 2019",2020-07-14,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/japan-new-shinkansen-model-n700s/index.html
Nathan Kay,Lake Balaton and the endless summers of Hungary's communist riviera,"(CNN) — During the communist era, travel options were limited in Hungary and Central Europe, which meant Lake Balaton became the region's most popular vacation destination.

Now, with the world gripped by the coronavirus pandemic, this large lake in western Hungary has once again become a popular holiday spot for people from all over Europe.

Lake Balaton means as much to Hungarians as the Riviera does to Westerners. Its popularity in recent years has skyrocketed, earning itself the nickname ""The Hamptons of Hungary,"" a nod to the summer retreats on Long Island favored by wealthy New Yorkers.

The freshwater oasis is home to a picturesque 197-kilometer shoreline with public and private beaches, underwater cave galleries, volcanic hills, ancient fortresses and even a villa named after Fidel Castro.

Siófok, on the southern bank, provides an array of bars and clubs for the younger crowd while the north shore is a little more sophisticated, with spas, vineyards and historic towns.

Back in communist times, Lake Balaton was quite a different place but still maintained a cool, elegant vibe which even now evokes vivid memories for Hungarians of all ages. It also offered a rare meeting place for East and West German families divided by the Iron Curtain.

Trade union travel

Mária Dudás, 93, a retired teacher from Bernecebaráti, Hungary, has fond memories of her trips to Balaton which stretch right back to the beginning of the communist era.

She recalls that the visitors she encountered at the lake were almost exclusively the families of Hungarian trade unions, who were entitled to two weeks' vacation.

""The trade union gave us a list of which resorts had free rooms and people could choose where they wanted to go,"" she says. ""It cost just 250 forints (80 cents) per person for two weeks, which was unbelievably cheap even then.

""We had three meals per day in the restaurant, but the resort assigned seating. We couldn't just sit where we wanted.""

Dudás's granddaughter Luca tells quite a different story.

""When I hear the stories from my grandparents and think of how it is today, it really hits home how wonderful a place it is with endless opportunities for all generations, at all times,"" she says.

""My grandmother told me that they had some nights out, with music and dance; and the families they clicked with became friends that met every year. There wasn't a great deal to do, but it was their holiday time and they really enjoyed it.

""We have parties now, but our options are more varied. You can go to a party in Siófok, dance at the pop music or techno festivals in Zamárdi, learn about its history at Festetics Castle in Keszthely, taste wine in Badacsony, harvest lavender in Tihany or take out a sailing boat at Balatonfüred.""

The best-kept secret

Many people have fond memories of their summers at the lake. Fortepan / Ferencvárosi Helytörténeti Gyűjtemény

Dudás tells CNN Travel that the best-kept secret in Lake Balaton was the Communist party resort in Balatonaliga -- Club Aliga. The resort compound was closed to the public until the regime change in 1989 as the Soviet-backed Eastern Bloc collapsed.

""It became the party resort in 1948 and had two areas, one for party members and workers and the other for the MSZMP Party,"" she said, referring to the Hungarian Socialist Workers Party.

She reels off a list of high-ranking foreign guests, including former Soviet leaders Nikita Khrushchev and Leonid Brezhnev, cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, East German leader Erich Honecker and Fidel Castro, who later gave his name to the resort's Villa Castro.

Today, Club Aliga is going through extensive renovation works and up until recently was a popular retro nightclub. From the porch, there's a wonderful panorama of Lake Balaton, from where you can see the body of water's entire eastern basin from Balatonkenese to Tihany.

Party time

György Szilágyi, 64, a property investor from Budapest, was born during the onset of the communist era in 1956. It was all he knew up until the regime change in 1989. He has nothing but fond memories of his time at the lake.

""I knew that every few years it was 'Balaton time' and it was going to be fun,"" he says. ""It was almost like a privilege.

""If you didn't have a friend or relative living there, you could count on your employer, which, in most cases, was practically the state.

""State-sponsored companies had built those typical concrete blockhouses and resort complexes that still stand witness to the communist era. The whole thing was so organized, you would be surprised.""

From the 1950s through to the 1980s, Lake Balaton was also extremely popular with German families and friends divided by the Berlin Wall. Due to this long and respected tradition, Germans still make up the main visitor numbers to the lake each year.

""It was full of Germans! It probably still is,"" says Szilágyi. ""They really seemed to love the place. It was a lot more affordable than it is now. Also, it was much more laid back, the atmosphere was somewhat more relaxed.""

Szilágyi recalls the cars of the communist era that would fill the roads leading up to Balaton.

Szilágyi's son Peter, with his tongue out, enjoys the Balaton Sound festival with friends. Courtesy Peter and György Szilágyi

""Picture this: The coast would be studded with old Wartburgs, Ladas and Trabants,"" he says. ""Maybe you'd see some nice Mercedes even. Those, of course, belonged to the West Germans, who came to hang out with their East German friends and family on the coast, effectively turning the 'Hungarian Sea' into the only possible meet-up location between the two worlds,"" he says.

""On the beach, most Hungarians would be eating what they brought from home, while those more fortunate would buy some lángos [Hungarian fried bread], corn on the cob or ice cream sticks.

""In the background, you might hear some Hungária [a Hungarian pop band] coming from an oddly colored VW Transporter. And you are there with your friends and family, doing the only thing you came here to do: sit back and enjoy the sun,"" he reminisces.

""Generally, and don't mistake me for a faithful communist for saying this, people seemed to have a lot more fun back in the old days.""

Szilágyi's son Peter, 27, also from Budapest, disagrees. He says that there are plenty of good times to be had at the lake today and parties are plenty, a standout being the Balaton Sound music festival.

""I think we have more fun now,"" he says. ""Balaton Sound is great! Take the classic Sziget Festival vibe, stir in some of the biggest names in contemporary electronic music, then place this mix on the coast of Lake Balaton -- that's how I could best describe the Balaton Sound feeling to someone who hasn't attended before.""

Peter also had fond childhood memories of summer vacations at the lake.

""We used to come together with the wider family circle near Balatonöszöd, in one of my aunties' vacation home,"" he says. ""This was the time of year when I got to spend a whole week with my cousins who lived far away.

""Typically, we used to wake up early, around 7 a.m. or so, and head to the beach to secure one of the few shady spots under the trees. Us kids always had loads of fun, but this was also a great opportunity to reconnect with our family.""

The change

Days on the beach were followed by dinner and socializing in the evening. Fortepan / Fortepan

Magdi Dorogi, 66, a retired secretary from Budapest, was one of the lucky few who were able to visit Lake Balaton as a child, an annual tradition that continued right up until what locals call ""the change,"" when communism ended and the resorts started to cater for international visitors.

""As a young adult, I first visited the southern shore of Lake Balaton in 1971, in Balatonlelle,"" she says. ""We went there with our friends and later my husband, in his first Zsiguli [a Soviet car brand]. We loved it because of its relaxed mood and vibe.""

Dorogi and her unmarried colleagues from Hungary's Quality Shoe Factory sidestepped rules that reserved Balaton breaks for families by bunking up with families who rented out spare rooms in their allotted accommodation to supplement incomes.

Days on the beach were followed by dinner and socializing in the evenings.

""At around 5 p.m. we went back to our accommodation, put ourselves in order, and then we went out to eat,"" she says.

""There was no mention of any expensive places. There was a 'thatched' dining room in Balatonlelle where we ate fish soup and several kinds of fried fish, then rinsed it down with a Balaton light beer.""

Lake Balaton meant a lot to Hungarians, but in the '60s and '70s, it belonged mainly to the people of Budapest. During these times, few companies had resorts on Lake Balaton, but it slowly started to open to a wider Hungary and then to international visitors during the 1980s.

""It has changed a lot over the years. A lot of nice hotels have now been built and it's become very popular,"" Dorogi adds. ""The northern shore is known as the so-called elite part while the south shore is cheaper and has a different vibe.""

Zoltán Molnár, 48, a successful entrepreneur from Budapest, says Lake Balaton is a love affair that starts in childhood and continues right through to the present day.

""As you grow you realize that it offers much more than just the water. Endless possibilities. Wine, food, culture,"" he says.

""My whole family has really fond memories of spending time at the lake in the '70s and '80s. It was such a great time for Hungarians during that era,"" he adds. ""We used to go to the lake for most of the summer each year and meet up with family and friends. These were taken at the tail end of the communist era, when everything started to change.""

""Lake Balaton is really starting to develop now. There are lots of opportunities for investment -- in property and business. It's also becoming a top European vacation destination once again and lots of people are visiting from all over the world. It's an exciting time for the people of Hungary!""

The 80 kilometer-long lake offers something for everyone -- it might sound like a cliché but happens to be true. The shallow waters on Balaton's south side draw family vacationers to the beaches while the Blue Ribbon Grand Prix sailing regatta, ongoing since 1936, attracts more than 500 boats annually and thousands of spectators to the northern shores.

The Balaton Sound music festival is one of Europe's largest open-air music events, which draws large crowds each summer -- although not this year.

There are also party boats, bungee jumping, and other activities.

VeszprémFest, also postponed until 2021, typically draws big-name performers and crowds in the summer. The Valley of Arts festival in Kapolcs is held at the end of July while the Paloznak Jazz picnic is also a big draw each year.

The hills atop Lake Balaton's north shore are home to many of Hungary's prime vineyards. Somló and Badacsony stand out with unique volcanic soils that help create bold and full-bodied whites. Balatonfüred produces a delicious Szürkebarát (like a Pinot Noir), and other regions produce world-beating wines that are used in the finest restaurants across the country.

The future

With travel habits now changing for people all over the world, local hotspots like Balaton have once again become thriving regional holiday destinations.

Large numbers descend upon the lake to take advantage of the water sports activities and to sunbathe on the beautifully kept beaches.

Outside of the water, Balaton is fast becoming a major music and arts attraction and is now Hungary's second-most important food and wine region after Budapest.

Lake Balaton is becoming so popular that the Hungarian government recently allocated $21 million for the modernization of the lake and its surrounding areas. The nearby Hévíz--Balaton Airport is currently in development to handle international flights, and new roads and railways are also being introduced.

Following the coronavirus crisis, even more money has been allocated to boost tourism and to encourage the people of the region to experience homegrown resorts. Various taxes have also been reduced to help the industry grow and prosper in these difficult times.",2020-07-14,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/hungary-lake-balaton-communist-riviera/index.html
Amani Al-Aidroos,EcoLoo: How a poop on Everest inspired a new type of toilet,"(CNN) How many of us have our best ideas on the toilet?

No really, it can happen. Take Zuraina Zaharin from Malaysia. She's built a business off the back of a loo break. Not just any loo break, of course. This one was near Everest in the early 2000s when she was climbing in the region -- and it was pretty bleak.

""I was facing this problem: the toilet,"" she explains. ""It's easy for men to do their business; they can just do it anywhere. But not for the ladies. We have to wait until we find some nice spot. Even then, I can't do it. I just have to find the toilet.""

Things didn't improve upon discovering the facilities, however. ""The last toilet at Everest base camp is a pit latrine,"" Zaharin continues. ""The smell, God knows... it's so stinky.""

Zaharin had traveled to the Himalayas, only to encounter ""a mountain of poop.""

Nathan Sing,The world through the eyes of one photographer,"(CNN) — Whether traveling through the vast floodplains of Africa or Thailand's lush mangrove forests, when photographer Michael Poliza explores the world, he practices one principle: take nothing but pictures and leave nothing but footprints.

Over the last two decades, Poliza has traveled to almost 180 countries to capture vibrant and spirited photos focused on intimate moments of animals and the world's least-documented landscapes.

Capturing these special moments requires patience and an understanding of the erratic rhythms of the wilderness, but even the most seasoned wildlife photographers are not immune to nature's whims.

One day in 2011, while soaring over Purnululu National Park in Western Australia, Poliza and his helicopter pilot were too absorbed by the beauty of its beehive-like rock formations to notice they were headed straight towards a storm.

""Lightning was coming down left and right and up and down, and I had an open door in the back of the helicopter which you cannot close, so the rain was coming in. It was pitch black,"" said Poliza.

It was, he remembers, a ""scary afternoon,"" but not a wasted one. As documented in his latest book ""The World,"" the combination of imposing edifices and bottled lightning is among his most stunning photography to date.

A man of reinvention

Poliza, now 62, wasn't always a photographer, starting as a child actor in his hometown of Hamburg, Germany, before founding multiple IT companies in the early internet boom. But in 1997, after more than a decade of transatlantic business trips, he sold his companies, packed up his things, and set out to explore the world.

He bought a 75-foot boat and embarked on a 1,009-day expedition around the world to raise environmental awareness, with photographers and filmmakers in tow. Together, they documented the journey, broadcasting photos via satellite and online as they explored remote areas of the world only reachable by ship.

During the trip, while searching for great white sharks in Australia, Poliza learned to appreciate that nature cannot be forced. After five days without a sighting, a friend of Poliza's was getting impatient and offered money to their guide to speed up the search. ""There was nothing he could do ... that was a very good lesson to understand that you cannot push nature to do anything.""

A new beginning

When his journey came to an end, Poliza, then in his mid-40s, was confronted with what to do next. He sold his ship and stopped in Cape Town, South Africa, on the way to Madagascar. Besotted, Poliza canceled his trip to Madagascar, bought a house in Cape Town, and began exploring the continent.

He joined his friends on safaris, capturing photos of Africa's spectacular landscapes and vast range of animals. When some of his photographs began appearing in advertisements, his career started to take off. ""I was just playing with my camera and trying to shoot things a bit different,"" said Poliza.

""To be honest, I didn't really have a plan ... I didn't wake up in the morning and say, 'I want to take a photo of wildlife or landscapes or a specific animal,' it just drifted into that.""

One day, after returning from a safari, Poliza realized he had a problem. ""I opened up my mail (and) I saw that my bank account wasn't smiling at me anymore. I realized I need to come up with a plan.""

He quickly found a publisher for his first book ""Africa,"" released in 2006, which gained worldwide attention. Poliza's photographs have filled a further 11 books, selling thousands of copies. His latest, "" The World ,"" published by teNeues , is the culmination of his work from the last decade.

""I realized that I had a lot of images that hadn't been used ... so I thought maybe it would be fun to do a book that is a subjective look at the world,"" Poliza said. ""I don't attempt to, and I don't pretend that my set of images covers the whole world. It's just my view of the world.""

No matter where he is, Poliza says it's imperative for him to travel light, support the local economy, and live among the locals. He has formed an emotional attachment to the landscapes, the wildlife, and the people of every place he has traveled to. As the effects of global climate change worsen, he hopes his photos inspire others to commit to saving the planet.

""What I'm trying to do is focus on the beautiful side of the world, and I think there's still a lot of beauty there,"" he says. ""I want people to ... create an emotional reaction with that area, with that place, with our planet, and are more willing to take responsibility that way.""",2020-07-14,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/michael-poliza-photographer-modern-explorers-intl/index.html
Sandee Lamotte,Meet the country that passes no law unless it improves citizens' well being,"(CNN) On the eastern edge of the Himalayas, nestled between India and Tibet, lies the tiny nation of Druk Yul, better known as Bhutan. In Bhutanese, the name means ""Land of the Thunder Dragon,"" a nod to the violent storms that pound the rugged mountain peaks and flood the lush valleys.

Bhutan is known as ""the last Shangri-La"" -- a remote Himalayan nation, rich in natural beauty and Buddhist culture, where national happiness is prioritized over economic growth.

Fiercely proud and protective of its traditions, Bhutan has been closed to outside influences for centuries. The nation only opened its doors to tourism in the 1970s and has decided to take a unique approach to westernization, creating a concept known as the ""Gross National Happiness Index.""

Don't be fooled by the name. This is not just a measure of how much people smile and laugh. It's a holistic approach to sustainable development that gives as much weight to human flourishing as it does wealth.

""We in Bhutan are very unique; our democracy is very, very unique ... in the sense we all are grounded very strongly by our national values,"" said Bhutan Prime Minister Dr. Lotay Tshering, who took office in November 2018. ""We do not put personal interest ahead of national interest.

""When we say Gross National Happiness, it is not the celebrative 'Ha ha -- Ho ho' kind of happiness that we look for in life,"" Lotay explained. ""It only means contentment, control of your mind, control of wants in your life. Don't be jealous with others, be happy with what you have, be compassionate, be a society where you can be more than happy to share.

""Our king rightly calls Gross National Happiness as development with values,"" Lotay continues. ""If the policy does not have a good amount of happiness index, if the policy is not every environment friendly, if the policy will not be able to ensure that it will result in the well-being of Bhutanese, that policy will never be approved in the country.""

Gross National Happiness

The Centre for Bhutan and GNH Studies is responsible for administering Bhutan's Gross National Happiness surveys. They ask questions such as ""How happy did you feel yesterday?"" and ""How often do you practice meditation?""

They measure nine key areas of happiness every five years -- psychological well-being, health, education, good governance, ecology, time use, community vitality, culture and living standards. Two surveys have been conducted so far, in 2010 and 2015, with another one due next year.

The house of a working farm sits in a valley nestled in the mountains near the eastern Bhutanese town of Paro.

The 2015 survey sampled more than 7,000 Bhutanese from across the country. It yielded some interesting results.

""The harder components like living standard, health, access to health or access to education and so on, they're improving in Bhutan,"" said Tshoki Zangmo, a researcher at the Centre.

""But the softer components like psychological well-being or the trust indicator that we have in our community vitality domain, those were deteriorating,"" she added. ""The trust indicator within urban areas in the country, they were deteriorating.""

95th out of 156 countries in the That's right. Bhutan is not the happiest country in the world. It actually ranks95th out of 156 countriesin the 2019 World Happiness Report. Much of that has to do with the nation's poverty, and the challenges of bringing economic and social equity to a predominately agricultural society.

Much of the rural population relies on subsistence farming in a high-mountain environment that is vulnerable to climate change. Rugged terrain, frequent floods and landslides hinder development; urban-rural connectivity is poor. Television was only introduced in 1999 and there are still no traffic lights in the capital city.

""There's another misunderstanding ... that Bhutan has claimed that we're the happiest country,"" said Tshoki. ""I don't think we're the happiest country.

""But what sets Bhutan apart from the other countries is that our vision is clear,"" she added. ""Our vision is to reach a state where societies have all the enabling conditions intact, not only the economic aspects but the other aspects as well, such as the environment, the community, having access to health and education and so on.""

Dr. Prime Minister

One only needs to follow 50-year-old Lotay to see the Bhutanese way in action. He exercises daily, but one day is special. Every Thursday he steadily pedals up a steep hill outside Thimphu, Bhutan's capital city. His goal is the 169-foot-tall Buddha Dordenma statue, one of the largest in the world. His mission is two-fold: exercise to strengthen his body, and prayer and meditation to strengthen his mind.

Prime Minister Dr. Lotay Tshering prays outside of Buddha Dordenma.

""When we say stronger, it just does not mean the muscle strength,"" Lotay says. ""It means the mental strength, the strength of your neurons. So those are the ingredients to help your neurons to be very strong.""

After his bike ride, the Prime Minister makes his way to the hospital for rounds. As a urologist and surgeon for more than 20 years, being a doctor is an integral part of what makes him happy. Therefore, he makes time on Thursdays and Saturdays to pursue his passion, which just happens to reflect his values.

""Since I come from a traditional family, I always thought we should help others,"" Lotay says. ""I thought being religious is the way forward, so on that note I really wanted to be a monk. My mother said why not be a doctor so that you can be really of help to the needy ones and so ... I decided to be a doctor.""

As he makes his hospital rounds with residents and interns, Lotay tries to instill the same values he has practiced, values he says he tries to bring to how he approaches two of Bhutan's top goals: universal healthcare and education.

""Health and education are the most powerful social levelers,"" the Prime Minister says. ""So based on that, we have free health and free education in our country. While it is free, it is not easily accessible, easily available for everyone that needs the service.

Tshering visits with a patient on hospital rounds.

""I thought we could improve the accessibility of health care services to especially the needy ones, those who are based in the villages,"" he said, adding that ""this pair of hands can only do so much. A surgical blade can only operate a patient at a time.

""I joined politics to see mainly if I can bring in some policy changes,"" he added, ""so that with the stroke of my surgical blade, I treat one patient. With the stroke of a pen I can treat the whole nation.""

Bhutan's future

The country may not rank highest in happiness, yet, but it has made major gains. Thousand of kilometers of roads have been constructed and phone lines installed. Run-of-the-river hydroelectricity accounts for the largest share of its economy.

Water flows through tunnels at the site of the Punatsangchhu hydro-electric power project in Wangdue, Bhutan.

The World Bank calls Bhutan a developmental success story, with decreasing levels of extreme poverty and improvements in gender equality, as well as a stable political and economic environment.

""Just over the last three to four decades our life expectancy at birth has increased from near 50 to over 70,"" said Lotay. ""With modernization, with decent access to good health care, more nutritious food and health awareness being better day by day, so many Bhutanese now live longer.""

Bhutan places a tight control on tourism, including visits to the Tiger's Nest, a sacred Buddhist site on a cliffside.

Due to the country's natural beauty and native culture, ecotourism is huge. To manage it within the country's Gross National Happiness mandate, Bhutan imposes an ecotourism tax of $250 a day per person, which they use to offset the environmental impact of thousands of visitors. It's been so successful that Bhutan says it's not only carbon-neutral, it's carbon-negative.

The country has long partnered with the World Wildlife Fund to protect native wildlife in numerous parks. Plastic bags have been banned since 1999. Tobacco has been banned since 2005, making Bhutan the world's first smoke-free nation. The Bhutanese constitution mandates that at least 60% of the country remain under forest cover. Right now, said Lotay, they are at 70%.

Despite the need for economic growth, the Prime Minister is confident those priorities will not change for the Bhutanese people.

""When we know that monetary wealth and material wealth will not translate to what you actually want in your life ... peace of mind and happiness ... then why should we target that as our main objective?

""We have to think about the next generations to come,"" he added. ""So, these are the values of Gross National Happiness that we practice. That's why economically we may not be doing very well because all those checks and balances will ensure that whatever we initiate will be sustainable, will be for generations to come.""",2019-09-13,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/09/13/health/bhutan-gross-national-happiness-wellness/index.html
Allie Torgan,"From rock superstar to all-star dishwasher, Jon Bon Jovi is keeping his community fed","(CNN) When rock band Bon Jovi canceled its summer tour due to the global pandemic, front man Jon Bon Jovi didn't waste a beat turning his focus to those in need in his own backyard.

At his JBJ Soul Kitchen , a non-profit community restaurant in New Jersey, diners pay a cash donation that covers their meal and a meal for someone in need.

But amid earlier Covid-19 restrictions, the restaurant -- run by the Jon Bon Jovi Soul Foundation -- could only remain open for takeout.

Without its regular in-house volunteer base, the kitchen kept operations afloat with the help of the rock star dishwasher.

""There's an in-need population here in New Jersey who depend on us,"" Bon Jovi told CNN in April. ""Hence, the All-Star Hall of Fame dishwasher is back in business.""

Bon Jovi helped out five days a week until just recently, when the restaurant entered phase two and began seating customers per new guidelines.

Over its 13-week takeout period, the restaurant provided more than 7,800 to-go meals to individuals, families, community partners and frontline workers.

At one point, Bon Jovi's wife, Dorothea, took a picture of him washing dishes for social media. It was captioned, ""Do what you can.""

The caption inspired him to pen a song and ask fans around the world to do their part as well.

""The songwriter in me came out, and I wrote the song 'If You Can't Do What You Do, You Do What You Can,'"" he said. ""I knew that people from all walks of life would have their stories to tell, so I invited them to write me a verse.""

From lyrics about missed graduations, fears, togetherness and health, Bon Jovi has been able to hear from and share experiences of fans and musicians around the world.

""It's a great opportunity for me to stay in touch with people around the world and just let them know that I'm thinking of them,"" he said. ""It's a reminder that, even if you can't do what you do, you do what you can.""

Now, as New Jersey enters stage two of its reopening plan, JBJ Soul Kitchen has transitioned back to its pay-it-forward model, continuing to serve delicious meals with dignity.

""Our desire is to make sure that anyone who needs a meal knows that they can come and see us,"" Bon Jovi said, ""and we'll provide them with that nutritious meal.""",2020-07-09,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/09/us/bon-jovi-new-jersey-meals-pandemic-cnnheroes/index.html
Helen Regan,July 13 coronavirus news,"Public health orders in Wyoming will be extended through July 31 due to the increasing number of Covid-19 case, Gov. Mark Gordon announced in a statement today.

The state announced 39 new lab-confirmed cases and three new probable cases today. The state has reported a total of 1,545 lab-confirmed positive cases of Covid-19, 359 probable cases and 21 deaths.

For the past two weeks, Wyoming has had an average of 27 lab-confirmed cases of Covid-19 with 342 new cases that have been confirmed since July 1.

“I’m disappointed again that we continue to see case numbers rise,” Gordon said. “Wyoming residents only need to look at what Texas, Florida and Arizona are experiencing to see how much damage being careless, not wearing a mask, and failing to social distance can cause to our state’s economy, our citizens' health and our healthcare system. I am encouraged to see many of our businesses taking this responsibility seriously and both requiring staff and urging customers to wear face coverings.”

Hazel Pfeifer,Ocean investment could aid post-Covid-19 economic recovery,"(CNN) Every dollar invested in a sustainable ocean economy can yield at least five times the return in benefits, according to a new report commissioned by the High Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy.

As many countries roll out bailout packages to counter the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, the report says investment in these four key ocean intervention areas could help aid economic recovery both now and in the future:

-- Conservation and restoration of mangroves

-- Decarbonization of the shipping industry

-- Scaling up offshore wind production

-- Increasing sustainable protein from the ocean

""They give jobs and livelihoods to people and communities and you're doing so by investing in making your environment more sustainable,"" said Manaswita Konar, lead author of the report. The study found that these four areas all give between five and 10 times the return on investment in terms of economic, environmental and health benefits, and could provide minimum net returns of $8.2 trillion over 30 years.

The report builds on research last year from the High-Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy showing how ocean-based climate action can provide a fifth of the carbon emissions cuts needed to achieve the Paris Climate Accord goal of only 1.5 degrees of global warming.

New research shows that global temperatures could exceed that 1.5 degrees target in the next five years.

The High-Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy is a coalition of 14 world leaders focused on developing a sustainable ocean economy. The group includes Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and leaders from Norway, Jamaica, Indonesia, Mexico and Kenya.

With the world's population due to reach almost 10 billion by 2050 , sustainable low-carbon sources of protein from the ocean, like fish and shellfish, can help reduce the pressure on emissions-intensive, land-based farming of livestock such as beef and lamb.

The new report details how these benefits or ""ocean services"" are increasingly under threat due to pollution, rising human population, overfishing and climate change. Some of these factors have already led to devastating acidification of coral reefs and loss of biodiversity in recent years, with over a third of corals and marine mammals threatened with extinction

""Often the ocean is portrayed ... as a victim of climate change and now also as a victim of the economic crisis post-Covid, but rarely do we think about ocean-based investments and solutions in terms of addressing these challenges,"" said Konar.

In light of the economic challenges facing many governments worldwide, there has been a concerted push from environmental groups to pressure policymakers to stick to their commitments on carbon emissions and help stimulate a greener economy, amid concerns that climate action could take a backseat to short-term economic recovery.

The International Energy Agency has released a report produced with the International Monetary Fund calling for a $3 trillion investment in green recovery with the potential to create around 9 million jobs a year.

""The challenge for ocean protection is there's a tendency to use the pandemic not to do the management that we already agreed to do,"" according to Jackie Savitz, chief policy officer for America ocean conservation nonprofit Oceana.

Savitz said she has seen moves to weaken fisheries management in the US rather than make them more sustainable. ""We have to be careful we don't undo all the good work we've done to date.""

The good news is she says that in many ways, ocean protection needn't be a huge financial investment for cash-strapped governments.

For example, strategies like setting science-based limits on fishing so that stocks can recover, practicing selective fishing to protect endangered species and ensuring that fishing gear doesn't destroy ocean habitats are all effective, cost-efficient ways to manage sustainable fisheries.

""For a lot of it, it's just good management,"" said Savitz. ""The real high cost comes in political will and making the right decisions that benefit citizens in the future. And unfortunately, that seems to be the hardest thing to do.""",2020-07-13,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/13/world/ocean-investment-world-resources-institute-cte/index.html
Tamara Qiblawi,"Dumpster diving, blackouts and suicides. Lebanon's woes laid bare as crisis deepens","Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) A young man with a swagger approaches a dumpster. An employee from a nearby restaurant has just dumped a trash bag inside. He scoops the bag up, rummaging through it to look for leftover hummus and beans. Finding a half-smoked cigarette, he lights it, and puts it to his lips. Then, wiping his hands on his black shirt, he pokes his head into the container one last time, to check there's nothing else he can use, before walking away.

Two blocks away, on Beirut's bustling Hamra Street, a baby stroller lies atop a pile of garbage bags. ""What do you think? Could we use this?"" A veiled, middle-aged woman asks her young daughter. The woman holds up the contraption, examining its contorted pink rods.

Across the country, elderly couples sift through refuse together, and young men scrounge for clothes and shoes to bring back to their families.

Many of them cower when approached by cameras and journalists. ""Please, just go to the other side of the street. Go far away,"" one man, searching through a Beirut dumpster, told a CNN crew.

For many of those scavenging for goods in Lebanon , poverty is a new, and bitter, experience.

A man dismantles and sorts through discarded electric devices at a scrap workshop in the Bab al-Tabbaneh neighborhood of Lebanon's northern city of Tripoli on June 3, 2020.

As Lebanon entered a Covid-induced lockdown earlier this year, the destruction of the middle class remained largely out of sight, but now, as it reopens, there's no escaping the dystopian scenes of desperation repeated across the country.

Nearly every day, the snowball effect of Lebanon's economic meltdown brings new developments. For weeks, the country's currency has been in free-fall, losing 60% of its value in the last month alone.

People's life savings, locked up by the banks' discretionary capital controls, imposed since November, are largely believed to have gone up in smoke.

Doctors and university professors who, just a few months ago, were considered upper-middle class are now making the equivalent of a few hundred dollars a month.

Meanwhile, prices have surged -- the situation is verging on hyper-inflation -- and fuel shortages have plunged the country into darkness, with power outages lasting almost 24 hours.

The capital city of Beirut remains in darkness during a power outage on Monday, July 6, 2020.

""It feels very hopeless,"" said Carmen Geha, an activist and associate professor of public administration at the American University of Beirut. ""You're sitting and waiting and every day it gets worse, and the people around you get worse.

""It feels like you're waiting for the end of the world, with people eating out of garbage cans and people stealing from pharmacies,"" she added, recalling one recent armed robbery of diapers at a pharmacy. Diapers are prohibitively expensive for many in Lebanon.

""I didn't think it was going to be this bad,"" she said. ""I didn't think we would be living in a jungle.""

Less than nine months ago, the country swelled with acts of indignation against a political elite widely accused of corruption. Protesters demanding the downfall of Lebanon's sectarian leadership forced nationwide road closures, and patriotic anthems blasted from speakers set up at makeshift protest sites likened to social utopias.

Fast forward to today, and the contrast is stark.

The flurry of small demonstrations that continue to crop up around the country receives scant media attention. Instead, a string of recent suicides dominates conversations, and the atmosphere is solemn.

Half-empty cafes and restaurants play music at low volume, and social media pages that would normally be advertising summer parties and carnivals now issue a rapid succession of calls for solidarity and humanitarian relief.

Last Friday, a man shot and killed himself near a Dunkin Donuts branch in the middle of a busy street. He had prepared a sign, reading: ""I am not a heretic,"" in reference to a well-known Lebanese leftist song, and an apparent reference to religious taboos around suicide. The verse continues: ""But hunger is heresy.""

Even attempts to lighten the mood appear only to have succeeded in deepening people's sorrow.

On Sunday, an orchestra inside the ancient city of Baalbeck's Temple of Jupiter -- a venue that once hosted concerts by the likes of Nina Simone and the Egyptian diva Um Kulthoum -- played to an empty hall. The concert, entitled ""The Sound of Resilience,"" was broadcast across the country.

Musicians from the Lebanese Philharmonic Orchestra perform during a concert in the ancient northeastern city of Baalbek, Lebanon, Sunday, July 5, 2020.

But as a light show beamed out from the concert hall to the soaring notes of Carmina Burana, a drone camera rose above the majestic temple, showing the vibrant colors glowing amid the pitch-black darkness of yet another power outage. Many saw this as funeral dirge for a bygone era.

But activists insist that there will be an end to this bleak picture.

Around the country, there is growing anger at a ruling elite that has done little to stymie the country's economic meltdown.

Leading figures in the political class point fingers at each other, jockeying for power. Reforms promised by the government of Prime Minister Hassan Diab, a self-style technocrat, have largely fallen by the wayside.

Negotiations with the International Monetary Fund have stalled after politicians aligned with the country's banking elite torpedoed the government's IMF-endorsed economic program, which had been expected to dig into bank profits.

Lebanese Prime Minister Hassan Diab and Iraq's Oil Minister Ihsan Abdel-Jabbara hold a meeting in Beirut on July 3, 2020.

The international community -- once an active player in Lebanese domestic politics -- has also been largely idle.

US officials have repeatedly signaled that aid would be conditional on Iran-backed Hezbollah's exit from government, where they have had seats since 2005.

International transfers have slowed because more foreign banks are shying away from a Lebanese banking sector riddled with accusations of mismanagement.

Many also suspect that Lebanese banks could be affected by the newly imposed Caesar Act, which sanctions assets from neighboring Syria.

Amine Issa, political coordinator for non-sectarian party The National Bloc, argues that the solution lies in nothing short of political transformation.

He calls the economic meltdown a ""panic-driven collapse,"" prompted by tumbling trust in the political leadership. ""The whole issue is one of trust ... not of supply and demand,"" said Issa.

A protester holding the Lebanese flag runs as protesters block the Jounieh Tripoli highway with flaming tires in Jal el Dib, northeast of Beirut on June 11.

He believes a boost in political confidence could lead to an economic turnaround: ""If (the leadership) stays then the country goes towards destruction,"" he said, calling up images of an educated middle class preparing to abandon the country, in favor of more promising shores.

""What happened on October 17 was a huge step,"" he said, referring to the popular uprising that began last year. ""There is a new breath, a new conviction, a new awareness that we want to build on.""

Some argue that the relative silence of the protest movement is because activists are busy organizing, coalescing into a political alternative to the current sectarian leadership.

The solutions, activists say, aren't something from a political utopia but lie within the existing legal system, which favors a non-sectarian state.

""We are very different from other Arab regimes because the solution is in our constitution,"" said AUB's Geha. ""We need to activate this system, that's all. It says that there should be a transition into a non-sectarian state.

""This is not like saying we want to bring a regime down because we want freedom. Actually, we're hostages of not having a system,"" she said. ""It is the pursuit of the rule of law.""

Meanwhile, acts of social solidarity are as commonplace as signs of despair.

Eight-year-old Lina leads her cousin, six-year-old Iman, into a bookstore to ask for money. The staff offers them hand sanitizer and, following company policy, an employee leads them outside -- only to furtively sneak cash into their pockets.

(CNN) In the latest sign that the coronavirus pandemic is far from under control, Sunday ushered in a global record for new infections , with more than 230,000 cases reported in a 24-hour period by the World Health Organization.

The biggest portion of those new infections were in the United States, where a staggering 1 in 100 people has now tested positive and individual states are in worse shape than some countries. If Florida was a nation, it would rank fourth globally for most new cases in a day.

As second and third waves begin to emerge in countries that have eased up restrictions, and the WHO confirms evidence of airborne transmission, the political and cultural war on face coverings is still raging.

The three countries at the top of the pandemic chart -- the United States, Brazil and the UK -- are those in which people still resist wearing masks. Mask wearing has, up until last week, largely been shunned and even ridiculed by the leaders of the worst-hit countries -- the US and Brazil.

In the UK, Prime Minister Boris Johnson -- who spent time in intensive care in April with the virus -- had not, until Friday, worn a mask in public either. His lack of guidance and effective messaging on masks has meant Britons are reluctant to wear them.

But the science is clear. Taiwan, South Korea and mainland China, all places with widespread mask use, have seen greater success in preventing major outbreaks or reining them in once they begin. And new research shows that masks can help cut down on one of the main drivers of cases: ""silent spreaders,"" or people who are asymptomatic or presymptomatic.

YOU ASKED. WE ANSWERED

Q: If you take the Covid-19 test on Friday, will those results still be accurate on Monday?

A: It depends on the type of test you take, CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta says. There are two:

A viral test -- which can be taken by a swab of your throat or nose, as well as via a saliva sample -- will tell you whether you are currently infected with Covid-19. So, if you took the test on a Friday and the results came back negative, it means that you were Covid-19 free on Friday. But anything can happen after that. According to the CDC, someone infected with Covid-19 could test negative initially one day and then test positive later as the infection develops. An antibody test uses a blood sample. It may take a few weeks for your body to produce antibodies after a Covid-19 infection. So if you test positive, it means that you had Covid-19 in the past and you probably have some immunity to it. But we still don't know how long those antibodies -- or immunity -- last.

Neither of the tests are 100% accurate. There could be false positives and false negatives. No matter the result, we have to be careful in protecting ourselves and others from getting the virus by wearing a mask, and by physical distancing.

WHAT'S IMPORTANT TODAY

Florida's virus record exemplifies disaster of early openings

Florida's staggering new single-day US state record of cases underscores how the aggressive opening strategy championed by Trump and allied governors is turning into one of the worst political and economic calls in modern history, Stephen Collinson writes

The Sunshine State recorded more than 15,000 new infections on Sunday -- the highest number of new cases in a single day by any state -- and has run out of ICU beds in 40 hospitals, as the pandemic rages across southern and western heartlands including Texas, Georgia and Arizona. The surge came two months after many states, disregarding government guidelines, opened up bars, gyms, hair salons and other businesses.

Florida Rep. Donna Shalala, a freshman Democrat and former secretary of Health and Human Services under President Bill Clinton, said the virus was out of control partly because the governor, a Trump ally, would not tell everyone to wear masks and telling CNN: ""this is an American tragedy"".

White House takes aim at Fauci

The White House is taking aim at the nation's top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci . In a statement Saturday, a White House official told CNN that ""several White House officials are concerned about the number of times Dr. Fauci has been wrong on things."" The official went on to provide a lengthy list of examples, citing Fauci's comments early in the pandemic and linking to past interviews.

The move to treat Fauci -- who has been a trusted voice on the crisis in America -- as a political opponent by the White House comes as Trump and the epidemiologist are not on speaking terms. The tension between the two men has grown publicly as the two have responded to one another through interviews and statements.

Bollywood reels as top stars test positive

The coronavirus has hit one of Bollywood's leading families , as India struggles to contain a widening outbreak. The country now has the third-highest total cases -- after the US and Brazil -- and continues to tally new record numbers of cases daily.

Superstar Amitabh Bachchan -- whose face is plastered across the country -- his son Abhishek Bachchan and daughter-in-law, actress Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, have all been admitted to hospital following positive tests.

There are hopes that their hospitalization will encourage Indians to get tested. India has so far carried out fewer coronavirus tests per capita than many other countries.

The pandemic pressed pause on overtourism. Now Asia is rethinking the industry

Before the pandemic put a stop to most international travel, each year millions of people flocked to Southeast Asia's white sandy beaches, ancient temples and diverse wildlife. In some places the crowds became so intense it caused locals, environmentalists and even governments to complain that overtourism was pushing the region's fragile ecosystems to breaking point.

Then Covid-19 struck. And the tourists were largely gone. As travel restrictions lift, countries that rely heavily on tourism will be competing for visitors as they seek to rebuild their economies. The temptation to attract as many tourists as possible could be difficult to resist, Helen Regan and Kocha Olarn write

But experts say the global pause on tourism has offered countries an unprecedented opportunity to examine how to rebuild their tourism industries in a way that benefits their economies and also protects the planet.

TOP TIPS

How do you explain to children that the challenges of pandemic life -- from missed social events to physical distancing -- aren't likely to end soon? It's a question many parents are grappling with, as Covid-19 shows no signs of abating.

But while the virus is unlike anything the world has faced in living memory, previous generations of children and youth have lived, grown and even thrived through great hardship. Their stories can be models of resilience, said children's book author and librarian Glenda Armand.

Armand, whose book ""Love Twelve Miles Long"" recounts the story of a young abolitionist Frederick Douglass, noted that there are important lessons for today's children in even the grimmest periods of history. Find her other book recommendations here

Administrators for the carrier announced Friday that it had selected Bain Capital, the US private equity firm, to take over the company, two months after its collapse . Terms of the deal were not disclosed.

Bain won out over Cyrus Capital Partners, a New York-based investment firm, which had also submitted a binding offer.

""Several proposals from other interested parties"" were also submitted this week, including a proposal by some of the airline's bondholders, according to the administrators.

Bain Capital says it wants to ""protect as many jobs as possible"" at Virgin Australia while supporting the airline's ""unique culture."" The airline employs about 10,000 people.",2020-06-25,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/25/business/virgin-australia-sale-bain-capital-intl-hnk/index.html

The cuts announced Thursday account for 20% of Qantas' total workforce of 29,000 people, according to the company. They will primarily affect the airline's corporate, ground and flight staff, while another 15,000 workers will remain on furlough ""until flying returns,"" it added. Jetstar, the company's budget carrier, will also be affected.

Boeing BA The airline is also making drastic changes to its fleet as part of a broader, three-year plan to help its business recover from the historic slump in global travel . Most of the carrier's international aircraft — or up to 100 planes — will stay grounded for a year, the company said. Its six747 jumbo jets are also being retired six months ahead of schedule.

The new measures are expected to help the company lower costs by 15 billion Australian dollars ($10 billion) over three years. After that, it's targeting 1 billion Australian dollars (roughly $686,000) in recurring savings each year.

Qantas shares, which have fallen 41% this year, were halted from trading in Sydney on Thursday as it made the announcement.

Hilary Whiteman,"In this Australian hotel, refugee and asylum seeker guests are not allowed to leave","Brisbane, Australia (CNN) Every day, the men unfurl large pleas for help over the balcony railings of their hotel room and stand in silence as traffic roars along the main road of the Australian city they're trapped in.

Their signs are mostly made from bin bags stuck together with tape, and secured to the railing with shoelaces.

""Where is justice?"" one reads.

These men are not hotel guests, but refugees and asylum seekers who have been in Australian immigration custody for seven years. Many arrived in Australian waters in 2013, after the government introduced offshore immigration processing. They were detained on the remote islands of Manus in Papua New Guinea (PNG) and on Nauru in the Pacific, in conditions once described by the United Nations as "" harsh"" and ""inadequate ."" In 2016, Amnesty International called Nauru an ""open-air prison.""

All are suffering the effects of prolonged, indefinite detention and were brought to Australia last year for urgent medical treatment.

But some say the conditions in the Brisbane hotel are worse than PNG or Nauru.

""You're in prison in here. In PNG, you have a little bit of freedom. You can move around. There is no ABF (Australian Border Force), no security guards around you,"" said Farhad Rahmati, an Iranian refugee who was transferred to Australia from PNG last July.

For months, the 120 or so men inside the hotel kept quiet about their plight. However that changed in March, when the number of coronavirus cases in Brisbane started rising. Fearing the virus would enter the hotel via the guards who come and go, they crafted signs large enough to be seen from the street.

As people noticed their pleas, weekly demonstrations began outside the hotel. These demonstrations have now escalated into a blockade by human rights activists who are demanding the men be freed.

The standoff between cellphone-armed protesters and security guards has cast unwanted attention on an Australian immigration policy that has long been, by definition, focused offshore.

Now it's playing out in the heart of one of Australia's largest cities in a 4.5-star hotel that only a few months ago was still accepting paying guests.

Protesters staged weekly protests that escalated into an occupation when security guards tried to remove a detainee.

Offshore detention

In 2018, it was reported that Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison had a model migrant boat on his desk bearing the words: ""I stopped these.""

Before taking high office, Morrison helped strengthen the country's border protection policies, which mandate that people arriving by boat will be processed offshore -- and even if they are found to be refugees, they will never be settled in Australia.

The government says this policy removes demand for people smugglers and prevents deaths at sea. Boat arrivals peaked in 2012, when more than 17,000 passengers arrived from Iran, Afghanistan, Myanmar and other troubled nations, via hubs such as Indonesia and Malaysia.

Few boats arrive now, but human rights advocates say the policy has created a cohort of prisoners confined to islands offshore. As the detainees' mental health deteriorated, advocates pushed for a law to allow doctors to decide if they should be brought to Australia for medical treatment. The medevac bill was passed in March 2019, opening the door for transfers, but the government abruptly closed it again after winning an election that May, citing national security concerns.

Before that happened, almost 200 men had been brought to Australia under the medevac law, including some who were suicidal. Others had brain injuries, undiagnosed gastrointestinal bleeding, heart conditions and broken bones that needed surgery.

For months, many of those detainees lived in one of the Brisbane hotel's three buildings, confined to the upper floors -- and beyond the view of paying guests. Before the coronavirus outbreak, they were allowed visits from pre-approved guests. Now, they're only allowed out for medical appointments, escorted by guards.

In March, due to the pandemic, more space was needed for social distancing in Brisbane Immigration Transit Accommodation (BITA), the main immigration detention center on the city's outskirts. About 40 more detainees were moved to the hotel -- and their rooms opened onto a balcony with a view of the street.

Saif Ali Saif peers out from his hotel room balcony where he has hung images of his three-year-old son.

Watching the world go by

Somali father-of-one Saif Ali Saif stands on his balcony each day, with his own sign scribbled in pen on an old T-shirt. It says: ""I want (to) hug my son."" His wife Sabah Siyad lives in community detention 29 kilometers (18 miles away) with their three-year-old son, Sammi. She gets a small government allowance each week and is not allowed to work or study. The family hasn't held each other since March, when visits stopped due to the coronavirus.

Saif worries Sammi will forget him.

Saif Ali Saif was able to receive visits from Sabah Siyad and their son Sammi before the coronavirus pandemic.

Saif escaped war while working as a driver in Yemen; Siyad ran from bombing in Somalia. She lifts her sleeve to show shrapnel scars as proof. The refugees met and married in Nauru in 2016 and Sammi was born on Valentine's Day the following year. Their baby was a few months old when it became apparent that his breathing difficulties required specialist care. Officials approved the baby's transfer to Australia with his mother but not Saif. ""I was really scared my son would die there,"" he said, so he let them go.

Saif was told last June he was being transferred to Australia and has now spent a year in detention. He says he doesn't know why he was transferred.

The family has been separated for three years. ""Sammi wants his father,"" Siyad said.

Iranian refugee Farhad Rahmati was transferred to Australia for treatment for a heart condition.

From his balcony, Rahmati, the Iranian refugee, can see a pub, a car wash, restaurants and a McDonald's on the next block.

""I see everything, but I have no chance to touch it,"" he said. ""I see people walking their dogs. I love dogs. I'd love to have a chance to, you know, to walk my dogs. But look at my situation. I'm not even close to that.""

Rahmati worked as a civil engineer before fleeing Iran in 2013. He doesn't want to talk about why he left.

While Rahmati and Saif stand on the balcony with signs, many detainees don't. They stay in their rooms, worried that protesting will affect their chances of ever being freed.

A detainee holds a sign to the window of his Kangaroo Point hotel room: ""Thank you.""

Strange events on the corner

Even before the signs went up, neighbors noticed something strange going on at the hotel on the corner: cars with blackened windows, guards with earpieces, trucks coming and going on a regular basis. No one told them what was going on at the hotel, which has been there for over a decade.

Central Apartment Group (CAG) took over the hotel's operation in 2018 and changed its name to Kangaroo Point Central Hotel and Apartments. It's one of 18 hotels on the company's website, advertised as family-friendly accommodation ""ideal for business and leisure travellers.""

When contacted by CNN, the group's CEO Sid Knell said he would not comment about events at Kangaroo Point. ""You can ask me about self-drive holidays,"" he said.

Nearby residents, however, have railed against the appearance of a prison on their street.

""How could they start a prison and not tell people?"" asked Annette Hogan. The residents CNN spoke to said they didn't have a problem with the refugees, but the walls and guards had changed the tone of the neighborhood. Opinions differed on the local Facebook page: ""Send them back,"" one post said.

Hannah and Anand Parameswaran have a direct view of the hotel grounds for their kitchen window. From there, they can see the small pool where guests used to swim. The detainees aren't allowed to use it.

""I feel a little bit guilty coming and going,"" said Hannah Parameswaran. Anand agrees: ""I feel really guilty because it's our money being used to do this to them.""

Temporary fences have been erected around the hotel, but the neighbors can see into the hotel grounds from their kitchen.

The Refugee Council of Australia estimates it costs the government 346,000 Australian dollars ($236,000) each year to hold someone in detention in Australia. That is on top of the AU$7 billion ($4.8 billion) the government spent on offshore processing from 2012, according to the Australian National Audit Office

Carmelo Nucifora, who runs Spizzico, the Italian restaurant on the hotel premises, says he wasn't consulted about plans for a prison on the site. As more fences went up, blocking off most of the restaurant's parking area, he said he sought a meeting with Australian Border Force officials. ""I went and pleaded to one of the officers. It's embarrassing, but I cried in front of them, pleading for some attention, for mercy,"" he said.

Like other restaurants in the city, he was forced to limit his business to takeaway only during the coronavirus lockdown. Takings plunged from around AU$14,000 a week to AU$2,000.

Now, even as coronavirus restrictions ease to allow more diners, his restaurant is surrounded by protesters.

Protesters camped in tents outside the hotel until police cleared the sidewalk. Then they moved across the street.

The protests

""Seven years too long. Free the refugees,"" chant protesters through a tannoy outside the hotel. Last Thursday, their weekly protest turned into a 24-hour occupation when word spread that Border Force officials had arrived to transfer Rahmati, the Iranian refugee, to BITA.

Cellphone footage shot by another detainee, and seen by CNN, shows Rahmati being led to a van by security guards, where they are ambushed by protesters, who stand on the roof and glue their hands to the van. Rahmati is hurried back inside the hotel and returned to his room.

Protesters don't want any of the men to be transferred deeper into Australia's immigration detention system. They're demanding the men be released into the community by Christmas.

But on Friday morning, the guards came back for Rahmati.

An Emergency Response Team burst into his room, ordered him to lie face down on his bed, cuffed him, flipped him over and took him to a waiting car, Rahmati said via cellphone from the high-security compound in BITA, where he was taken. Rahmati is in Australia receiving treatment for a heart condition.

Matt Sheppard, from rights group Refugee Solidarity Meanjin, says too few protesters were positioned outside a gate to stop the car that took Rahmati away. After that, protesters blockaded the exits and agreed only to clear them if they were able to search vehicles coming and going, to make sure no more refugees would be transferred.

Sheppard says he believes Rahmati was taken from the hotel because he spoke to the media.

""He's just a really charismatic person that provides a lot of support for the men inside as well. So, I think it was a calculated move to remove him from the community and break up that cohesion,"" he said.

In a statement , Australian Border Force Commissioner Michael Outram denied detainees were being ""punished"" or moved for speaking to advocates or the media. ""Detainees are routinely moved for a range of reasons, including health, welfare or to ensure the safety of other detainees, staff and the public,"" he said.

The day after Rahmati's removal, hundreds gathered in the street to call for the occupants' release. Saif, the Somali refugee, spoke from the balcony, his phone call amplified on speakers to the crowd. ""Let me hug my son,"" he said.

One by one, the crowd started chanting, ""Let him hug his son, let him hug his son."" They cleared a path to the hotel entrance so Siyad could push Sammi towards him in his pram. She got as far as the gate before the request was denied.

They don't know when they'll next be able to meet.

A spokeswoman for acting Immigration Minister Alan Tudge told CNN that ""it was made very clear to those who were transferred under the medevac provisions that they would be placed into immigration detention.""

David Manne, the executive director of Refugee Legal, said the law also allows the minister to release them.

""There are powers at the disposal of the government and the minister personally to release these men from detention. It's incumbent upon the federal government to explain why it's not using those legal powers to release these men from prolonged and indefinite detention,"" he said.

As a signatory to the 1951 Refugee Convention, Australia is obliged to provide a safe place of refuge for people fleeing persecution, or to resettle them elsewhere.

ABF Commissioner Outram said in his statement that the men are ""encouraged to finalize their medical treatment so they can continue on their resettlement pathway to the United States, return to Nauru or PNG or return to their home country.""

Manne said that despite many of their illnesses being severe or critical, there was ""significant information to cast doubt upon whether they are receiving or have received the medical treatment required.""

""It is abundantly clear that the prolonged, indefinite detention of these men, who were critically ill and brought to Australia for treatment, is almost certainly compounding the severity of their medical conditions,"" he said.

The immigration minister's spokeswoman said the men had access to medical professionals and specialists, and any claims to the contrary were incorrect.

Former immigration officer Rebecca Lim, from the Brisbane On-Arrival Refugee and Asylum Seeker Response Group, said volunteers were ready and waiting to help support the men in the Australian community -- when, and if, they are freed.

""If the minister is not making the decision to release the men into community detention because it is not in the public interest, then he needs to explain what that means,"" she said. ""Indefinite detention is wrong.""",2020-06-19,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/19/australia/australia-manus-nauru-hotel-brisbane-hnk-intl/index.html

Morrison revealed the existence of the attacks during a press conference on Friday, adding that a ""state-based cyber actor"" is ""targeting Australian organizations across a range of sectors, including all levels of government, industry, political organizations, education, health, essential service providers and operators of other critical infrastructure.""

He did not specify which agencies or businesses are believed to be under attack, nor did he detail the exact nature of the attacks — though he did say that the government's investigation has not uncovered any ""large-scale personal data breaches.""

Morrison also did not say which state Australia believes to be behind the attack. But he told reporters that ""there are not a large number of state-based actors that can engage in this type of activity.""

""It is clear ... that this has been done by a state-based actor with very, very significant capabilities,"" Morrison added.

Oscar Holland,'It looks like a virus': Australia's new trade logo proves controversial,"Written by Oscar Holland, CNN

Australia's national flower, the golden wattle, has long appeared on stamps, emblems and awards, and is considered a symbol of unity in the country.

But its use in a new logo promoting Australia's interests overseas has proven divisive, with some even likening the design to depictions of the coronavirus.

The controversial logo, which its designers say was partly inspired by Aboriginal art and culture, was suggested by the Nation Brand Advisory Council and approved by Australia's trade minister, Simon Birmingham. And while the council's proposal was submitted back in December 2019 -- long before Covid-19 was classified as a global pandemic -- social media users were quick to draw comparisons.

""I can't believe they have changed the Australian made logo to look like this, it looks like a virus,"" wrote Marck Coure, a New South Wales MP, on Twitter.

Queensland MP Duncan Pegg meanwhile tweeted , ""Wouldn't it have been better to get school students involved to design a new one?"" He added: ""I know they would do a better job than this rubbish!""

Both politicians were among a number of social media users to imply the wattle will replace the kangaroo symbol used to signify Australia-made products. But the golden wattle is reportedly intended to supersede the boomerang logo used by Australia Unlimited, which promotes the country's overseas trade and investment.

In an attempt to quell confusion, Australian Made issued a statement clarifying that the green and gold kangaroo will ""continue its pivotal role in Australia's domestic and overseas branding strategy.""

The Nation Brand Advisory Council, which comprises figures from across business, media and the arts, nonetheless questioned the effectiveness of a kangaroo logo in its rebranding proposal, asking whether the animal would ""shift perceptions of our nation, or simply reinforce what people already knew about us.""

Conversely, the report said, the golden wattle symbol ""provides a blank canvas, to tell a new Australian story.""

Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack told Australia's 9News that both symbols would be used to promote the country's interests, saying that the ""wattle is to attract attention at international trade shows."" Birmingham earlier confirmed to the channel that kangaroos, meanwhile, would ""continue to be a key part of Australia's marketing and logos from our Air Force to our tourism campaigns, our national airline and our sporting teams.""

Historic significance

Despite proving unpopular online, the golden wattle logo was intended to symbolize the flower's historic importance to both indigenous and non-indigenous Australians. According to the Nation Brand Advisory Council's proposal, the dotted design was inspired by Aboriginal art and was created in partnership with an indigenous design firm.

Found across the country, the golden wattle was traditionally used by Aboriginal communities, who would produce a toffee-like substance from its gum. Tannin from its bark was also known for having antiseptic properties. Colonial settlers later cultivated the plant for use in the tanning industry and to produce glue and honey, according to Australia's government

""The wattle has a long held significance for those that walk our land,"" read the council's proposal, which also outlines a new color palette and typeface for Australia's so-called Nation Brand. ""In Indigenous tradition the blooming of the wattle denotes that the bush has come alive with growth. Each dot represents individuals and the coming together of diversity. The animals are plentiful and the fish are full and fat.

""The hearty resilience of the wattle has come to represent the enduring spirit of the Australian people,"" it added.

The council's report said that market testing had indicated a positive response to the new branding, with approval rating of over 70% among respondents. ""Appeal for the wattle logo is strong,"" it claims.

Some on social media were more supportive of the idea. MasterChef Australia winner Adam Liaw took to Twitter to defend the thinking behind the design.

""Unpopular opinion, but pre-COVID this would've been great,"" he wrote . ""Gold and the 'Au' mark (also the elemental symbol for gold) establishes Australia as a premium brand, particularly through Asia.""

Jack Guy,The world's tallest hybrid timber tower to be built in Sydney,"Written by Jack Guy, CNN

Sydney could soon be home to the world's tallest hybrid timber building if a new project comes to fruition.

BVN design studio and New York -based SHoP Architects have been commissioned to build a new headquarters for software company Atlassian, which will be constructed using timber, steel and glass, according to a BVN press release.

The building will have approximately 40 floors and will feature natural ventilation and large planted terraces.

The hybrid construction could use 50% less embodied carbon than conventional techniques and, once completed, use 50% less energy than a conventional building.

It will also feature solar panels and operate on 100% renewable energy from the day it opens.

""Atlassian has their eyes set firmly on the future, this project will achieve a number of 'firsts' globally and in Australia,"" Ninotschka Titchkosky, BVN co-CEO, said in a statement.

""It will make what was once best practice seem inadequate and hopefully lift the ambition of the built environment across Australia.""

BVN were chosen as the design team, with SHoP as the architects. Credit: SHoP/BVN Architects

The building will use a technique known as Mass Timber Construction (MTC), involving a steel exoskeleton that supports the rest of the structure.

MTC is ""one of the most hopeful technologies in moving the construction industry toward real solutions to the global climate crisis,"" according to BVN.

The planned structure will incorporate the existing facade of an old parcel shed that currently houses a YHA youth hostel.

The building will stand in the tech precinct at Sydney's Central Station and could be completed by 2025, as part of a planned regeneration of the area that could provide workspace for some 25,000 employees, with 4,000 in the Atlassian building alone.

Offices around the world have closed due to the coronavirus pandemic and some companies have told employees they will be working from home for good. But Altassian is confident its planned building will respond to the new realities of working life.

""The space that we are building will be highly sustainable and highly flexible. It will be purpose-built for the future of work, for tomorrow's world, not today's,"" said Scott Farquhar, Atlassian co-founder and co-CEO, in the statement.

""Even with a highly distributed workforce, we'll need a place to come together. Now we can design this space especially for these new ways of working.""

Both Farquhar and local government leader Gladys Berejiklian, the New South Wales Premier, said the new district would generate jobs and drive the area's recovery from coronavirus.

Development applications will be submitted in the next few months, with construction to begin next year if approved.

The world's current tallest timber building is an 18-story tower in the Norwegian town of Brumunddal. The 280-foot-tall Mjøstårnet tower became the world's tallest timber building when it opened in 2019.

There is a growing body of evidence that timber can provide a sustainable alternative to concrete and steel. A slew of new timber high-rises is set to break ground or open in 2020.

HoHo Vienna, a mixed-use development just five feet shorter than Mjøstårnet, opened for business in Austria early in the year, and Pritzker Prize-winning architect Shigeru Ban has designed a ""hybrid"" condo complex comprising a steel and concrete core with a timber frame that will open this year in Vancouver, Canada.",2020-07-14,https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/sydney-hybrid-timber-tower-scli-intl/index.html

I wish I could tell you I knew exactly when you could go back to having playdates and learning from your teachers in person, but there's just no answer to that yet. That's one of the hardest things about life during this time -- not having answers.

But I've gotten some amazing questions from you, and I'm going to try and answer them the best I can. I've also brought in my friend Carl Azuz -- many of you probably know him as the anchor of CNN10 in classrooms across the country.

Carl Azuz (on CNN10): We know what it's doing, we know where it's spreading, but where did Covid-19 come from? That's the first thing we're looking at today on CNN10 and we're happy to have you along for the hunt.

Gupta: Hey Carl!

Azuz: Sanjay, it's always a pleasure to work with you. Thank you for thinking of me.

Gupta: So, let's jump right in. Our first question comes from Micah in Maryland.

Micah: I wonder where the coronavirus came from. If it was from bats, how did it change or mutate? Thank you, stay well.

Gupta: Thanks, Micah. Scientists do think that this coronavirus did come from bats in China. What we're not entirely sure about is exactly how it got into humans. It could be that the bat made another animal sick and then that animal got a human sick. Or it could be that it spread directly from bats to humans. It is also possible that the bats were studied in a lab and that the virus spread to humans that way. We just don't know yet. Next we have a question from PJ in Florida.

PJ: Will we have to wear masks in public forever? Thank you.

Azuz: I have good news for you, PJ. No, we are not going to have to wear masks in public forever, although some people might think they're pretty fashionable and want to keep it going. That's the good news. The bad news is we don't know when we'll be able to take them off.

Gupta: That's right, Carl. And I think it's also important to remember that when you wear a mask, it's to help protect other people from you. It makes it less likely that you can spread the germs from you to somebody else. Remember, even if you're not sick, even if you're not coughing or sneezing, if you have the virus inside your body, you could possibly spread it to others. A mask helps prevent you from doing that.

Azuz: Alright, Sachin is in New York City with our next question.

Sachin: What do the germs look like? What do the germs feel like when you have them?

Azuz: Sachin, I have no idea what germs look like. I think Dr. Sanjay Gupta might be the best person to answer that one.

Gupta: Sachin, the thing about germs and viruses like this is that they are too small for us to see or feel even on our skin. But that doesn't mean that scientists haven't been able to use microscopes and get a good look at them. This coronavirus is called coronavirus because corona means crown. So this looks like a little blob with a crown on top of it. That crown is actually a bunch of little spikes that the virus uses to move around and to get inside the body. That's the reason you have to wash your hands a lot, because when you use soap and water, you can actually clean those germs off your hands even if you can't see it happening. Even though you can't see these germs or these viruses, they are all over the place. They're on door handles, sometimes they're on your toys. But the good news is that many of these germs aren't going to make you that sick. Now we have a question from Abby, in Washington, DC.

Abby: My question about coronavirus is: Will I be able to go to camp and different places in the summer?

Gupta: Abby, this is probably the number one question that I get even in my own home. What are things going to be like this summer? Well, Abby, there's a good chance that we may still have to be home this summer. We still don't know yet. We got to make sure that in different places around the country, things are headed in the right direction, that there are fewer people getting sick, that more people can get tested. When we get to that point, we may start to slowly open things back up. The one thing, Abby, we don't want to happen is that more people get sick that didn't need to because they went out too early. Now we have a question from Leonard in California.

Leonard: Are there any drugs that can actually help you not get this virus?

Azuz: Well I don't know if I would call it a drug, Leonard, but I can say that washing your hands is a really good way to keep yourself safe from this virus.

Dr. Gupta: Yep, right now, the only medications for this coronavirus are ones that help treat your symptoms. So if you have a cough, runny nose or a fever, there are certain medicines that can help with that. But there are scientists all around the world in labs who are working at different treatments to treat the virus itself. And hopefully by the summer, we may have some good answers on that.

Azuz: You know Sanjay, you are a doctor, you're going to have some pretty good points. And that was another one. You want to make sure that you are doing other things you can do just to keep yourself healthy, besides washing your hands, to eat a healthy diet. Fruits and vegetables. Make sure you get lots of sleep. Make sure you get some exercise as long as you're, you know, not getting too close to other people. And it's a good idea to do that, whether or not there's a threat from coronavirus. Santiago in California is next.

Santiago: Will more families become poorer after this passes? I'm worried that my family or other families will become hungry or homeless.

Azuz: Santiago, that's a very important question. I'm sorry that you're worried about it. As far as families becoming poorer, we do know that a lot of people have lost their jobs. There are a lot of folks who are unable to work right now because businesses are closed down. But there are also a lot of folks helping others. For one thing, the US government has spent trillions of dollars trying to get money to people in need. Also, we've heard from a number of different charity organizations.

We know some churches are involved in helping their communities. And then there are some folks who are just giving lunches to students who might normally get those at school but can't because of the coronavirus. So the good thing here, Santiago, is the fact that so many people are helping others in different communities. And that's something that gives us all hope. And last question is from North Carolina. Sydney, what's on your mind?

Sydney: When will the coronavirus be over? When will the scientists get a cure for the coronavirus and how will they find it?

Azuz: Thanks for the question, Sydney. If it were up to me, it would be over in five minutes. Everybody would be healthy. You'd be able to go back to school, hang out with your friends, go to concerts, all the fun stuff that you and your parents love to do.

Gupta: That's right, Carl. Sydney, everybody wants the answer to this question. One thing we need to make sure we can do is start to test people for the virus. Letting them know whether they have it in their bodies and making sure that if they do, they don't spread it to other people. Right now, Sydney, one of the most promising things out there is that scientists are working on finding a vaccine. That's a medicine that can help teach your body how to fight the virus. We probably won't have a vaccine until next year some time. But once that happens, that will protect us against this virus, just like a flu shot protects you against the flu.

Gupta: These have all been really great questions. Thank you so much for sending them in. And Carl, thank you very much. I really appreciate it. You have such a great way of talking to kids. I know they adore you.

Azuz: Hey, thank you, Sanjay. Always a pleasure working with you. Happy to be here.

Gupta: Before I sign off, I want to talk directly to parents.

Sometimes it's really hard to figure out how to explain what's going on right now to kids. I know, because I've had to talk to my own kids about it.

Even if your kids are young, or aren't asking about it, experts say it's a good idea to start a conversation with them to see if they have questions or worries that they haven't yet expressed.

Sherisse Pham,China will sanction Lockheed Martin over arms sales to Taiwan,"Hong Kong (CNN Business) China said on Tuesday it would place sanctions on Lockheed Martin (LMT) for its involvement in arms sales to Taiwan, a move that could further escalate tensions between Beijing and Washington.

""China firmly opposes US arms sales to Taiwan,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said at a press conference. Taiwan is a self-ruled island, but China has long vowed to unify it with the mainland.

The United States is one of Taiwan's main arms suppliers. The US State Department last week approved a request by Taiwan to upgrade its Patriot Surface-to-Air missiles at an estimated cost of $620 million, according to Taiwan's state-run Central News Agency.

In response, China is imposing ""sanctions on the main contractor of this arms sale, Lockheed Martin,"" Zhao said, without going into detail. The United States should ""stop selling arms to Taiwan and cut its military ties to Taiwan, so it won't do further harm to bilateral relations between China and the United States,"" he added.

Relations between the world's top two economies were already approaching new lows.",2020-07-14,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/14/business/china-sanctions-lockheed-martin-hnk-intl/index.html
Clare Duffy,Facebook's future keeps getting murkier,"New York (CNN Business) For nearly two months, Facebook has been scrambling to get a handle on a wave of criticism over its policies on moderating content, particularly hateful speech and misinformation that spreads on its platforms.

The movement prompted some policy changes andsays it is working to prevent hate, and voter and census suppression. But activists are not yet satisfied and say they will continue pushing for actions, such as demanding that Facebook ban political ads that include lies.

It's not the first time Facebook's content moderation policies have been under the microscope, but this time feels different. Voices inside the company have publicly expressed dismay over its actions, and hundreds of corporations are using the power of their ad dollars to lobby for change from the outside.

The pressure could challenge CEO Mark Zuckerberg's long held desire to preserve free expression on the platform, especially by public figures. But Facebook's size and power — and Zuckerberg's outsized influence within the company — mean it's not yet clear to what extent things might change.

A timeline of the latest content moderation saga

June 1: Facebook employees Facebook employees staged a virtual walkout over the company's inaction on a series of controversial posts from President Donald Trump, including one that said, ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts,"" a phrase with racist origins that critics worried could incite violence. Twitter put a warning label on the same post for violating its rules against ""glorifying violence.""

June 2: Zuckerberg Zuckerberg held a town hall with employees to explain his decision not to take action on Trump's incendiary remarks. But not everyone felt good about the conversation. Brandon Dail, a Facebook engineer, tweeted: ""It's crystal clear today that leadership refuses to stand with us.""

June 17: Facebook said it will Facebook said it will allow users to block political ads

June 17: A coalition of nonprofits launched the #StopHateforProfit campaign, calling on major corporations to pause advertising on Facebook in July, citing the company's ""repeated failure to meaningfully address the vast proliferation of hate on its platforms.""

June 19: Outdoor apparel company The North Face Outdoor apparel company The North Face became the first major brand to join the ad boycott. Soon, REI and Upwork joined, too.

une 23: More More well-known brands joined the boycott , including Patagonia and Ben & Jerry's, ratcheting up pressure on Facebook and other advertisers.

June 24: , a Facebook executive acknowledged that the social media giant faces ""a trust deficit."" On a call with advertisers , a Facebook executive acknowledged that the social media giant faces ""a trust deficit.""

June 26: By this point, the Unilever UL Coca Cola CCHGY By this point, the list of advertisers boycotting Facebook had grown to include major firms such asand. Also during this week, Facebook wrote in an email to advertisers: ""We do not make policy changes tied to revenue pressure.""

June 26: Zuckerberg announced that Facebook will ban ads that scapegoat minorities, immigrants, racial or other groups as part of a wider crackdown on hate speech. Facebook will also apply warning labels to user posts that are newsworthy but violate the platform's policies. Rashad Robinson, president of the civil rights group Color of Change, called the remarks ""11 minutes of wasted opportunity"" and doubled down on calls for advertisers to boycott Facebook.

June 28: Facebook executive Nick Clegg Facebook executive Nick Clegg pushed back on the premise of the boycott , saying the company has ""no incentive to tolerate hate speech.""

June 29: Facebook stock fell 3% early in the day before rebounding, a sign that Facebook stock fell 3% early in the day before rebounding, a sign that the boycott had begun to rattle investors

July 7: Zuckerberg and other Zuckerberg and other Facebook executives met with civil rights and activist groups to discuss the demands of the boycott. After the meeting, the groups slammed Facebook for what they said was a failure to firmly commit to or outline a timeline for making the changes they'd requested.

July 8: An An audit of Facebook's practices found the platform continues to operate with glaring blind spots for hateful content and misinformation on the site, and has made a number of decisions in the last year that ""represent significant setbacks for civil rights."" Facebook has committed to hiring a senior executive with civil rights experience to oversee the company's application of civil rights priorities.

Civil rights and activist groups say they're not yet satisfied with Mark Zuckerberg's response to their calls for change at Facebook.

What's next?

At the moment, Facebook has a clear problem on its hands, especially after anti-hate advocates were not pleased with Zuckerberg's attempts to mollify their concerns. The ad boycott is unlike anything the platform has experienced in its recent history.

Still, whether the movement actually leads to long term change or a material impact on Facebook's finances remains to be seen.

While the companies boycotting the company are highly visible and have deep pockets, most of Facebook's ad revenue comes from small and medium-sized businesses, potentially insulating it from too much of a revenue shortfall from the boycott. And after the month long boycott period ends, some of the participating companies may be eager to get back to accessing Facebook's billions of users and valuable trove of user data.

Then there's Mark Zuckerberg , who exercises complete voting control over the company and can't be removed by shareholders, a factor that executives say could make Facebook less susceptible to outside pressure than most businesses.

Even in the midst of the controversy, Facebook is finding new opportunities.",2020-07-12,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/12/tech/facebook-content-moderation-controversy/index.html
Stella Chan,Tech CEO resigns after video shows his racist rant towards Asian-American family at California restaurant,"(CNN) The CEO of a San Francisco-based technology company who was seen in a viral video making racist remarks against an Asian-American family has resigned from his company.

In the video , which was posted last week by Jordan Chan on Instagram, Lofthouse calls the group ""Asian pieces of sh--,"" among other vulgarities, at the Lucia Restaurant at the Bernardus Lodge in Carmel Valley.

""This is the face of the man who relentlessly harassed my family and I completely UNPROVOKED, UNWARRANTED, and UNCONSCIONABLE,"" Chan wrote in her Instagram post.

In an email to CNN, Michael Lofthouse said, ""I can confirm that I have stepped down from Solid8, terminating all business relationships with immediate effect."" The CEO added, ""I will make it my duty to ensure my personal actions do not continue to have a detrimental impact on those people closest to me.""

Chan said she and her family were celebrating her aunt's birthday on July 4 when Lofthouse started yelling and insulting her family with racist remarks such as ""F--- you Asians,"" ""Go back to whatever f---ing Asian country you're from,"" and ""You don't belong here.""

Kathryn Vasel,Food is a big deal at work. Here's how the pandemic will change lunch and snacks,"Whether it's free lunches every day, or an occasional perk like pizza or bagels to celebrate an accomplishment, or an extra long meeting with a catered lunch, employers often use free food to reward or motivate their staff.

But workplace lunches could look very different when employees return to the office.

A packed cafeteria, buffet-style meals in conference rooms or buzzing elevators filled with lunch goers at noon won't bode well for social distancing.

""You can't have 40 people in a factory trying to get out the tiny entrance and drive off to Chipotle to wait in line for 30 minutes. That is a very unsafe thing to do,"" said Diane Swint, head of marketplace at ezCater, a corporate catering marketplace. ""In a high rise, you can't have folks all try to pile into an elevator.""

Some companies are switching to individualized boxed meals at work.

Real estate and investment management firm, JLL, has seen a bigger focus on safety from its clients.

""Health and safety are front and center, and that includes how employees access food,"" said Tom Larance, JLL's head of experience management.

""We have had several clients come to us and ask about how we can work with them to safely provide food -- whether that means providing lunches for employees so they do not need to venture out of the office, or if they need food and beverage service for small gatherings they are having within the office.""

Boxed lunches

Before coronavirus, company review website Glassdoor served employees a daily buffet-style lunch at its headquarters. It also offered snacks and drinks in the communal kitchens across its six offices.

But if lunch is provided when employees return to the office it will be different.

""[I]t will likely be individually boxed and either distributed by an individual wearing gloves and face covering or will be laid out on tables for employees to queue up and pick up,"" wrote Rick Friedman, Glassdoor's senior director of global real estate and workplace experience, in an email to CNN Business.

Snacks could be in prepackaged boxes that are distributed twice a day. Drinks will be limited in the fridge with new safety protocols regarding the use of hand sanitizer and paper towels when opening the refrigerators, he added.

""We'll also have signage that reminds people 'if you touch it, you take it.'""

Along the same lines, community coffee pots are likely to go away. ""Some employers are transitioning employees away from a communal coffee pot and are supplying them with discounts or gift cards to local coffee shops or supplying travel mugs to bring in their own,"" said Angela Simpson, human resource knowledge advisor at the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM).

She added that cafeterias could shift to offering more pre-packaged meals and brown bag lunches.

Convene, a co-working space with 30 locations across the country, used to offer buffets and food stations prepped in its kitchens for meetings and events for its members. Now, it's serving individually-packaged meals.

Having food delivered to the office with designated drop off points helps reduce contact.

Before the pandemic, workers were able to order food on Convene's app and it was delivered directly to their desks or sent to a pickup location. Now, workers get an alert when their food is ready and has been placed in a designated pickup zone on their floor to help minimize contact and exposure.

Community breakfasts and lunches are also going to look a little different. Instead of people congregating in a common space to eat, individually-wrapped meals will be at a pickup station to minimize contact.

Kitchen staff members also face increased safety measures. They have to change into a company-provided uniform and have their temperature checked before entering the space. They've also reduced the number of vendors they work with that provide food and other supplies.

""We want to limit the amount of traffic that comes through our doors,"" said German Villatoro, director of culinary at Convene. ""We are making things in-house as much as possible,"" he added.

Robots, apps and other alternatives to the cafeteria

Some workplaces are turning to robots to provide food safety. California-based Chowbotics, has seen an uptick in demand for its fresh food robot ""Sally."" Sally can whip up a variety of cold meals, including salads, grain bowls and yogurt.

Before the pandemic, one place Sally was often used was in hospitals after the cafeteria closed. Now, the machine is replacing the salad bar in the cafeteria, according to CEO Rick Wilmer.

A rendering of Chowbotics' salad-making robot called Sally that some companies are using to replace the salad bar.

He said the number of inquiries the company has received about Sally quadrupled in June compared to April and May.

EzCater said it has seen a five-fold increase in corporate orders of individually-packaged meals since the end of March.

The company recently launched a new app called Relish that allows workers to place food orders from designated restaurants. By ordering in through one source, crowded elevators can be avoided and the number of delivery people coming in is also reduced as individually-packaged meals arrive in a designated space and at a specified time, the company said.

Employers who use Relish can choose to set up a subsidy of 0% to 100% of meals. ""Right now, the majority of businesses are picking up the tab, but we do know that some of our current customers are going to be shifting off to a lower subsidy come August,"" said Swint.

Breakfast orders have to be put in the night before and lunch orders have a 10:00 am deadline. Upon delivery, orders are placed at designated spot like shelves or lockers for contactless pickup.

""Companies can stagger lunch times in a socially distant way. You can set up two or three lunch hours,"" said Swint.",2020-07-13,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/13/success/food-office-coronavirus/index.html
Analysis Laura He,China and India are sparring but neither can afford a full-on trade war,"Hong Kong (CNN Business) Last month's deadly border battle between India and China has already begun to affect business and technology. But the world's two most populous countries have a lot to lose should the dispute escalate into a full-on trade war.

New Delhi has indicated that it is willing to exert economic pressure on its neighbor. Trade organizations in the country reported last week that Chinese shipments were suddenly being held up at Indian checkpoints, while authorities in one state paused hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Chinese business deals. And earlier this week India took the dramatic step of banning dozens of mobile apps, including well-known Chinese ones like ByteDance's TikTok,WeChat, and social media network

The backlash has reached the highest political levels: Weibo said this week that it had removed Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's account at the Indian government's request.

Beijing's response so far has been cautious. Chinese officials said Tuesday that they were ""strongly concerned"" about the app ban, for example, but they did not threaten any kind of retaliation. And on Friday, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stressed that the two countries should work together, adding that barriers to cooperation ""will harm India's interests."" Some Chinese state media have called for ""cooler"" heads to prevail.

""As of now, China is only assessing the situation,"" said Geethanjali Nataraj, an economics professor at the Indian Institute of Public Administration (IIPA). A ""trade war is not going to benefit either of the countries,"" she added.

China's tough line

China has plenty of leverage, if it chooses to retaliate for India's app ban.

It has long been a critical trade partner for India. From April 2019 to March 2020, India bought $65 billion worth of goods from China, accounting for nearly 14% of its total imports, according to Indian government data. Meanwhile, China bought $16.6 billion worth of goods from India. China was India's second largest trading partner for that period behind the United States, though that value of trade does not include Hong Kong.

India accounts for a much smaller share of China's total trade. Exports to India comprised only 3% of China's total in 2019, according to Chinese government statistics. And India was only China's 12th biggest trade partner last year.

But analysts who spoke to CNN Business stressed that any kind of warfare, economic or otherwise, with an Asian neighbor would be costly for Beijing. The world's second largest economy is already managing pressures on several fronts, including a Western backlash over a new, controversial security law for Hong Kong and its handling of the coronavirus pandemic. China is also managing its own economic struggles, including a historic first-quarter contraction and rising unemployment.

""China is holding a tough line on the territorial dispute with India, but it doesn't want to see a confrontation,"" according to Deng Yuwen, a researcher at the US-based think tank China Strategic Analysis Center, who detailed his thoughts in a video posted online last month.

Nataraj of the IIPA pointed out that China also likely doesn't want to jeopardize its trading relationship with India, either, given the fact that the country still sends tens of billions of dollars of goods to India each year.

""Chinese companies are already facing trade restrictions from [the United States] and other countries, and they are faced with over capacity,"" she said. ""Therefore, it is not easy for China to ignore a big market like India.""

Even so, there are political considerations at play for Beijing. Deng said that China can't be too ""soft"" on territorial disputes, or else it could risk angering the public.

""The Chinese public doesn't think China should give in to India,"" Deng added. ""In the people's perspective, China and India are like two boxers of different weight classes. It shouldn't be hard for the heavyweight to defeat the lightweight."" (India does, however, have significant experience with ground combat and air forces, and recent studies suggest the country maintains an edge in high-altitude mountainous environments, such as the one where the 2020 face-off is taking place.)

India's dilemma

India, meanwhile, is likely to ""lose more"" from engaging in a trade war with China, according to Nataraj.

Like many other countries, Asia's third-largest economy has been hit hard by the pandemic and the lockdown measures it imposed to prevent the virus from spreading. Industrial production shrank dramatically this spring, while the services industry collapsed. Business activity was still struggling through June , according to data about the services sector released Friday.

Nataraj said that many industries in India — including electronics, pharmaceuticals and IT hardware — are heavily dependent on imports, particularly from China.

Shipping and delivery companies have confirmed that the dispute is already causing disruption. DHL Express India told CNN Business on Friday that it is ""temporarily suspending pick up of import shipments from mainland China, Hong Kong and Macao due to recent delays in customs clearance of shipments into India."" And FedEx said that it is ""currently facing backlogs beyond our control, leading to congestion at our facilities.""

""Though there is nothing wrong in [being] vocal for local [business], the immediate short term anti-China momentum would affect the supply chain of Indian production networks,"" Nataraj said, adding that arbitrary import restrictions or consumer boycotts will be largely ""self-defeating.""

Potential retaliation

Even if both countries have reason to not engage in a trade war, analysts pointed out that raw emotions could push them toward escalation.

""There is a clear understanding in India that China could retaliate and that India is more dependent on Chinese products than the other way round, but the mood in India is one of acute resentment and anger,"" according to Kanti Bajpai, a professor at the National University of Singapore who studies Indian foreign policy and India-China relations. At least 20 Indian soldiers died during June's clash with Chinese troops in the Himalayas, according to the Indian army

""If the confrontation persists, Delhi may take economic actions on trade as well,"" Bajpai added.

In retaliation, Beijing could ""slow walk"" some of the market access it has promised India in areas such as pharmaceuticals and agriculture, according to Rick Rossow, the Wadhwani Chair in US-India Policy Studies at the Washington-based Center for Strategies and International Studies.

China could also pull back on new investments it was looking to make in India, he said.

Investment from China has poured into Indian startups and manufacturing but it was already becoming a point of contention. In April, the Indian government announced that foreign direct investment from countries that share a land border with India would be subject to more scrutiny.

""The economic consequences of these moves are likely to be modest initially, but the bigger impact could come if India decides to break away from China and secure stronger strategic ties with countries such as the United States, Japan, Australia and France,"" Rossow added.

Jill Disis,The worst is yet to come for India's slowing economy,"Hong Kong (CNN Business) India's economy kicked off 2020 with its weakest quarter in at least eight years. But the biggest drop is yet to come.

GDP expanded by 3.1% in the three months to March, according to government data published Friday. That was a faster pace than economists had expected, but still the weakest figure since comparable record keeping began in 2012.

India's economy had been slowing down well before the coronavirus pandemic hit, with the rate of expansion slumping to about half of what it was three years ago as consumer demand waned and the country's automotive sector struggled

But more pain is on the way for Asia's third-biggest economy. The data for the first three months of the year doesn't fully capture the impact of a nationwide lockdown imposed in late March as authorities sought to stem the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.

The lockdown has led to significant decline in activity, according to Shilan Shah, senior India economist at Capital Economics. He said in a research note published before the GDP data was released that ""almost every economic indicator"" has experienced the ""sharpest drop on record."" Capital Economics had forecast a 1.5% contraction for the quarter.

Priyali Sur,Many Indian citizens believe their government is trying to steal and sell their data. Here's why,"New Delhi (CNN Business) When India launched its coronavirus tracing app Aarogya Setu in April , it came with a mandatory download order for public sector workers.

That order soon spread to private sector workers and then to people living in designated Covid-19 containment zones —includingRajeev Ghosh, a 50-year old chemist who resides in Noida, a city east of the capital New Delhi.

Back in May, he risked a six-month prison sentence or $15 fine for refusing to download the app. Ghosh didn't care: He had bigger concerns about the future use of his data.

""I am not sure how the government will use my data. If they want, they can do surveillance on me forever through location-tracking on the app,"" said Ghosh.

Ghosh is not alone in his concerns. In Noida, privacy activists mounted a legal challenge to the mandatory download order, and by the end of May it was lifted. They argued that it breached personal liberties protected by a landmark Supreme Court ruling about the right to privacy in 2017

The Indian government maintains that most personal and location data of users is ultimately deleted, but critics say India's lack of data protection laws exposes millions of people to potential privacy breaches. They also fear that personal information could be sold by the government to private companies, or even used for surveillance beyond Covid-19 concerns.

Millions of users

The Aarogya Setu app was developed by the National Informatics Centre, an ICT and e-governance body under the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, in collaboration with voluntary technical experts from private industry and academia.

June, it had been downloaded over By the beginning ofJune, it had been downloaded over 120 million times

Unlike many other countries' contact tracing apps, Aarogya Setu uses Bluetooth and GPS location data to monitor the app users' movement and proximity to other people.

Users are asked to input their name, phone number, age, gender, profession and the countries they have visited in the past 30 days, as well as prior health conditions and a self-assessment about any Covid-19-related symptoms.

A unique digital ID (DiD) is generated for each user, which is used for all future app-related transactions. Through GPS, the app records each users' location every 15 minutes.

When two registered users come within Bluetooth range of each other, their apps automatically exchange DiDs and record the time and location. If one of the users tests positive for Covid-19, the information is uploaded from their phone onto the Indian government's server and used for contact tracing.

As of June 1st, Aarogya Setu had identified 200,000 at-risk people and 3,500 Covid-19 hotspots, according to lead developer Lalitesh Katragadda, the founder of Indihood, a private firm that builds crowdsourcing population-scale platforms, and one of the private industry volunteers who worked with government agencies on the app.

""We have a 24% efficacy rate, that is, 24% of all the people estimated to have Covid-19 because of the app have tested positive,"" said Katragadda. This means that only about 1 in 4 people advised by the app to get a test actually tests positive.

Subhashis Bannerjee, professor of computer science and engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi, said the combination of Bluetooth and GPS location would likely return a higher rate of false positives and false negatives. For example, GPS is often unavailable or unreliable indoors, and Bluetooth overestimates the risks in large open spaces, across walls and floors, which radio waves can penetrate but the virus cannot.

""There seems to be a leap of faith from GPS colocation and Bluetooth radio proximity to estimating a risk score for infection transmission,"" he wrote in a report for the Internet Freedom Foundation (IFF), a non-governmental organization that advocates for digital rights, which has mounted a legal challenge against the mandatory download order in Kerala High Court.

Government safeguards

The Indian government states that enough privacy and protection parameters have been built in to ensure permanent deletion of the app's data.

""All contact tracing and location data on the phone is deleted on a rolling 30-day cycle. The same data on the server is deleted 45 days from the upload unless you test positive. In which case all contact tracing and location information is deleted after 60 days after being declared cured,"" said Abhishek Singh, CEO of MyGov at India's IT ministry.

However, the Aarogya Setu Data Access and Knowledge Sharing Protocol states that de-identified (anonymous) data can be shared with any government ministry or institution, as long as it's for the purpose of tackling Covid-19. Any data received should be permanently deleted after 180 days, the protocol says. But privacy campaigners say there's no way of knowing if that's happened.

""There is no way to check and verify whether the complete destruction of data has taken place and if any third parties with whom the data is shared has also destroyed it,"" said Apar Gupta, a lawyer and executive director of the IFF.

In response to calls for more transparency, the Indian government opened up the app's source code on May 27 and announced a bug bounty program to incentivize software experts to find security vulnerabilities in the app, to rectify lapses, if any.

of ""This is a step in the right direction but to know the full picture of who has access to the data, we need the server code also,"" said Robert Baptiste, an ethical hacker who goes by the aliasof Elliot Alderson and exposed security flaws in the app soon after its launch. An open server code would enable experts to see what citizen data is stored in the government server and how the data is shared.

On June 1, Singh of MyGov, said the government planned to release the server code in a few weeks.

However, Katragadda said that even with the server code, access to information on data sharing would be restricted.

""It will never be possible to see exactly with whom the data is shared because for that we will have to open source the entire government,"" he said.

No data protection laws

One of the main concerns that activists have is that India does not have a data protection law, though a bill is currently being reviewed by a joint select committee and could be passed later this year.

The Personal Data Protection Bill imposes limits on how residents' personal data is used, processed and stored. If passed, the bill would also establish a new regulatory body — the Data Protection Authority (DPA) — to monitor compliance. Critics say the bill is flawed for a number of reasons, including that it allows the government to exempt its departments from the legislation on the basis of national security.

But right now, there are few safeguards for data in India.

""No legislative framework means no official level of accountability. So, if any data mishap happens, there will be no penalty, there will be no safeguards,"" said Gupta.

There's also a financial incentive for the government to share information. The National Economic Survey of India 2018-19 openly states that the Indian government will monetize citizens' data and sell it to private companies to generate revenue.

""India has made a strategy to sell citizen data and is thus making it a commodity by claiming ownership over Indians' personal data, which is against Indians' fundamental right to privacy,"" said Kodali, the public interest technologist.

Last year, the Modi government sold citizens' vehicular registration and driving license data to 87 private companies for 65 crore rupees (approximately $8.7 million) without citizens' consent. This caused a backlash with the opposition party questioning the motives of the government and the price of the sale in parliament.

Despite the government's assurances that all Aarogya Setu data will be deleted, Katragadda told CNN Business that some information from the app will be automatically transferred to the National Health Stack (NHS). The NHS is a cloud-based health registry, currently under development, that will include citizens' medical history, insurance coverage and claims.

""Any residual data from the Aarogya Setu app will automatically move into the National Health Stack within the consent architecture, as soon as the health stack comes into effect,"" said Katragadda.

Residual data means any data that's still on the govt server at the time the NHS becomes active. That includes location, health and personal data that has been downloaded to the server but hasn't yet been deleted in the timeframes laid out by the government, Katragadda said.

No date has been set for the release of the NHS, but Gupta of IFF worries, again, that there's no legal framework to protect the data.

""Even though it is repeatedly stated that consent will be the basis of the information sharing, it's important to note that in both the Aarogya Setu app and NHS, consent is baked into the architecture which is a technical framework rather than a clear source of legal authority.""

Ticket to move

Like other countries that have introduced a contact tracing app, India says the technology is vital to stop the virus from spreading. As of June 22, the country had confirmed more than 410,000 cases and 13,254 deaths.

Air passengers are encouraged to download the app before flights, rail passengers need it for train travel, and some workers have been told they need it to do their jobs.

But digital rights activists say the app carries more risks than it's worth, especially in a country where fewer than 35% of people have the cellphones able to support it.

Citizens and activists also fear function creep of the app, meaning that information obtained through the app could be linked to other services.

""In the past we have seen that technology interventions by this government such as the Aadhar program, which was initially built to ensure that everyone has a digital identity, became a pervasive system, said Gupta.

""Initially built for the purposes of accessing government benefits and subsidies, it was soon mandated for opening bank accounts, availing mobile numbers and going about your business.""

Gupta is referring to Aadhaar, a biometric database introduced in 2009 , initially as a voluntary program to prevent benefit fraud. Now, it contains the fingerprints and iris scans of more than one billion Indians. Users receive a 12-digit identity number that is used to access welfare payments and other government-controlled services.

However, in 2018 a journalist discovered a security breach which disclosed citizens' personal details. The government introduced new security measures, but the scandal eroded trust in its ability to keep data safe.

Before easing off its compulsory download order, India was the only democratic country that made it mandatory for millions of citizens to download the app. The only other countries to impose a similar order were Turkey and China. Campaigners say that alone is cause for concern.

""When it comes to technology and public use, the world's largest democracy is drawing from China's playbook — using national security or a public health crisis to build a digital model of data-gathering, oversight and surveillance,"" said Vidushi Marda, a lawyer working on emerging technology and human rights.

China's Covid-19 app , initially designed for contact-tracing during the pandemic, is now being stitched into a social credit system in some places, where the app is used to track an individual's exercise, alcohol and smoking intake, and sleep hours.

""I would say these kinds of complex technical architectures are not happening in a collective fashion in India, but there is a danger they will be built in through platforms like the National Health Stack,"" said Gupta.",2020-06-21,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/21/tech/india-privacy-app-hnk-intl/index.html
Kathryn Vasel,Do you feel like you belong at work?,"Editor's Note: A version of this story appeared in CNN's Work Transformed newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here .

Be honest: How much do you feel like you belong at work?

It might sound like an odd question, but the answer is important.

Feeling like you're part of the team and you're being seen and supported at work is a big part of being happy in your career, reports CNN Business' Jeanne Sahadi. Employees that have a sense of belonging are more likely to stay and succeed -- which is good news for employers.

But a new study found that White workers report a higher sense of belonging than their Black, Hispanic and Asian colleagues.

""Employees who belong to groups that have not traditionally been represented in the workplace step into their careers at a disadvantage, and begin a journey riddled with reminders that they're outside the norm; that they are 'other,'"" the report notes.

So what can employers do to help promote a better sense of belonging?

To start, they should proactively and regularly check in with employees given all the stresses of the world right now, Sahadi writes. The key is to listen to their concerns and identify ways you can help address some of the worries.

Providing regular feedback is also important -- this allows workers a chance to adjust their performance to meet expectations. But it needs to be honest and specific in order to be helpful.

Increasing accessibility to senior leaders can also lead to a better sense of belonging in the workplace.

Saving more American jobs

Here's a title that no country wants: Home of the largest increase in unemployment of any major economy.

But here we are.

And now it's time for Congress to act in order to restore and preserve US jobs, writes Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics; Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and Antonio Weiss, a research fellow at Harvard Kennedy School's Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government, for CNN Business' Perspectives.

The coronavirus is a worldwide problem, but other countries, like Germany and Australia, have employee retention programs that have kept a lid on unemployment rates, they note.

The plans provide government funding to companies in order to keep employees on the payroll during times of economic uncertainty. They help families make ends meet and also put less stress on the country's unemployment insurance system.

Additionally, having workers stay connected to their employers can lead to a smoother and stronger recovery, according to the trio.

But there could be some drawbacks to retention programs if they remain in place too long, including higher unemployment and lower economic growth. And, of course, there is also the cost to consider.

Don't hold your breath

It's going to be a long time before we see unemployment fall back to pre-pandemic levels.

In February, the unemployment rate was 3.5%. The Congressional Budget Office said last week that it estimates the rate will remain well above that level until after 2030.

What's more, the 10-year average unemployment rate is projected to be 6.1%, a big increase from the 4.2% rate that was predicted in January, reports CNN Business' Anneken Tappe.

But given that so much is still unknown, including shifts in consumer behavior (what changes will stick and what are temporary?) and even the virus itself (how and when will it go away?) the agency warned the forecast hinges on a lot of uncertainty.

Generation Z's rough entry into working life

Internships. First jobs. Gearing up for college.

For many Gen Z'ers, this was supposed to be a big summer.

But then the pandemic hit. And everyone's plans came to a screeching halt.

The pain of the Covid Recession is widespread, but for the younger generation, the scars are going to run deep.

Members of Gen Z had the potential to narrow the inequality gap in America, writes CNN Business' Jazmin Goodwin. Their earning potential was promising, and the labor market was tight, resulting in companies widening their applicant pools. All good news for young job seekers and closing the economic disparity gap.

Oh what a difference a few months can make.

Now, Gen Z'ers could face a permanent decline in earnings. And Black youth could be hit particularly hard. This group faces higher unemployment and often earns less than their White peers with the same levels of education, reports Goodwin.

And while the current economic climate can be detrimental to all young workers, it's even harder for young Black workers to overcome.

Brian Fung,Wells Fargo tells employees to delete TikTok from their company devices,"(CNN Business) Wells Fargo has banned the social media app TikTok from company devices amid what it says are concerns about security.

In a statement to CNN Business on Monday, a Wells Fargo spokesperson said the company had identified a ""small number of employees with corporate-owned devices who had installed the TikTok application.""

""Due to concerns about TikTok's privacy and security controls and practices, and because corporate-owned devices should be used for company business only, we have directed those employees to remove the app from their devices,"" the statement said.

The ban was first reported by The Information . TikTok told CNN Business on Monday it has not been contacted by Wells Fargo.

In a statement, a TikTok spokesperson said the company is open to engaging with Wells Fargo ""and sharing the actions we take to protect data security for our users.

Alexis Benveniste,Elon Musk's brother wants to transform farming,"New York (CNN Business) Plant-based foods are all the rage right now, and vertical farms are capitalizing on the trend.

Vertical farming is an indoor farming method in which crops are grown in stacked layers, often without soil. The practice is becoming more popular and important as urban populations grow dramatically and available farmland decreases.

While vertical farming isn't a new concept, these eco-friendly indoor farms are now rapidly expanding.

Elon Musk's younger brother, Kimbal Musk , who was named ""Global Social Entrepreneur"" of the year by the World Economic Forum in 2017, started Square Roots, an indoor urban farming company based in Brooklyn, in 2016. Square Roots' mission is to bring fresh, local food to cities around the world by empowering younger generations to participate in urban farming.

""When I was a kid, the only way I could get my family to sit down and connect was by cooking the meal,"" Musk, co-founder and executive chairman of Square Roots, told CNN Business in an email.

Kimbal Musk teaches students how to plant a vegetable garden in California.

""Getting involved with the internet, especially in the late 90's, was very exciting and I wouldn't change anything about those experiences, but my passion has always been food,"" Musk said. ""The moment Elon and I sold Zip2, our first internet company, I knew I wanted to pursue food and become a trained chef."" He moved to New York and enrolled at the International Culinary Center.

Musk said the company plans to open a Square Roots ""Super Farm"" — with 25 climate-controlled shipping containers, cold storage, biosecurity infrastructure and everything else needed to run a vertical farm at scale — in less than three months.

Since its inception, Square Roots has grown more than 120 varieties of crops, including greens, vegetables and strawberries.

The company isn't the first of its kind. Startups like Silicon Valley's Plenty, which was founded in 2013 and is backed by Jeff Bezos, are also beginning to dominate the space.

""Environmentalists, urban farmers, architects, agronomists, and public health experts, among others, have been joining this mini revolution as they partner to work out a way to salvage a food-scarce, ultra-urbanized future,"" Kheir Al-Kodmany, a professor of sustainable urban design at the University of Illinois at Chicago, said in a report.

It involves various techniques, such as hydroponics, which uses mineral nutrient solutions in a water solvent; aquaponics, which uses aquatic creatures -- such as fish and snails -- and cultivates plants in water; and aeroponics, which grows plants in the air.

As for job creation, rapid climate change will put millions of traditional farmers out of business, but vertical farmers won't be affected, according to microbiologist Dickson Despommier, an emeritus professor of public and environmental health at Columbia University.

Although vertical farming was first introduced in the early 1900s, it was recently popularized by Despommier. More than 20 years ago, he began teaching a class at Columbia called Medical Ecology.

Despommier spent a decade growing crops indoors with his students. ""Ten years ago, there were no vertical farms,"" he said, noting that LED grow lights have vastly improved farming efficiency over the last five years, making indoor growing cheaper and more reliable.

Basil growing at the Square Roots farm in Brooklyn.

""People want local food because they've lost trust in the industrial food system that ships in high calorie, low nutrient food from thousands of miles away with little transparency as to who grew the food and how,"" said Peggs, the Square Roots CEO.

At the same time, the world population is growing and urbanizing rapidly. Peggs said climate change is threatening existing supplies of food, forcing the industry to figure out new ways to grow food quickly.

Peggs is optimistic about raising money for vertical farming. ""A lot of smart money and capital is entering the space,"" he said. ""The quality of food that can now be produced in these indoor systems is at least on par with the best organic field grown food you can buy.""

Despommier said that cities will eventually be able to grow ""all they can eat"" from indoor farms located within city limits. ""If an outdoor farm fails, the farmer has to wait until next year to start again, he said. ""Indoor farms fail too, but the indoor farmer can start again within weeks.""",2020-02-28,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/02/28/business/musk-vertical-farm/index.html
Hanna Ziady,Britain has to solve its heating problem to meet its ambitious climate goals,"London (CNN Business) The United Kingdom made history last year when it became the first major economy to commit to pumping no more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than it removes by 2050.

Dozens of countries have since followed its lead to achieve ""net zero"" emissions, and with three decades to go before the deadline, Britain's progress provides a promising blueprint

Its carbon emissions were 44% below 1990 levels in 2018, with renewable energy now accounting for 33% of its energy mix and coal contributing just over5%. That is thanks in large part to its success with offshore wind and focus on nuclear energy.

But the Committee on Climate Change, an independent advisory body, warns the country must do more to meet its carbon reduction targets for 2023 to 2027. And climate activists say the government should aim for ""net zero"" much sooner than 2050.

Heating homes

By far the biggest threat to the United Kingdom's 2050 ambition comes from the way it heats its homes, schools and hospitals.

More than 80% of homes are connected to the gas grid, according to Ian Radley, head of gas operations at National Grid.

While natural gas emits less carbon than coal, Britain's heavy dependence on the fossil fuel is deemed unsustainable. Heat is responsible for around half of all UK CO2 emissions, according to HyDeploy, a consortium that is currently piloting hydrogen as an alternative to gas.

In other words, the UK government's £1.5 billion ($2 billion) investment into reducing emissions from road transport won't be enough to meet its 2050 target if it doesn't also tackle heating.

""The heating story is the one that usually just gets neglected. It's in the box called 'too difficult,'"" Dieter Helm, professor of energy policy at Oxford University, told CNN Business. ""How are you going to heat your house and do your cooking without natural gas? The answer to that question is at considerable expense.""

A 2018 report commissioned by the National Infrastructure Commission, a government agency, found that decarbonizing Britain's heating infrastructure could cost as much as £450 billion ($586 billion).

The total cost of decarbonization could exceed £1 trillion ($1.3 trillion), according to the Committee on Climate Change.

Among the proposed solutions to the domestic heating challenge: stop connecting new homes to the gas grid, while encouraging existing homeowners to move to energy efficient alternatives such as hydrogen boilers.

Repurposing existing infrastructure will be critical. HyDeploy is conducting experiments at the University of Keele to establish how much hydrogen can be blended into the national grid as a replacement to gas, without people needing to buy new heating or cooking appliances. Hydrogen offers many of the benefits of natural gas, without the carbon emissions.

Production versus consumption

For Helm, even if the United Kingdom achieves its target in terms of power production, consumption is what ultimately matters.

""If we reduce carbon emissions in Britain but simply close down our large industries and import the stuff from China instead, then global warming will be worse off,"" Helm said. ""The thing about carbon is it doesn't matter where it's emitted,"" he added, arguing that a carbon border tax is the only way to encourage all countries to decarbonize and ensure that ""the polluter pays wherever the polluter is.""

Carbon pricing mechanisms were discussed at December's UN climate summit in Madrid, but no agreement was reached on how to create a global carbon market where, for example, countries could trade greenhouse gas emission credits.

made by major economies will be scrutinized, particularly following the The United Kingdom will host this year's summit in Glasgow in November, and the progressmade by major economies will be scrutinized, particularly following the disappointing outcome in Madrid.

The United Kingdom must have ""made credible plans"" to meet its 2050 target by then, according to Chris Stark, CEO of the Committee on Climate Change.

""The next 12 months are likely to be the most important yet in defining the UK's climate credentials,"" Stark wrote in a recent blog post.

Story Nathaniel Meyersohn,"Dollar General is cheap, popular and spreading across America. It's also a robbery magnet, police say","In the year before Dave Dukes killed a man who was trying to rob the store where he worked, he'd witnessed three other robberies.

After each of them, Dukes, 28, would say later, he'd asked his supervisors at Dollar General to put in a security guard.

But, according to Dukes, his bosses didn't do that — though, because of how many robberies he'd been through, they did start sending him out to train employees at other stores.

After the third robbery, Dukes started bringing a gun to work.

Then, in October 2019, the fourth robbery happened.

According to the local prosecutor's office, a man entered the store with a gun and demanded money from the cashier. When Dukes tried to intervene, the man — Roosevelt Rappley, just 23 years old — pointed his gun at Dukes. Then Dukes pulled out his own gun and shot Rappley, killing him.

A grand jury in Ohio reviewed the case and found Dukes ""acted lawfully under the circumstances,"" according to the prosecutor's office.

But by then Dukes was out of a job, allegedly having been fired by Dollar General for violating company policy. Dollar General's 2019 policy said that possession of a firearm on the company premises may result in termination.

Dave Dukes stands in his lawyer's office in Dayton, Ohio in March. Dukes was a Dollar General clerk who shot and killed a man during an armed robbery. It was the fourth robbery he had witnessed on the job.

Dollar General declined to say why Dukes was terminated, saying in an email that it does not comment publicly on specific employment situations. The company said it does not retaliate ""against employees who make good faith reports of safety concerns."" It also maintains that the safety of its employees is a top priority.

Rappley's family is still trying to process his death eight months after the robbery. Rappley's sister Jasmine Jessery said in an interview that she didn't hold a grudge toward Dukes. ""He was protecting himself,"" she said.

Jessery described her brother as a kind person who had linked up with the wrong crowd. ""Everything went sour"" then, she said.

A thriving business

Business is booming at Dollar General, the chain adding more stores every year than any other retailer in America. That was the case even before the coronavirus pandemic, but Dollar General has been in an even stronger position during the pandemic as price-conscious consumers stock up on essential items.

Former executives, store employees, law enforcement officials and retail security experts told CNN Business that while the company's low-cost, no-frills model might be embraced by Wall Street, it is putting its workers at risk.

Dollar General stores, which process a high number of cash transactions, are a prime target for armed robberies, they said. Some of the former company officials and current and former employees spoke on the condition of anonymity either to discuss internal conversations or for fear that speaking out would impact their jobs.

Dark side of a booming business At a time when other retailers are struggling, Dollar General is thriving. The company plans to add 1,000 stores in 2020.

Meanwhile, insiders and security experts say the company is failing to protect workers from violent crime.

In Dayton, Ohio, seven Dollar General stores accounted for 29% of commercial robberies in 2019. Police say they had repeatedly recommended stores improve security measures.

At least six Dollar General employees have died during robberies since 2016, according to a review of news and police reports.

""Every night I was just waiting for there to be a phone call that said, 'Hey we've lost somebody,'"" Brian Flannery, who oversaw security at around 2,000 Dollar General stores in the northeast as a divisional loss prevention director from 2011 to 2015, said. ""It wasn't a matter there [of] if you were going to have a bad robbery. It was a matter of when.""

At least six Dollar General employees have died during robberies since 2016, according to a review of news and police reports. And while the FBI doesn't specifically track robberies at dollar stores as it does those which occur at convenience stores and gas stations — other robbery targets — police have warned company managers that its stores are vulnerable.

In a statement in response to this story, Dollar General said, ""We employ a number of measures designed to create and maintain a safe work environment for our employees and a safe shopping environment for our customers, all while protecting company assets.""

The company said its safety and security measures take federal and state laws, retail industry standards and law enforcement recommendations into account and its measures are ""designed to prevent, deter and if necessary, respond to criminal activity in our stores.""

""Our employees are our greatest asset. Their safety and security is of paramount importance,"" Dollar General added.

The problem of robberies isn't exclusive to Dollar General. In an interview with CNN Business, Jason Hall, a lieutenant with the Dayton Police Department, described local dollar stores as ""robbery magnets.""

He has tracked robberies at local chains including Dollar Tree, Family Dollar and Dollar General over the last few years — and Dollar General, by far, had the most incidents.

Lieutenant Jason Hall, photographed in March, says the Dayton Police Department repeatedly made security recommendations to dollar stores in the area but many of those recommendations were ignored.

In Dayton alone, police were called to 86 robberies at just seven Dollar General stores between 2016 and 2019. Robberies at Dollar General locations accounted for 29% of the 80 commercial robberies in the city in 2019, according to figures provided by the department.

Dollar General declined to comment on how much it spends annually on crime prevention or any specific measures in its stores to protect workers and prevent robberies ""as to do so potentially compromises the integrity of those measures, provides a roadmap to would-be wrongdoers and may place customers and employees at risk.""

Growing at a price

As other retailers have struggled in recent years, dollar stores have enjoyed breakneck growth. The Great Recession, slow wage growth and widening inequality in America had all boosted discount retailers. Now the pandemic is as well.

The two largest players are Dollar General and Dollar Tree, which bought Family Dollar in 2015.

There are a few differences between the chains. At Dollar Tree, for example, all items are exactly $1 . The stores tend to be in middle-class suburban areas.

Dollar General's more than 16,000 stores, on the other hand, sell items largely in the $1 to $10 range, meaning there is more cash in registers. That makes stores more susceptible to robberies, according to retail security experts.

""We do very good in good times and we do fabulous in bad times,"" Vasos said on a call with Wall Street analysts in May. ""We're very, very bullish on what post-Covid looks like because...I think we're very well positioned no matter what this economy does to both our core customer and to the customer overall.""

We do very good in good times and we do fabulous in bad times."" Todd Vasos, CEO, Dollar General

Investors like Dollar General because it's been relentless at making more with less: less real estate, less labor and smaller product sizes than its larger big-box competitors. In its latest fiscal year, Walmart's US stores had a 5.1% operating profit margin before taxes; Dollar General stores boasted an 8.3% margin — an indicator that Dollar General is more efficient at keeping costs low and turning sales into profits.

Since 2010 , Dollar General's annual profits have increased five-fold and its stock has surged more than 800%. Its locations have nearly doubled, and now the chain boasts more US stores than Walmart, Kroger, Costco and Home Depot combined. A record 25,000 retail stores are expected to close this year, but Dollar General still plans to open 1,000 new locations in 2020 , or roughly 20 new stores a week.

But the company's low-cost approach often comes at the expense of employees, former executives said. Efforts to keep costs down have also kept the company's leadership from wanting to take bigger steps on security, these executives said.

Visibility inside the stores is often poor for workers because of the design, according to law enforcement officials. Stores tend to be small and crowded, with high shelves and piles of boxes and carts lining the aisles. Some police patrolling outside complain that it's difficult to see inside because windows are covered with advertisements and signs.

Dollar General said in an email that ""we continually review and, as needed, adapt operating procedures and store layout [and] fixturing.""

Staffing is intentionally kept at a minimum, often with just one or two low-wage employees on site at any given time, former executives said. And although store registers are often flush with cash because it's what many customers use to pay, security guards are rarely on the premises.

The Dayton Police Department says in 2017 it recommended Dollar General keep its windows clear as a security precaution. This store on Dayton's Salem Avenue, which was the site of four robberies between 2018 and 2020, had its windows covered as of March 2020.

Security guards were viewed as costly to the company's bottom line, the former executives also said.

One former Dollar General executive described the difficulty in convincing other company leaders that security guards could deliver a positive return on investment. ""We certainly didn't get a return having somebody standing there and paying $10 or $12 an hour,"" the former executive said. ""Out of the 13,000 stores when I was there, probably less than 100 stores had some type of outside security.""

Another of the former Dollar General executives, who focused on security, said he was ""heavily chastised"" for frequently going over budget on monthly guard expenses.

Adding staff to stores would have also jeopardized the low-cost model.

""It's a low margin business, so you have to have low labor [costs] to make a profit,"" said one of the former executives. ""Putting more labor in the stores took away from the profit, or you have to raise prices. And there was no appetite to raise prices because it's a low-price business.""

The company has invested in interactive security monitoring services. At thousands of stores in higher-crime neighborhoods or that have experienced frequent incidents, cameras are monitored by offsite security agents. The agents can communicate with employees in the store and make public announcements over the loudspeakers letting customers know they are on camera.

If the agents see a robbery or suspicious activity at the store, they can alert the local police. There are also two-way phones and panic buttons that employees can press to talk directly with a security agent if they are in distress.

Interface Security Systems, one of the services that Dollar General uses, boasts on its website that its technology helps companies reduce security guard costs by 88%. Dollar General also has used iVerify, another off-site monitoring company. Earlier this year, Securitas Electronic Security acquired the customer contracts of iVerify.

This Dollar General store on N Gettysburg Ave in Dayton is where Dave Dukes said he experienced four robberies in just a year on the job.

The remote monitoring systems can be effective at deterring shoplifting inside the store, according to experts. But unlike human security guards who can act as a visible, physical deterrent, they are less effective at deterring robberies, according to police, former employees at iVerify and Interface, and retail security consultants.

One former iVerify executive said, ""it's rare that you're going to be looking at a video when the robbery occurs."" He said the remote monitoring was better-suited for investigating robberies after they occurred.

Securitas, the company that now owns iVerify's customer contracts, did not respond to request for comment. A representative for Interface said ""there is a place for both remote interactive monitoring and security guards in most retail chains"" and that its interactive remote monitoring systems with live video and two-way audio were a strong crime deterrent.

When robberies do occur, some of the former Dollar General executives said, the company offered reactive, short-term measures — such as adding a security guard to a store for a few weeks.

""It was literally whack-a-mole. You would get the okay to spend cash when there was an incident. A reactive security program in that kind of environment is not what you're looking for,"" said Flannery, the former divisional loss prevention director at Dollar General.

Dollar General said it disagreed with Flannery's characterization of its security efforts and that it doesn't believe ""those assertions are supported by facts.""

The safety concerns take a toll on some workers.

When Kenya Slaughter works the cash register at a Dollar General in Alexandria, Louisiana, she makes sure she has enough $1 and $10 bills in the drawer, so she won't have to go back into the safe. When she has to take out money from the safe behind the register, she ""strategically positions herself"" so she's not opening it with her back turned.

Still, potential robbers ""know we don't have security and that people are in there alone,"" she said.

Indeed, Dollar General employees told NBC News in a report last month that they've been stabbed, shot and held at gunpoint.

Significant 'shrink'

In recent years, Dollar General has focused on solving another problem.

Current and former staffers said there was an intense urgency to combat ""shrink"" — or merchandise lost due to shoplifting, employee theft or inventory errors. In its latest annual report filed in March , Dollar General called the problem ""significant,"" noting that ""higher rates of inventory shrinkage or increased security or other costs to combat inventory theft could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.""

The sources said they felt that the company prioritized reducing ""shrink"" over preventing robberies, which had a human toll.

""In the two years I sat in the executive meetings, I never remember anybody bringing up armed robberies as a problem. We talked about loss of product and store manager turnover,"" said one former top Dollar General executive. ""The people that are below the store manager level are just a commodity.""

The obsession with reducing shrink was often turned inward, with Dollar General treating some of its own workers with constant suspicion, said Tracy Vargas, an assistant professor of sociology and criminal justice at the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. Vargas worked as a clerk at Dollar General in 2014 and 2015 for her PhD dissertation on dollar stores at Syracuse University. She also interviewed 50 employees from across the country. In her dissertation, she described workers being treated like criminals with surveillance cameras often focused on their activities rather than on customers.

The people that are below the store manager level are just a commodity."" A former Dollar General executive

Dollar General said its ""understanding is that Ms. Vargas's employment with the company was intended solely to validate her preconceived notions regarding the company for purposes of a book that she was writing, rather than in furtherance of serving the customers and communities that rely on us.""

It added: ""We categorically deny the assertions.""

A 13-foot poster in the store backroom, known as the Shrink Chart, displayed performance statistics including the number of times each employee voided cash register transactions that week, Vargas said. (A large number of voided transactions or price checks could be interpreted by managers as a sign of employee theft.)

Meanwhile, Dollar General provides little training on how to handle robberies, sources told CNN Business.

Former store workers, including Dukes and Vargas, described when they were first hired being shown a simulation video of a robbery. There are no hands-on drills and they did not have to review the video annually, some of these sources said. In some stores, signs are posted in back rooms giving employees directions on what to do ""should the unlikely event of robbery occur.""

Vargas told CNN Business that Dollar General employees are ""sitting ducks"" and ""considered to be profit risks to the corporation's bottom line.""

""Employees are alone, exposed, and at the mercy of whomever [decides] to walk through the door that day,"" she said.

Law enforcement raises concerns

In some cities, local officials have urged Dollar General management to take more steps to prevent violent crime. They say their warnings have largely gone ignored.

Dayton police have prepared reports on crime at local Dollar General, Dollar Tree and Family Dollar stores. On February 1, 2017, members of the department presented a Dollar General divisional loss prevention director with a 32-slide PowerPoint deck detailing the factors the department believes to be ""enabling factors"" in robberies. The factors included blocked windows, high shelves, lack of maintenance outside the stores and lack of security guards in high-incident locations.

It's a ""fairly large issue for us,"" Hall, the Dayton Police Department lieutenant, told CNN Business. ""We've made a lot of recommendations to try to improve these situations. We have noticed that not many of these recommendations have been implemented or fully implemented.""

Dollar General said it ""enjoys frequent communication with the Dayton Police Department"" and that it implemented the department's exterior maintenance suggestions in 2017. The company claimed the department did not provide ""specific store safety and security measures.""

A representative for Dollar Tree, which owns Family Dollar, said ""working with and supporting local law enforcement is absolutely important to us. We continually refine our security program, which includes cooperating with local police departments to share photos and videos to support their investigations.""

In St. Louis, where there have been ""high calls for police service for larcenies, disturbances [and] hold-ups"" at Dollar General and Family Dollar in recent years, ""implementing security is often suggested and ignored,"" said Rich Sykora, an attorney for the city of St. Louis.

Lt. Hall described robberies at local dollar stores as a ""fairly large issue"" in the area. Seven Dollar General locations accounted for 29% of robberies at Dayton businesses in 2019, according to the department's data.

""We will take a fresh look at the St. Louis market and implement the appropriate steps,"" a Dollar Tree representative responded.

In rural Effingham County, Georgia, Sheriff Jimmy McDuffie said three of the five Dollar General stores in the area have been hit in recent years. ""We don't call them dollar stores. We call them stop and robs,"" he said.

McDuffie presented a list of safety concerns to Dollar General stores in the county, he said, including recommendations to improve lighting and limit the number of boxes piled up inside the stores, which can make it difficult for officers to see inside. ""Put in some security measures,"" he urged. ""Light the parking lots up.""

""They say they're going to do better, but it doesn't seem to come to fruition,"" he told CNN Business.

And in the Pee Dee region of South Carolina, there have been a string of robberies at Dollar General stores over the past year.

""None of the stores have added outside cameras that could potentially capture the mode of transportation and the direction of travel for suspects,"" said Tammy Erwin, a deputy at the Marion County Sheriff's Office in South Carolina.

""There are no security officers at any time. There are shifts with only one employee working in the entire store,"" she said. She added that she wonders why Dollar General won't implement ""a buddy-system of employees, so that no one is alone in the store.""

We don't call them dollar stores. We call them stop and robs."" Jimmy McDuffie, Sheriff, Effingham County, Georgia

Dollar General's 2019 handbook of operating procedures says ""at a minimum, two employees must be involved in the closing process. For safety purposes, always use the buddy system."" But there is no mention of similar policy for opening stores in the morning or at other hours of the day. The company says it ""tries to minimize the time that employees are alone in the store.""

The company said it has received ""no formal safety and security policy change"" from the sheriff's offices in Effingham County, Georgia, and Marion County, South Carolina.

Dollar General said it was ""aware of a single request from a member of law enforcement in St. Louis,"" who requested that Dollar General implement facial recognition software from a company ""in which we understood the individual to have a personal and financial interest.""

Deaths on the job

Family members of Dollar General employees killed during armed robberies and security experts say it's not just a lack of in-store security measures that are the problem.

Out of the six Dollar General employees killed since 2016, two were shot as they left stores to deposit cash from the register at the bank.

Some Dollar General employees take cash deposits to the bank by themselves: The company's policy in its 2019 store operating procedures says that stores should make one or two such deposits each day depending on their location, and that the deposits can only be made by ""key carriers,"" or high-ranking employees.

Ron Holder took a job as a store manager at a Dollar General in Richmond, Virginia, and hoped to work his way up the ranks at the company and become a district manager. But he was killed in his car outside of Dollar General one morning after picking up a cash deposit from the store, according to the FBI . His case is still unsolved.

In Houston, 20-year-old DeQuan Anderson was killed in 2017 as he got in his car to bring cash from the store to the bank. His mother, Janine, has filed a wrongful death lawsuit. The case has gone to arbitration.

Janine Anderson described her son in an interview as ""an all-around good kid"" who was active in his church and developed a love of photography in high school. He saved up money to buy a camera and equipment and took it everywhere he went.

""He always was going to have some type of career in art,"" she said. ""That was his passion.""

Before his death, DeQuan had raised concerns about the bank-drop process on multiple occasions, the lawsuit said. But despite previous robberies at the store, Dollar General did not increase its security or hire an outside security company to transport cash to the bank, the lawsuit alleges.

Dollar General declined to comment on pending litigation.

Meanwhile, Dukes, the former Dollar General employee in Dayton, Ohio, is trying to bounce back after the October robbery that changed his life. He has had trouble finding work after the shooting. He is hoping to be more present in his kids' lives.

""I don't regret anything that I did,"" he said. He was defending himself, he said.

But Dukes believes the robbery could have been avoided if Dollar General had taken his advice and put in permanent armed security. He hopes company executives will start doing more to protect their employees.

""They don't know what's going on inside these stores every day. They don't. Store managers are the ones that deal with that every day. But I would tell them that they need to take better care of their staff.""",2020-06-26,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/26/business/dollar-general-robberies/index.html
Danielle Wiener-Bronner,Why restaurant menus are getting shorter,"New York (CNN Business) Restaurants are reducing their menus to streamline their operations amid the coronavirus pandemic .

The industry has been hit hard by efforts to stop the spread of Covid-19. From March to May, eating and drinking place sales were $94 billion below expected levels, according to a recent survey by the National Restaurant Association. Reopening will be difficult as well. The slimmer menus are a way to shed complexities and costs, and push simpler or more popular items at a time when conserving cash is crucial for restaurant operators.

Here's what is off the menu

removed dishes like the Sizzlin' Supreme Skillet, Choconana Pancakes, Spicy Sriracha Burger, Fit Slam and Slow-Cooked Pot Roast from its dine-in menu through fall. ""When we realized the effects of the pandemic we quickly mobilized to create a new streamlined menu,"" said John Dillon, Denny's chief brand officer, in a statement emailed to CNN Business. Denny's, which still has plenty of options, is serving items that ""simplify operations and [are] easier to execute for our team members,"" he said.

IHOP used to have a 12-page menu. Now it's giving guests a 2-page, disposable menu. The shift ""required a lot of reductions,"" Brad Haley, IHOP's chief marketing officer, told CNN Business. IHOP held on to popular items that weren't too difficult to prepare. It lost complicated items that fewer guests ordered, and that could be replaced with something similar.

One example: a Simple and Fit omelet made with egg whites and spinach. While the specific dish is no longer on the menu, customers can build their own omelet using the same ingredients. ""We didn't lose any big menu categories, we just trimmed across the board,"" Haley said. A smaller menu makes it easier for IHOP to train new workers as it reopens. It also means less waste for franchise operators, who may throw out unused ingredients they buy for less popular menu items.

""I don't see us going back to the full 12-page menu,"" Haley said.

Dave & Buster's PLAY reduced its 40-item menu to 15 offerings, CEO Brian Jenkins said during a recent analyst call discussing the company's first quarter financial results. ""I do not expect that we will go back to the 40-item menu,"" he said.

McDonald's MCD ""transitioned to a limited menu in April,"" the company said in a statement to CNN Business, adding that ""this decision helped simplify operations for our restaurant crew while also improving our customers' experience.""

planning to this summer bring back a handful of the discontinued items. The chain axed salads, bagels, yogurt parfaits and all-day breakfast during the crisis, the Wall Street Journal reported . The company isplanning to this summer bring back a handful of the discontinued items.

out, restaurants have to reduce their capacities and keep people far enough apart to satisfy social distancing rules. Restaurant operators are in a tough spot. For months, their dining rooms were closed because of local social-distancing orders. Now, as many start to reopen their doors, they face uncertain territory. With unemployment so high , some people may decide that eating out is just too expensive. Others may be afraid to come into restaurants, where they worry they could get sick from staff or other customers . Even if diners are eager to goout, restaurants have to reduce their capacities and keep people far enough apart to satisfy social distancing rules.

Meanwhile, their costs are soaring. Restaurant operators have to pay for personal protective equipment for workers, lots of hand sanitizer, paper towels, contact-free payment systems and more. They may have to pay to redesign their dining rooms . And the cost of some ingredients, like meat , is way up.

Reducing menus could help. And, at least for now, customers don't seem to mind.

The problem with raising prices

Restaurants already operate with very thin margins, so it's difficult for them to absorb costs without making any changes.

One obvious way to cope with higher costs is by passing them on to customers via higher prices. But diners won't stand for it.

""What restaurants really hate is adding fees and doing things that frustrate the customer,"" said Sean Kennedy, the National Restaurant Association's Executive Vice President for Public Affairs.

If customers see prices go up, they may turn to a competitor. Or they might just eat at home.

""There's a lot of options outside of restaurant meals,"" said Tim Powell, a managing principal of Foodservice IP, a foodservice consulting firm. ""If you start raising prices it means that there's a good chance that demand, or the traffic, will go down.""

While some restaurants have reportedly started adding so-called Covid surcharges to bills, US food costs away from home went up just 0.4% from April to May, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Less is more

Shrinking the menu is a better option. It allows restaurants to order ingredients in bulk and achieve better economies of scale. And because restaurants remove their least popular or more expensive items, the changes may impact a relatively small number of customers.

At Dave & Buster's for example, ""the 15 items we selected generate a significant portion of our food revenue,"" CEO Jenkins explained.

Even before the pandemic hit, restaurants would sometimes trim their menus to reduce costs or increase efficiencies. ""We tend to go in and out of those phases,"" said Powell, the food consultant. Last year, McDonald's reduced its late-night menu and abandoned its craft burgers to help speed up its service and make its menus less complex.

And while some customers may miss seeing their favorite dish on the menu, others may be happy with — or at least tolerant of — the changes.

At McDonald's, the newly reduced menu has improved customer satisfaction scores ""significantly,"" said Mark Salebra, chair of the McDonald's National Franchisee Leadership Alliance in a statement provided by a company spokesperson.

Plus, some diners may not care that much about variety right now.

Denny's ""customers have been extremely understanding of the adjustments we've made,"" said Dillon, adding ""we've found our guests are appreciative of the focus we have been putting on safety, cleanliness and sanitation that a slightly smaller menu enables.""

IHOP's Haley put it this way: ""we're not seeing complaints from guests.""",2020-06-23,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/23/business/restaurant-menus-shrinking/index.html
Parija Kavilanz,Got these brands in your closet? You've hit a resale goldmine,"New York (CNN Business) Pandemic-triggered quarantine has many people cleaning out their closets and considering reselling clothes that they no longer need. If you're looking to make some cash on clothing resale platforms, check your closet for brands that have the best resale value.

Reworn clothing is a growing market that is expected to reach $64 billion in sales by 2024 from current sales of $28 billion, according to a new joint annual industry report from ThredUp, the world's largest online thrift and consignment platform, and research and analytics firm GlobalData.

According to the report, 62 million women purchased secondhand in 2019, up from 56 million women in 2018. And just this year alone, the online secondhand marketplace is expected to grow 27%, while the broader retail sector is expected to shrink by 23%, the report showed.

Matt Mcfarland,The Segway is officially over,"Washington, DC (CNN) The Segway PT , which earned a place in pop culture but never realized its creators' world-changing ambitions, will come to an end this summer.

China-based Ninebot, which acquired Segway in 2015, will halt production of the PT, short for Personal Transporter, on July 15. Twenty-one staffers will be laid off at its Bedford, New Hampshire plant. Fast Company first reported the news.

The Segway PT made a splash in December 3, 2001 when it was unveiled on Good Morning America. Inventor Dean Kamen saidthat an urban transportation revolution was coming and cars would be obsolete. Kamen felt it was absurd to use 4,000-pound cars and trucks for short trips.

But last year the Segway PT accounted for only 1.5% of Ninebot's revenue, according to Tony Ho, vice president of global business development at Segway. With a price tag starting at $6,000 and sometimes reaching $10,000, only police departments and tour groups could afford it, he said.

""It was a great invention 20 years ago,"" said Ho. ""Now it seems a bit outdated."" He addedthat some police departments have shifted to Ninebot's cheaper electric scooters. Ninebot is also ending production of a three-wheeled Segway device that was designed for community policing.

Before the Segway, Kamen made a name for himself as an inventor of medical devices such as a portable insulin pump. The Segway PT project grew out of his work in the 1990s on a self-balancing wheelchair.

The Segway PT was ahead of its time, but not just in a good way. The price tag was a major barrier to adoption, coming in at $4,950 when it was first released. Batteries, which initially cost more than $1,000, were too expensive to make a more affordable version. For years, the company struggled to reduce the price. Prices actually increased, likely due to inflation and new off-roading features, according to Ho. Since 2001, 140,000 PTs have been sold, according to a Segway spokesman.

Sarah El Sirgany,Coronavirus death rates in Yemen's Aden could exceed its wartime fatalities,"(CNN) Ghasan Saleh starts digging graves at the break of dawn to prepare for the dead bodies that will come in droves. Two men in white hazmat suits appear atop an approaching pickup truck. They hastily drop a corpse into a hole and cover it with dirt.

The health workers come and go in near-silence. Fear of infection means there are no mourners for those suspected to have died from Covid-19.

The cycle of digging and abrupt funerals continues under the blistering sun and suffocating humidity of Aden , the seat of power of the UN-recognized government in war-torn Yemen.

The Al Radwan cemetery has quickly expanded over the past few months, with new graves creeping closer to the residential buildings that border it. ""You can see my digging machine,"" says Saleh. ""Just now I dug 20 graves.""

Local medical authorities say that death rates in Aden are soaring this year, despite a relative lull in a war that ravaged the place in previous years.

The Al Radwan cemetery in Aden has rapidly expanded after a surge in Covid-related deaths.

In the first half of May, the city recorded 950 deaths -- nearly four times as many as the 251 deaths in the whole month of March, according to a Ministry of Health report.

Those 950 deaths in two weeks in May represent nearly half the number of casualties the city suffered in all of 2015, when the country's civil war was raging.

Back then Aden was devastated by heavy fighting, its streets blasted by rockets and its houses peppered with bullets. Now the city's biggest killers are silent.

On top of Covid-19, there's also a mosquito-transmitted virus outbreak, known as Chikungunya virus , and more than 100,000 known cholera cases across the nation. Many malnutrition centers and hospitals have closed due to funding shortfalls and doctors' concerns about their personal safety from coronavirus. Flash floods this spring destroyed the city's power grid.

""Yemen has faced wars and cannot handle three pandemics, economic collapse and a war and the coronavirus,"" Dr. Ishraq Al-Subei, the health official responsible for the response to the disease told CNN.

The official Covid-19 death toll in southern Yemen stands at only 127. Health workers say they don't know what the actual number is, because of low testing capacity. But the huge surge in deaths in Aden is being seen as a warning of worse to come, as the health sector becomes overwhelmed and more people die of treatable diseases.

In pursuit of a hospital bed

Hmeid Mohammed, 38, had an agonizing journey that started with a mild fever at home.

His family couldn't find a hospital to take him to when his fever started to rise rapidly in early May. He was in a coma when he was admitted by the only hospital in Aden designated to treat Covid-19 at the time.

""They brought him back to life,"" his brother-in-law Anwar Motref recalled.

He was diagnosed with meningitis, another disease common in Yemen. As soon as he showed signs of improvement, doctors advised him to leave the hospital to avoid becoming infected with Covid-19.

About a week later, his health deteriorated. Again, the family went to different hospitals in an effort to have him admitted, but with little success. Eventually they found him a bed in an emergency ward that he shared with six other people. Fluid filled his lungs and his kidneys were failing.

The family had the funds for medical treatment, but Aden's hospitals were either closed or full. A hunt for admission to a hospital that could perform surgery and dialysis in time to save him failed.

Mohammed died in late May, robbing his three children and widow of the family's only bread-winner.

""Who is to blame for all of this? We do not have a government or a state or anyone to help us in this country,"" Motref said at the family home in the rocky hills around Aden.

""Who should we complain to? We are tired of this life. Every morning we wake up to hear of 10-15 people who died,"" he added.

Local health officials say Aden recorded an average of 55 daily deaths in May, a significant surge from previous months.

Disappearing aid and a collapsing health sector

The guns in Aden have become quieter in recent months but Yemen's war has not gone away.

Five years of conflict has beggared the nation. Today more than half its population relies on aid to survive.

But the United Nations is now facing a potentially catastrophic shortfall in funds -- around $1 billion -- for this year. It is warning of a collapsing heath sector and the possibility that Yemen's death toll may continue to rise dramatically -- possibly exceeding the total number of dead during five years of war, when the country endured what was considered the world's ""worst humanitarian crisis.""

Fatalities in Aden, the seat of power of Yemen's internationally-recognized government, are poised to exceed its wartime fatalities.

""We are a billion short of our minimum target,"" Lise Grande, the head of the UN's humanitarian operations in Yemen, told CNN. ""So In the time of Covid what this means is that we're going to see approximately half of the hospitals which we are currently supporting in the country closed down -- and that's going to be happening in just the next few weeks.

""A week before the first Covid-19 case was confirmed in Yemen we ran out of money and had to stop allowances for 10,000 frontline health workers across the country. In the middle of Covid, it's devastating,"" she added.

There are just 60 hospital beds dedicated to Covid-19 in Aden, which has a population of roughly 800,000. These are in two hospitals operated by Doctors Without Borders (MSF). The city has 18 ventilators, all constantly in use, according to MSF.

Doctors and aid workers say patients mostly seek hospital treatment in late stages of the disease, when it is likely too late to save them. And in most cases, there is no capacity to treat them.

""Most cases are rejected because there are no available ventilators,"" Dr. Farouk Abduallah Nagy, head of the isolation department at the Gomhuria Hospital, told CNN.

Anwar Motref helped his brother-in-law Hmeid Mohammed find a hospital bed in his last days. Now, Mohammed's children are in his care.

""The health sector was already weak before the outbreak. And it is getting worse and worse. The health sector is collapsing,"" said Caroline Seguin, MSF communications officer in Aden.

Outside the city, the fighting between southern separatists and the government rages on , compounding the effects of the ongoing five-year war between Houthi rebels in the north and the fractious coalition backed by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in the south.

More than 112,000 people have been killed in airstrikes, shelling and bombing, according to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED).

Hundreds of thousands of people have been driven into camps as refugees from the war. There they face the risks of endemic disease, malnutrition, and overcrowding -- all ideal conditions for the spread of a disease like Covid-19.

Mokhtar Ahmed, originally from the port city of Hodeidah in the north, came to a camp on the outskirts of Aden three years ago.

""Cholera and the wars are one thing and corona is something else,"" he told CNN, flanked by his two children.

Ipek Yezdani,Saudi consulate staff describe strange events on day of Khashoggi's death,"(CNN) Staff who worked at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul around the time of Jamal Khashoggi 's murder told a court Friday that they were told to stay away from the residence on the day the dissident journalist went missing in 2018.

A cleaning lady, two drivers, and a technical worker were all denied access or told not to show up to work on October 2, they said on the first day of the trial at a Turkish court.

Consulate technical worker Zeki Demir said he was initially told that there would be renovations at Consul General Mohammed al-Otaibi's home but was then asked to come in at 2 p.m.

""There were five or six people there. They stopped me from coming through the three entrances. They asked me to light up the tandoor (oven). There was an atmosphere of panic,"" he said.

""I lit up the tandoor and they spoke with each other. I joked saying that if you fall in the tandoor then you will become kebabs. Then I left.""

The Consul General's driver, Hakan Guven told the court that he took al-Otaibi and his family to the airport on October 8. Guven said al-Otaibi told him that he would return.

Their statements were included in the indictment, which lays out in detail the events leading up to the afternoon of October 2, when Khashoggi walked into the Saudi consulate in a busy business district in Istanbul to pick up papers that would have allowed him to marry his fiancée Hatice Cengiz. He never emerged.

Lawyers for the 20 Saudi defendants, assigned by Turkey's Bar Association for a fair trial, said they were unable to reach their clients.

The suspects named in the indictment include Ahmed al-Assiri, a former deputy head of Saudi Arabia's general intelligence, and Saud al-Qahtani, a former adviser to the Saudi Crown Prince. Both men are accused of ""instigating premeditated torturous murder with monstrous intent."" The remaining 18 defendants are being charged with ""premeditated torturous murder with monstrous intent.""

Cengiz, United Nations special rapporteur Agnes Callamard, representatives of International press Institute (IPI), European Federation of Journalist (EFJ) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) were all present at the trial on Friday.

Cengiz, who is hoping the case will offer new clues to the whereabouts of Khashoggi's remains, told journalists outside the court that the whole process was ""exhausting both spiritually and psychologically"" for her.

""It is a moral responsibility on our shoulders to pursue this murder,"" she said.

Hatice Cengiz hopes the case will offer new clues to the whereabouts of Jamal Khashoggi's remains.

She added that they will continue to seek justice both in Turkey and anywhere in the world.

Callamard, the UN special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary killings, said: ""We are sending a very strong message to dictators around the world that they cannot get away with killing a journalist.""

Saudi Arabia held a trial in December and found eight people guilty of charges relating to Khashoggi's death, but the proceedings were opaque and the defendants' identities were not revealed. Callamard said that hearing from the witnesses in this formal space would give ""far more legitimacy and strength to their statement.""

""We're moving into a space of justice. The Saudi process was anything but justice, it was a travesty of justice in my opinion and it was closed, secret trial. Here we have a space where the victims are heard in a way that they have never been heard before,"" she told media outside the court.

""It is important for truth telling because more information is coming up and more information will come up,"" she added.

Despite her findings that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman knew about the murder, he was not mentioned by name at the hearing, Callamard added.

""He was mentioned in a tangential fashion,"" she said.

She said she was unsure whether this was because of his diplomatic immunity or whether it was because the prosecution did not have enough evidence.

Ankara has repeatedly called for the suspects to be extradited and tried in Turkey where the crime took place. Riyadh has not complied with the request.

The Turkish indictment outlines a conspiracy among the defendants. It includes CCTV footage of the movement of the suspects — 15 of whom flew into Turkey from Saudi Arabia ahead of the killing — as well as eyewitness testimony from Turkish workers in the consulate who were given time off on the day of the murder.

The trial has brought fresh hope for Cengiz, who says she will not stop pursuing justice for her slain fiancée.

""I will continue to pursue all legal avenues to hold Jamal's killers accountable and I will not rest until we get Justice for Jamal,"" she said in a written statement to CNN. ""Jamal's killers and those who ordered his murder have evaded justice thus far. I hope this criminal case in Turkey brings to light the whereabouts of Jamal's body, the evidence against the killers and the evidence of those behind the gruesome murder.""

The Saudi government has presented shifting stories about Khashoggi's fate in the months following his death. Initially Saudi officials denied any knowledge of the journalist's whereabouts, then shifted to arguing that a group of rogue operators carried out the murder without the involvement of Bin Salman . Turkish officials have said Riyadh has not been cooperative in their investigation.

US officials, however, have said such a mission -- including the 15-man hit squad sent from Riyadh -- could not have been carried out without the authorization of Bin Salman, and the CIA concluded that the Crown Prince had ordered the killing. Saudi authorities have vehemently denied the allegations.

In December 2019, 11 unnamed suspects were put on trial in Saudi Arabi. Eight people were found guilty of charges related to Khashoggi's death, five of whom were sentenced to death. They were later pardoned by one of Khashoggi's sons, sparing them from the death penalty in accordance with Saudi legal custom.

Al-Qahtani and al-Assiri were cleared by Saudi authorities. Both men, part of the Crown Prince's inner circle , were relieved of their duties in the immediate aftermath of Khashoggi's killing.

In a report last year, Callamard concluded that Saudi Arabia was responsible under international law for the ""deliberate, premeditated execution"" of Khashoggi, and called for an investigation into the role of the Crown Prince, saying there was ""credible evidence meriting further investigation.""

Analysis Jomana Karadsheh,Why West Bank annexation poses an existential threat to Jordan,"(CNN) On what was once a desert minefield separating Jordan from Israel , King Hussein and Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin made history. It was October 1994 and the Jordanian and Israeli leaders were signing a peace deal, turning the page on decades of war and hostility.

The iconic moment was in no small part the result of a shared vision for peace by two men who were said to have a personal chemistry between them. It was a day ""like no other,"" an emotional King Hussein announced. It was ""the dawning of the new era of peace... As we come together to ensure, God willing, that there will be no more death, no more misery, no more suspicion, no more fear, no more uncertainty.""

But 26 years on, that vision looks like an illusion. The survival of the peace treaty -- one of two Israel has with the Arab world -- is now in question.

""We are at ... the lowest level in the relationship ... since the signing of the peace treaty"" Jordan's Prime Minister Omar Razzaz told CNN in March. At the time, it seemed as though the relationship could be salvaged, that Israel and the Trump administration could be dissuaded from making good on promises to annex parts of the West Bank.

Now, while the immediate timetable for annexation might be slipping a bit, Israel still appears to be on the verge of unilaterally proclaiming sovereignty on a patch of land that is a critical part of Jordan's foreign and domestic policy. This has driven the Jordanian sovereign, King Abdullah, into a corner.

The Jordanians share the view of much of the international community when it comes to this issue: annexation of the West Bank, they say, would kill the long-touted two state solution. It would undermine a 2002 Arab peace initiative that outlines a future Palestinian state based on Israel's pre-1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital. The Jordanian monarch has also long believed that there will be no end to the region's turmoil without a resolution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, something that appears to be an ever-dimmer prospect after US President Donald Trump's peace plan failed to bring the Palestinians back to the negotiating table.

But for Jordan, this is not just about peace in the region. The end of the two-state solution would present an existential threat to the Kingdom, rattling its identity and future.

US President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump welcome Jordan's Queen Rania and King Abdullah II outside the West Wing of the White House in April 2017.

A deteriorating relationship with Netanyahu

The relationship between Israel and Jordan has grown more strained with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the helm. Jordanian officials have always been wary of him and his right-wing politics. But a Netanyahu emboldened by Trump's backing has become nearly impossible for Jordanian officials to work with.

According to a Palestinian media report citing a Jordanian official in June, the King didn't take a call from the Israeli PM. Jordanian officials would not confirm or deny the report that was widely circulated in Israeli media.

The Israeli Prime Minister's office said the report is not true.

""The message should be clear: annexation will not go unanswered. For if it does, there will only be a fiercer conflict. Annexation will make the two-state solution an impossibility,"" Jordan's Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi warned at a committee meeting in early June.

The two countries still maintain close ties when it comes to security and intelligence sharing. Historically, Jordan -- while small and resource-poor -- has always been important for Israel. In a hostile neighborhood, Jordan provided Israel with a buffer on its eastern frontier and served as a mediator when Israel needed one.

But now Jordan has its own interests at stake. More than half of Jordan's population of 10 million is of Palestinian descent, and the country is home to more than 2 million registered Palestinian refugees. From a Jordanian perspective, a future Palestinian state would ensure that these refugees would have a right of return and prevents any possibility of a further influx of people. Without that state, Jordan could turn into a de facto state for the Palestinians -- something Jordanians fear is in fact the ultimate aim of right-wing Israelis.

If Netanyahu goes ahead with the plan on or after July 1, the immediate concern for the Jordanians will be quelling anger on their streets, potentially putting King Abdullah in one of the toughest positions of his two-decade rule.

The peace treaty between the two countries never got popular support. Calls have been growing among lawmakers and the public for the Kingdom to abolish the peace treaty and sever ties with Israel.

In May, the monarch told the German publication Der Spiegel that if annexation went ahead it would lead to ""a massive conflict with ... Jordan."" While not going as far as threatening to abrogate the peace treaty, he said all options were being considered. It was his most stark warning to the Israelis yet.

It is not clear what that ""conflict"" would entail but unrest in the Middle East is always an opportunity for extremism to flourish. Additionally, an annexation -- whether partial or total -- vindicates anyone in Jordan who opposed peace with Israel, and gives those who advocated against trusting Israel an opportunity to turn around and say. ""I told you so.""

Trump and Netanyahu take part in an announcement of Trump's Middle East peace plan in the White House on January 28, 2020.

The king's options are limited. His country is heavily reliant on US aid and with a US president who has frequently used aid as leverage and threatened to withhold it from allies, Abdullah would have to tread carefully. Risking US aid would be dangerous for the country, especially with growing public discontent over the state of the economy.

Standing alongside King Abdullah in the White House's Rose Garden in 2017, President Trump showered his key ally with praise and promised to consult with the monarch on an Israeli-Palestinian peace plan. But in the months and years that followed, Abdullah was sidelined and his advice was ignored. Jordanian officials say they only saw the peace plan when it was unveiled in January.

These shifting relationships appear to have prompted the Jordanian monarchy to circumvent the White House in their bid to prevent annexation and appeal directly to Republican and Democratic US lawmakers. The king held several video calls with congressional leaders, including Nancy Pelosi and Mitch McConnell in mid-June.

Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi has been engaged in a diplomacy marathon, trying to garner international backing for Jordan's campaign to stop the annexation. In mid-June, he paid a rare visit to Ramallah, the seat of the Palestinian Authority's power, in a show of support to Palestinians. He also held a series of calls with his Arab and Western counterparts, including the German, Austrian, Egyptian, Irish and Finnish foreign ministers, asking them to work to stop the annexation.

Jordan's efforts may do little to stave off the Israeli plan, but pressure from another influential Arab state may be having more of an impact on Israeli decision making.

In an unusual move, the United Arab Emirates Ambassador to the US, Yousef Al Otaiba in a Hebrew-language article published in an Israeli daily, called the annexation move ""an illegal seizure."" He gave Israelis an ultimatum: it is either annexation or normalization.

The UAE and other Arab Gulf states have been moving closer towards normalizing ties with Israel. A strategic relationship Israel has been pursuing for years.

""Annexation will certainly and immediately upend Israeli aspirations for improved security, economic and cultural ties with the Arab world and with UAE. With the region's two most capable militaries, common concerns about terrorism and aggression, and a deep and long relationship with the United States, the UAE and Israel could form closer and more effective security cooperation"" Al Otaiba wrote.

The influential diplomat also singled out Jordan and his country's concerns about the impact annexation will have on the Kingdom. Abu Dhabi's Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Zayed reiterated his country's support for Jordan's bid in a tweet last week.

""(The annexation) will send shock waves around the region, especially in Jordan whose stability -- often taken for granted -- benefits the entire region, particularly Israel,"" Al Otaiba warned.",2020-07-01,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/01/middleeast/jordan-west-bank-annexation-israel-intl/index.html
Tamara Qiblawi,"As the US rolls out new sanctions on Assad, Syria braces for economic devastation","Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) The United States has rolled out fresh sanctions that aim to drive Syrian President Bashar al-Assad back to a UN-led negotiating table and threaten to devastate Syria's already floundering economy.

On Wednesday the US State Department and Treasury Department released 39 targets for sanctions, including Assad and his wife Asma al-Assad, marking ""the beginning of what will be a sustained campaign of economic and political pressure to deny the Assad regime revenue and support it uses to wage war and commit mass atrocities against the Syrian people,"" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement.

""We anticipate many more sanctions and we will not stop until Assad and his regime stop their needless, brutal war against the Syrian people and the Syrian government agrees to a political solution to the conflict as called for by UNSCR 2254,"" he said, referring to a UN Security Council Resolution calling for a ceasefire and political settlement in Syria.

The first tranche of economic penalties come as part of the newly enforced Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act, which is expected to trigger the most wide-reaching and aggressive economic penalties ever imposed on Syria, potentially targeting its energy, construction and banking sector.

The bill was named after a former photographer for the Syrian military, codenamed Caesar, who leaked a trove of photographs showing dead and mutilated prisoners in Assad's jails.

""Caesar,"" the man credited with smuggling out 50,000 photos said to document Syrian government atrocities, listens to his interpreter as he prepares to speak at a US Congressional briefing in July 2014.

US Ambassador to the United Nations Kelly Craft told the Security Council on Tuesday the move was a bid to ""prevent the Assad regime from securing a military victory, and to steer the regime and its allies back toward Special Envoy (Geir) Pedersen and the UN-led political process.""

Syria angrily hit back at the sanctions on Wednesday, saying the US move ""exceeds the ugliest forms of lies and hypocrisy.""

In a statement to state-run news agency SANA, Syria's Foreign and Expatriates Ministry also questioned US moral authority, in the light of recent widespread protests over the deaths of several black Americans in police custody. The US, it said, ""is the last one who has the right to talk about the human rights, because the US administrations have established their state upon the culture of killing, disregarding any value of laws or conventions,"" it said.

China and Russia also criticized the plan on Tuesday. China's UN Ambassador Zhang Jun called the sanctions ""inhumane."" Russia's UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia accused Washington of attempting to ""overthrow the legitimate authorities of Syria,"" according to Reuters

The Caesar Act, a bipartisan Congress bill, has received broad support from Syria's diaspora community, many of whom were driven into exile by Assad's brutal oppression of largely peaceful protests that began in 2011. Assad has been repeatedly accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity in his military campaign to quash Syria's armed opposition. He is also widely believed to have been behind multiple chemical attacks in rebel-held areas. Assad's government has repeatedly denied the charges.

But even among Syria's opposition, many expect that the US sanctions will also deal a crushing blow to Syria's civilian population. The poverty rate stands at over 80%, according to the UN . Syria's currency collapsed rapidly in recent months on the heels of an economic crisis in neighboring Lebanon, where many Syrian businessmen circumvented international sanctions during the war. Much of Syria lies in ruin.

""(Syria's) economy has become something similar to the economy of the West Bank, an economy reliant on aid,"" Syria analyst and nonresident scholar at the DC-based Middle East Institute Karam Shaar told CNN. ""It's not really a functional economy. It's basically something that survives only because the West keeps injecting money into it.""

US sanctions threaten to cut off injections of cash from donations and remittances that keep the country afloat. Because the Caesar Act includes secondary sanctions -- punishing non-US people and entities for transactions with regime-held Syria -- they will likely create ""phobia"" and ""panic from banks"" around dealing with Syria, said Shaar, choking off financial transactions to the country.

He also warned that humanitarian exemptions for food and medicines included in the Caesar Act may have no effect, a situation that would be similar to Iran, which has also struggled to obtain medicinal supplies despite US waivers.

""When you have an act that destroys the exchange rate of a country -- and you know that 60% of the inputs for the pharmaceutical industry are actually imported -- you are affecting medicines,"" said Shaar. ""The Caesar Act will affect everything.""

""Unless the Syrian regime accepts to negotiate, I project a famine and it's going to be terrible.""

The sanctions' knock-on effects in neighboring Lebanon are also expected to further cripple its collapsing economy. Lebanon's banking sector, which is buckling under a severe liquidity crisis, is believed to possess billions of dollars of Syrian assets. Because of this, the international financial system may soon deem Lebanon's banks untouchable, said Shaar.

Tensions in Lebanon have reached fever pitch in recent weeks, as its currency continued to tank, stoking riots across the country. On Tuesday night, the leader of the Iran-backed militant and political group Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, delivered a fiery televized address vowing to prop up Syria economically and calling on Lebanon to spurn US pressure to abide by the Caesar Act.

Nasrallah also accused the Trump administration of ""laying siege"" to Lebanon's economy in an effort to pressure Hezbollah, and suggested that the country could move deeper into the economic orbit of Iran, Syria and China, doing away with US influence.

Lebanon's political establishment is composed of a hodge-podge of pro-US and pro-Iran politicians. Hezbollah, which intervened in the Syrian war on Assad's behalf, is the most powerful political force in Lebanon.

The US has repeatedly said that it supports reforming Lebanon's deeply sectarian political leadership and combating corruption, and has not yet publicly pre-conditioned economic support for Lebanon on Hezbollah's disarmament. But local media and politicians have speculated that the international community has shunned the country as part of a ramped up international effort to dislodge the armed group.

""(Lebanon's government must) demonstrate that they're willing to take tough decisions to reform,"" said Assistant Secretary for Near Eastern Affairs David Schenker at a talk at the Middle East Institute earlier this month. ""It's hard to see how (Hezbollah) are going to get behind this reform.""

As Assad and his allies double down on anti-US stances, there are few signs the Syrian government intends to return to the negotiating table, and analysts warn that the Caesar Act will do little to hold Assad accountable for his crimes.

""Caesar's proponents hope that the law will prove a step towards accountability for the regime's terrible crimes,"" Syria Program Director at Synaps Group Alex Simon told CNN. ""While that goal is unassailable, there's no evidence to suggest that Caesar would achieve this.""

Simon describes the sanctions as a ""policy of piecemeal, reflexive escalation, for which ordinary Syrians pay the price.""

""People today are selling off what few assets they still have in order to feed their families. Some are selling kidneys,"" said Simon. ""Pharmaceutical shortages are so bad that people have taken to Facebook to pool information on who has spare medicine that may help save lives.""",2020-06-17,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/17/middleeast/syria-caesar-act-us-sanctions-economy-intl/index.html
Lisa Respers France,What August Alsina said after Jada Pinkett Smith and Will Smith's 'Red Table Talk',"(CNN) People are fascinated by August Alsina's ""entanglement"" with Jada Pinkett Smith, but the singer seems less than thrilled with all the attention.

Pinkett Smith and her husband of 23 years, actor Will Smith, confirmed during Friday's episode of her Facebook talk show ""Red Table Talk"" that she had been romantically involved with Alsina years ago.

The superstar couple said the relationship began during a period they had separated.

""I got into an entanglement with August,"" Pinkett Smith said during the talk.

In a recent interview with radio host Angela Yee, Alsina said he had been involved romantically with Pinkett Smith. Pinkett Smith has been married to Smith since 1997 and shares two children with him.

""I actually sat down with Will and had a conversation,"" Alsina said during his interview with Yee. ""Due to the transformation from their marriage to (a) life partnership that they have spoken on several times, and not involving romanticism, he gave me his blessing.""

Pinkett Smith said during her ""Red Table Talk"" that she began a friendship with Alsina four and a half years ago which developed into something more after she and Smith hit a rough patch in their relationship and agreed to amicably split.

But she denied that her husband had given Alsina permission to be involved with her, though she added that she understood why the young singer may have believed that to be the case.

""The only person that can give permission in that particular circumstance is myself,"" she said. ""I could actually see how he would perceive it as permission because we were separated amicably and I think he also wanted to make it clear that he's also not a homewrecker. Which he's not.""

She said the relationship ended, she and Smith reconciled and they are now at a place of ""unconditional love.""

The whole drama set social media afire and soon there were plenty of memes and conversation about the ""entanglement.""

On Friday Alsina responded on Twitter after actress Keke Palmer tweeted to set the record straight about whether they had been romantically involved.

Palmer denied they were when a follower shared a picture of Palmer and Alsina together and inquired about it.

After sharing his thoughts about that (and confirming that he and Palmer had not been a couple), Alsina tweeted what some took to be his frustration resulting from all the attention and hoopla.

Imagine not knowing how to mind the business that pay you. I catch all the subliminals. (Not just about today)

& you can call me whatever you like, Mess is constantly inserting yourself in topics you have nun to do w/.

He went on to add ""If you have something to say, say it w/ ya CHEST kids.""

If you have something to say, say it w/ ya CHEST kids.

It's always very perplexing cause I real deal be showing people genuine love. Whole time that envy eating ya lil heart.

Anyway, NEXT!! — August Alsina (@AugustAlsina) July 10, 2020

""It's always very perplexing cause I real deal be showing people genuine love,"" he tweeted. ""Whole time that envy eating ya lil heart. Anyway, NEXT!!""

Alsina has not shied away from the drama.

A week before Pinkett Smith and her husband broke their silence, Alsina appeared to double down on his claim about the relationship in a lengthy Instagram post in which he wrote about a variety of topics.

In part he wrote ""A tower of truth can never fall, only a tower of lies can do that.""

""My truth is MY truth, & its mine to own,"" he wrote. ""There is no right or wrong here, it simply just IS. & I make room and have acceptance for your thoughts and opinions, regardless if I agree or not, you have that freedom to feel WHATEVER it is u feel because when you're at TRUE peace, all of the noise and chatter becomes that of a whisper.""

Jacob Krol,The best TVs of 2020,"We have more screens in our lives than ever before, from the smartphone in our pocket to the laptop for work. And yet, a TV that provides a communal, cinematic viewing experience is still an important part of the home for most people. What’s exciting is that TV technology has evolved rapidly in recent years — and the size, tech and quality that was once financially out of reach for many of us is now available for just a few hundred dollars.

If you choose wisely, that investment should last you a while. You don’t need to replace a TV that’s just a couple of years old, as breakthroughs happen a lot more slowly for televisions than they do for other tech, like smart speakers, earbuds or mobile phones.

To help steer you to the best choices, we spent the past few months testing the latest available model (either 2019 or 2020) of a range of TVs, from 43 to 75 inches. After many hours bingeing our favorite shows and movies in the name of research, comparing aspect ratios and display quality, and testing the smarts of each model, we found that these three TVs rose to the top:

A quick look at the winners

With models starting at $599.99 for a 55-inch, the TCL 6-Series might give you reverse sticker shock considering everything you get for that relatively small price tag. But can a 4K smart TV with so many specification standards really deliver a good picture for $500? The short answer: a resounding yes. The TCL 6-Series produces a vibrant picture with flexible customization options and handles both HDR and Dolby Vision, optimization standards that improve the content you’re watching by adding depth to details and expanding the color spectrum.

For those willing and able to spend top dollar, the Sony A8H, a 2020 OLED TV, delivers a vibrant and strong picture with deep blacks and a sleek build. Though it starts at $1,898 for a 55-inch model (the 65-inch is $2,798), you’re getting an OLED, which means the panel is made up of pixels that individually emit a color to create a sharper image. The Sony A8H boasts a broad range of colors, from glowing brights to subtle pastels, and pitch-dark blacks. It supports an array of picture standards that automatically upscale and improve the quality of content, and the result is an exceptionally vibrant and detailed picture.

With so many sub-$500 options, the budget category was crammed with competition. Ultimately, the $379.99 (on sale for $339.99) Vizio V-Series 55-inch TV performed best in our testing. The device is 4K HDR-capable and supports easy ways to send content from your phone to the big screen (Google Cast and AirPlay 2). It’s also equipped with Dolby Vision, which will automatically increase the colors and contrast of eligible content. It beats out all lower-end TCL models and Fire TV Editions and delivers a very solid image at this price point.

Best overall TV: TCL 6-Series (starting at $579.99; amazon.com)

One of the best things about the TCL 6-Series is that it’s a Roku TV, so you get access to thousands of streaming services out of the box. You don’t need a treasure map to find the content, either. The main interface is a simple three-box-wide grid and a list on the side that acts as a quick settings menu. Your inputs (like HDMIs and antennas) appear as boxes on the grid, beside the boxes for the streaming services and apps you choose to add, allowing for quick switching. The interface can get clunky as your list of services and apps grows, but you can organize and arrange them — as a grid or list — however you like, to make it easier to find what you’re looking for.

The TCL 6-Series’ Roku interface enables both browsing and searching for services from the left nav. Netflix, Disney+, YouTube, Hulu, Apple TV+, Sling, AT&T TV, YouTube TV, Philo, Google Play, ESPN and most other streaming services are available. You’ll need an account for full access to them, but once you’re set up, you just log in once from the TV (authenticate using a computer or phone, if asked) and you’re in. As more channels and services are released for Roku, your TV will be automatically updated.

Casting content to the 6-Series from your phone is also simple, and you can do so with several services, including Netflix, Hulu and YouTube. As long as you’re on the same Wi-Fi network, the 6-Series will automatically show up within the cast menu for the app.

And you don’t have to worry about all that content going to waste on a subpar screen. The TCL 6-Series’$2 4K UHD panel handles color reproduction quite well. During “Avengers: Endgame,” we were impressed with the vibrant and accurate colors of Captain America’s red, white and blue shield — not to mention that rugged green we know and love from The Hulk. Nothing was washed out or appeared dingy or oversaturated to a cartoonish degree.

The TV also supports Dolby Vision HDR, HDR 10, CCZ Technology and a wide color gamut. This means that the TV can read embedded metadata to calibrate the picture in real-time so it appears closer to the creator’s intentions. Overall, it delivers accuracy in color reproduction and contrast, and displays a mastery of both brights and darks.

When we watched “Springsteen on Broadway” streamed over Netflix in Dolby Vision, the detail presented — from the pores on Bruce’s face to the wood texture on his guitar — was second to none. Even dimly lit props in the background were easy to distinguish. The lighting during “The Rising,” which depicts Springsteen in a bold silhouette, was a real test of how this LED panel handles deep blacks next to a brighter pop of light. When Springsteen was dimly lit from behind against a black background, the TCL was able to contrast the darker areas with crisp highlights, all without any details getting washed out.

Audio quality on the 6-Series is a little underwhelming; we found it too easy, for instance, for the mix to get muddied, with vocals meshing together alongside background ambiance. We definitely recommend pairing the 6-Series with a soundbar or home theater system. That said, it’s true across the board that as TVs have slimmed down, so has the built-in sound quality, and we’d recommend adding external speakers to any of the TVs on this list.

For the price, the TCL 6-Series is a highly capable 4K UHD TV that has the chops to deliver meaningful HDR content improvements — including increased brightness and additional emphasis on colors. It’s a massive 65-inch panel big enough to fill most spaces for well under $800. Plus, we can’t praise the Roku TV platform enough. We’re confident recommending the TCL 6-Series as a tremendous value and the best option for most people.

The luxury pick: Sony A8H (starting at $1,898; amazon.com)

PHOTO: Jacob Krol/CNN

Buying an OLED means you’re paying for a premium picture quality that delivers breathtaking vibrant colors and deep blacks, and that’s certainly what you get with the Sony A8H, which narrowly out-performed LG’s CX 55 and provides more value than Samsung’s 8K QLED Q800T.

This panel produces hyper-accurate colors in immense detail, in part thanks to Sony’s flagship X1 Ultimate processor. This technology optimizes whatever you’re watching in real-time, upscales content to 4K ultra high-definition, and allows you to take advantage of standards like HDR or Dolby Vision. It’s the same basic metadata reproduction that TCL features on the 6-Series, but Sony has a leg up since many of the cameras and displays on TV and film sets are made by them. Thanks to this, they have a large backlog of content that they’ve run AI through to determine the best way to calibrate a TV for a dog, or a fiery explosion or even a cityscape. The A8H taps into this knowledge and uses the processor to calibrate the panel and optimize the image. All that to say: Sony is really superior when it comes to producing the best image on a TV.

This shone through during our testing. With an episode from the first season of “The Simpsons,” compared to some of the other TVs we tested, there was noticeably less fuzziness around the characters, and the picture maintained a realistic balance in vibrance and color.

With both animation and live action, the A8H optimizes in real-time for a highly accurate experience. Take “Captain Marvel,” when (spoiler alert) she ends up defeating the villain by breaking free with a burst of solar energy. The A8H didn’t produce added noise to the graphics — the solar burst didn’t look unnatural and ultimately fit in with the universe around it. Yes, the animation came with high vibrancy, but not so much that it washed out the rest of the frame. This is a trait of the OLED panel, which can make minute changes on a pixel-by-pixel basis, and Sony’s technology optimizes it well on the A8H.

Working on top of this is Dolby Vision, for content that supports it. Essentially, instructions are embedded in the visuals for the best way the A8H can present the content. Similarly to HDR, Dolby Vision will highlight colors and deliver stronger contrast. With content that doesn’t support Dolby Vision, we found ourselves using the Vivid picture mode, which provides the highest amount of brightness. Most importantly, it doesn’t reduce sharpness or add graininess. That’s a big positive.

Sony opted for a custom version of Android TV for the A8H interface. This offers access to a ton of streaming services, including Netflix, Disney+, Hulu and YouTube, although Android TV is more limited than Roku’s platform. Of course you can always expand that library by adding a streaming box, like a Roku Ultra or Apple TV 4K.

The Android TV platform also means you can control the A8H with Google Assistant and ask for content or adjust a setting with voice commands. Simply hold the button on the remote and tell it to open Netflix, or get more specific and request your favorite YouTube channel.

For those in the Apple ecosystem, the A8H supports AirPlay 2 for casting content from your iOS, iPadOS, macOS or watchOS device. It also works with Amazon Alexa, but the controls are limited to basic commands like turning the TV on and off and controlling playback. It’s nice to have, but since this is Android TV, the deepest integration by far is with Google Assistant.

On the sound front, there isn’t space for the usual speakers at the bottom of the TV —- facing forward or downward —- like on LED or QLED TVs. On the A8H, the sound comes from the screen, through two actuators that vibrate to create it. It’s rather impressive and delivers an immersive experience, though we still recommend a soundbar or home theater setup.

The A8H packs all that tech into a really slim package — almost to a jaw-dropping degree, especially if you’ve never seen an OLED TV. At its thinnest point the A8H is just a quarter of an inch thick, while most TVs span at least two inches thick.

All in all, an OLED delivers what might just be the best picture on the market. You get incredibly deep blacks (if you’re looking at the depths of the ocean, you feel as if you might get sucked in) and vibrant colors that will have you tasting rainbows. Sony’s A8H achieves all of this and pairs it with cinematic colors and blacks. You’re paying nearly $2,000 (or $3,000, depending on the size), but you’re getting a first-rate TV that you won’t have to think about upgrading for many years to come.

Best budget buy: Vizio V-Series (starting at $339.99; target.com)

PHOTO: Jacob Krol/CNN

While opting to pay less for a TV always comes with compromises (namely in picture quality compared with our other top picks), the 55-inch Vizio V-Series leaves relatively little to be desired at this price point. It doesn’t have the best HDR in the business, nor does it deliver the highest level of detail. But considering it starts at just $379.99 (on sale for $339.99), it’s a solid TV with an adequate interface that’s enjoyable to watch.

The V-Series manages to produce a reasonably good display. Take that climactic scene from “Captain Marvel” we discussed above: The contrast between the brilliant solar burst and the darker background is quite nice on the V-Series, though the burst itself isn’t as vibrant when compared with the TCL 6-Series, or as detailed as on the A8H. Similarly, in “Avengers: Endgame,” when Thanos stands alone against the darkness of space, his outfit and skin are presented with considerable vibrancy on the V-Series, but the contrast, color and highlights on his shining armor aren’t depicted quite as accurately as they are on the higher-end models.

With shows delivered at 720p or 1080p HD quality, like “Below Deck Mediterranean” and “90 Day Fiance,” the V-Series panel didn’t introduce extra noise or fuzziness when scaling up the content to higher quality.

Overall, it’s a nice picture, but it just doesn’t create the same immersive experience as the higher-end TVs do.

Vizio’s SmartCast platform is neither our most loved nor our most hated interface. It features access to a ton of services and it plays nice with Alexa, Google and even Apple, similar to Sony’s A8H. It can be slow during the initial setup and during navigation, but it gets the job done when you need to open Netflix or Hulu and start a stream.

The Vizio V-Series delivers acceptable quality, with surprisingly deep blacks and vibrant colors, and gives you access to an otherwise premium ecosystem at a remarkable value for a sub-$400 55-inch 4K TV.

How we tested

After combing through reviews, shopping around and tapping into our own expertise, we tested 10 TVs. And though they vary in size and capabilities, we endeavored to create testing categories that would make for a fair comparison.

We were careful to call out the core technology in the TVs we tested and to note how (or whether) it seemed to impact the viewing experience. Our testing pool consisted of a mix of OLEDs, QLEDs and LED panels. QLEDs and LED panels are similar in that they both use a backlit panel that transmits light through filters containing pixels to create an image. An OLED is entirely different as it emits the image through individual pixels.

We scored each TV on picture and sound quality, with a major emphasis on the former. We also scored them on the smart interface, setup process, design, connectivity, remote and warranty.

We ran the TVs through the setup process and tested all the features and options, such as picture modes, availability of specific services (like casting support) and how easy it was to navigate the interface.

When it comes to TVs, the differences in sound and picture can be subtle. Our extensive testing included watching the same programs across the devices to create an apples-to-apples comparison for noting those small differences.

We looked at the nuances of each remote, feeling for ergonomics and rating the design; a cluttered, clunky remote didn’t do as well as a thin, organized one.

Read on for our testing categories.

Setup

Packaging: We unboxed the TV, fully removing it and its components from any packaging. We took note of how easily and quickly we could strip away styrofoam, cardboard and plastic. Most importantly, we looked at how easy it was to get the TV out of the box.

Setup and instructions: As we set up the TV, we jotted down any grievances we had with the process. This included assembling any hardware, like the TV stand, to setting up software, such as Samsung Tizen or Roku TV. Instructions that required fewer steps, or were easy to visually interpret, scored better.

Design and appeal

Material design: We researched and inspected the materials from which the TV was constructed. We preferred a balance between lighter materials, which made setup easier, and quality plastics and metals.

Bezels: We measured the ratio between bezels, or the frame around the display, and the display itself. A display that occupies a greater portion of the front of the TV was naturally preferred.

Access to ports and buttons: We checked out how easy it was to plug in cables and access ports once the TV was set up. We also noted where buttons were located and how easily we could access them. (Buttons requiring yoga poses to reach them were scored poorly.)

Ports and connectivity

Overall: We tested every port, wireless function and remote connection for functionality and latency. We also noted if HDMI ports were ARC, eARC or 2.1 enabled.

Picture quality

Brightness: We compared the visual brightness each TV could achieve. During programs like “Springsteen on Broadway,” we paid close attention to bright highlights and glossy objects, like the sheen on Springsteen’s guitar.

Contrast: We observed the edges between various objects and people during programs on each TV and looked at these edges in both dark and bright lighting conditions. Edges that were crisp and visually distinct were preferred.

Vibrancy: We compared the color intensity of each TV. During various programs, we noted colorful lights and surfaces in order to contrast these hues between the TVs.

Standards Support (Dolby Vision/HDR/CG): We noted whether each of these standards was available on each TV, and compared the quality of each mode between TVs.

Overall: For the overall picture quality, we put each TV through an abundance of content, including “Hamilton,” “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,” “Frozen II,” “Tangled,” “Wreck-It Ralph,” “Space Force,” “The Bold Type,” “Below Deck,” “90 Day Fiance,” CNN, CNN International, “The Love Guru,” Austin Powers, James Bond and Iron Man movies, “Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice,” “Western Stars,” “Springsteen on Broadway” and countless others.

Sound quality

Note: The built-in speakers on most TVs in 2020 are generally lackluster. If high-quality audio is important to you, given the many relatively affordable options now available, we recommend adding an external sound bar or home theater setup to any of the TVs we tested.

Soundstage: We noted the extent to which each TV could produce a sense of 3D sound. For example, if an instrument is on the far edge of a stage during a performance, a TV with good soundstage will authentically reproduce the position of the sound.

Low: We listened for the clarity and depth of sounds on the lower range, such as bass, drums, deeper instrumentals and vocals. We took note of any artifacts, such as crackling or buzzing, that can accompany such sounds.

Mid: We listened for the clarity of sounds on the medium range, such as vocals, mid-range guitar and environmental noise.

High: We listened for the clarity and pitch of sounds on the higher range, such as high-pitched guitar, vocals and stringed instruments. We noted any common artifacts such as poor volume balancing or screeching when notes get too high.

Smart interface

Ease of use: We checked out how easy it was to navigate to menus. Examples include how many actions it took to get from A to B, how visually available important menus were, how easily we could type in text, and how quickly we could return to a home menu.

Services available: We compared how many services, from streaming services like Disney+ and Netflix to music players like Spotify and Pandora, were available on each TV.

Casting support: We determined whether casting, or mirroring activity from a mobile device or mobile app onto the TV screen, was available.

Remote

Ergonomics: We felt how easily the TV’s remote fit in our hand, and whether it easily slipped out. Remotes generally easier to hold performed better.

Design: We took a look at the topographical organization of buttons and shortcuts (e.g., a button that specifically opens Hulu). We preferred remotes that were organized and didn’t stuff too many nonessential functions into a small space.

Warranty

Warranty: We researched the duration of coverage of the TV’s warranty/warranties.

How we rated

We gave every TV a score in each subcategory described above and combined them to get a score for the category. We weighed picture quality most heavily, with the smart interface and design factors at the second and third levels of importance.

Below is our exact point composition.

Picture quality had a maximum of 50 points: overall (10 points), brightness (10 points), contrast (10 points), vibrancy (10 points) and standards support (10 points).

Smart interface had a maximum of 30 points: ease of use (10 points), available services (10 points) and casting support (10 points).

Design and appeal had a maximum of 25 points: material design (10 points), bezels (10 points) and access to ports and buttons (5 points).

Sound quality had a maximum of 20 points: soundstage (5 points), low (5 points), mid (5 points) and high (5 points).

Setup had a maximum of 15 points: setup and instructions (10 points) and packaging (5 points).

Ports and connectivity had a maximum of 10 points: overall (10 points).

Remote had a maximum of 15 points: design (10 points) and ergonomics (5 points).

Warranty had a maximum of 10 points: warranty (10 points).

Others we tested

43-inch Toshiba Fire TV Edition ($209.99, originally $279.99; bestbuy.com)

At $279.99, the 43-inch Toshiba Fire TV Edition is super affordable. But the picture on its 1080p HD panel left us wanting a bit more. It couldn’t achieve the same clarity or vibrancy as the V-Series or TCL 6-Series. The Fire TV ecosystem gives you access to a ton of services and Alexa control is super easy, but as budget TVs go, the V-Series from Vizio is the better choice.

65-inch Vizio-M Series Quantum ($649.99, originally $749.99; bestbuy.com)

At a similar price point to the TCL 6-Series, Vizio’s M-Series fell in the middle of the pack for our testing. It offered vibrant and engaging colors, delivered deep blacks, and handled content optimization smoothly in real time. But its HDR performance underwhelmed, falling short of the 6-Series. That said, if you can find this panel on sale now that the new 2021 M-Series is rolling out, it’s worth considering.

75-inch Vizio P-Series Quantum X ($1,649.99, originally $1,899.99; bhphotovideo.com)

As we said in our full review, Vizio’s P-Series really impressed us. For $1,899.99, you’re getting a larger screen size over an OLED, but it’s also a different tech for the panel and this is a 2019 model. It still achieved deep contrast levels with high color accuracy and vibrancy, but the Sony A8H, the LG CX and even the Samsung Q800T managed to beat out the P-Series for the best overall and luxury pick slots in our testing.

65-inch Samsung Q800T ($3,199.99, originally $3,499.99; samsung.com)

At $3,499 (frequently on sale for $3,199), Samsung’s Q800T is a spectacular TV. You get an immense amount of detail and sharpness: Blacks are deep, colors are vibrant and accurate, and it can upscale content to 8K. Samsung’s processor works in real time to make content shine. The issue? There’s not (yet) enough 8K content available to justify the cost.

65-inch Sony X950H ($1,698; amazon.com)

We were impressed by Sony’s 65-inch version of the X950H. At its core, it’s a 4K LED TV with support for many standards, including HDR, and powered by the same X1 Ultimate Processor as the A8H. This means it can handle real-time optimization and upscale like a champ. The X950H is a great panel with vibrant images that don’t stray far from reality, producing surprisingly deep blacks for an LED screen. Simply put, however, considering its $1,698 price tag, you get more value from the $499 TCL 6-Series with just a small sacrifice in image quality.

LG CX 55 ($1,696.99; amazon.com)

In our race for best luxury pick, this OLED from LG was neck and neck with the Sony A8H. In the end, the Sony’s overall experience and visual reproduction gave it the edge. The CX 55 is a great OLED and more affordable if you want the smaller size. It delivers deep blacks and vibrant content, but we found the A8H gave us a more realistic view.

65-inch TCL 8-Series ($1,499, originally $1,999; bestbuy.com)

At close to $2,000, we expected a lot from the TCL 8-Series. It provides an enjoyable viewing experience and meets a lot of specs: QLED, mini-LED, Dolby Vision and HDR. But at this price point, it was lacking a wow factor and couldn’t compete with the OLED models. For a quarter of the price, the 6-Series is a better choice.

Note: The prices above reflect the retailers’ listed prices at the time of publication.

Andrew O'Reilly,Newsom orders closure of indoor activities across California as coronavirus cases increase,"California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Monday ordered a halt to indoor activities at certain businesses statewide as cases of coronavirus surge in the country’s most populous state.

Newsom, a Democrat, announced during a press briefing that all bars across the state must close up shop and that restaurants, wineries, tasting rooms, family entertainment centers, zoos, museums and card rooms must suspend indoor activities.

The governor also announced that all gyms, places of worship, malls, personal care services, barbershops, salons, and non-critical offices in counties on the state’s “monitoring list” had to shut down under the new order. The order affects more than 30 counties which are home to about 80 percent of California’s population.

CUOMO SAYS SCHOOLS IN NEW YORK CAN OPEN AGAINST ONCE REGION IS IN ‘PHASE 4’ OF CORONAVIRUS REOPENINGS

""We've made this point on multiple occasions and that is, we're moving back into a modification mode of our original stay-at-home order,"" Newsom said during his press briefing. ""This continues to be a deadly disease.”

As of Monday, the state had reported more than 320,000 COVID-19 cases and more than 7,000 deaths, with 23 people dying from the virus since Sunday. Los Angeles County – the country’s most populous county – leads both the state and the country in number of confirmed COVID-19 cases with more than 133,000, according to the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University.

LOS ANGELES, SAN DIEGO SCHOOLS TO RESUME ONLINE CLASSES IN FALL

In March, California became the first state to impose a mandatory stay-at-home order to slow the spread of the virus. Public health officials praised the state's quick action, marveling at how the nation's most populous state kept its cases and hospitalizations low while states like New York and New Jersey struggled to contain the highly contagious disease.

By late April, Newsom -- under increasing pressure – began allowing businesses and activities to resume, citing the state's increased hospital capacity to handle a new surge of cases. Cases began rising in early June and have exploded since, increasing 48 percent in the past two weeks, while hospitalizations have increased 40 percent.

Newsom’s announcement comes just hours after the state’s two largest school districts, Los Angeles and San Diego, announced they will not reopen for in-person instruction when the 2020-21 academic year begins next month. The districts said they will plan for in-person learning as health conditions allow.

Nicole Saphier,"Dr. Nicole Saphier: School reopenings – as a mom and physician, this is how we can reach our goal","With many respiratory illnesses, specifically the flu, children play a critical role in community spread. Also, their younger age equates to a simpler immune system, therefore, they tend to be more severely affected by such viruses.

The dynamic between children and COVID-19 is complex and far less understood. However, as puzzling as it may be, it has become apparent that children suggestively play a lesser role in coronavirus outbreaks than other common viral infections, not to mention, the far majority do not become as ill if they do get it.

Although several proposed reasons for this, it likely comes down to two main hypotheses: children having fewer ACE2 receptor cells in their respiratory tracts (necessary component for coronavirus to enter) and since the severity of COVID-19 seems directly linked to the body’s own immune response, children having a less complex immune system may be protective.

WHITE HOUSE SAYS GUIDELINES TO REOPEN SCHOOLS WILL BE UP TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

Not only may children be less likely to contract the viral infection themselves but also, it seems they may not transmit it as easily to others – an important factor when deciding to re-open schools.

A seroprevalence study out of Geneva, where scientists looked for antibodies in children and adults, demonstrated a significantly lower presence of antibodies in children aged 5–9 years compared with those aged 10–64 years. Also, a multi-national study estimated that susceptibility to infection in individuals under 20 years of age is approximately half that of adults aged over 20 years.

Across the globe when children who have returned to school do test positive for the virus, it's far more common for them to be infected by a family member, rather than at school.

Swiss researchers analyzed data on 39 children younger than 16 years of age and found that in nearly 80 percent of cases, the illness came from an adult in the house, according to a recent study in the journal Pediatrics. This data mirrors others produced by China, Netherlands and other countries that have reopened schools.

Although virtual learning is a great alternative when necessary, as a mother to three boys who were all home during the stay-at-home orders, I can tell you, it is not a long-term solution and certainly not equivalent to in-person education. Even the American Association of Pediatrics strongly urged all considerations for education this fall to include in-person classes:

“…The AAP strongly advocates that all policy considerations for the coming school year should start with a goal of having students physically present in school.”

Not only are the educational fundamentals subpar with distance-learning, but the lack of physical interaction is detrimental to their mental health and social development, especially our children <10 years old. Our teenagers and young adults have been socially distancing before it became fashionable with their social media and digital connectivity at all-time highs (which is not necessarily a good thing as I discuss in my book), so their development may be less affected.

Taking what we know about COVID-19, coupled with the recognized determinantal consequences of children staying home, we must be able to find a solution.

I understand our educators and multigenerational-home families are nervous returning to in-person classes. So am I! I live with an autoimmune disease that requires regular injections to tamper my immune system. When COVID-19 started and we saw people with comorbid conditions becoming severely ill, I was worried – I still am.

Like the many other front-line workers (grocery store clerks, janitorial staff, first responders, police officers and many more), I have taken the information we have learned the last few months to keep myself, my family and my patients safe. I am diligently arming myself with a mask, goggles and face shield, as well as hand washing and physically distancing as much as possible while indoors – all of which has allowed me to continue caring for others while also living my life. As public safety, grocery stores and medical care could not stop, childhood development, especially in our younger children, can't either.

Although much of the evidence is limited on the viral transmission amongst children since schools and playgrounds have largely been closed, it may take reopening schools for the picture to come into clearer focus. Within a month of reopening schools, it will become clear what the transmissibility of the virus amongst children and their caregivers is. It won’t be subtle.

And when we have our children go back to school invariably there will be outbreaks of a variety of respiratory viruses including colds, flu and COVID-19, which is why we should consider creating segregated bubbles throughout our school systems (social circles and workplaces should also consider this).

CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER

The Washington Post reported on how Germany has been able to manage clustered outbreaks while keeping schools open. The German model creates “classroom bubbles” by limiting integration amongst students and teachers. When a student or educator tests positive for COVID-19, that “bubble” is put into a two-week quarantine with remote online learning, while the remainder of the school continues uninterrupted.

If viral transmission remains high in a community, school openings will likely fail, mostly out of fear. It would be terrible to open schools just to close them again. As adults, it is up to us to decrease the amount of community virus prior to schools re-opening and throughout flu season.

If we commit to, at minimum, the next two weeks of diligent hand hygiene, avoidance of large outdoor gatherings and wearing a mask when unable to maintain 6 feet from others, then we will effectively lessen the amount of circulating virus, so our schools have no reason to adjourn.

The economic risk of not having children attend daycare/elementary school plus the developmental risk to the children themselves is a major public health emergency that cannot be marginalized.

Our children are the future and their educators are the front-line workers tasked with caring for their well-being. As a community we must step up to lessen community transmission and ensure the schools have the arsenal of protective equipment they need. Additionally, local, state and federal services must guarantee the support required to safely have our schools open.

Andrew O'Reilly,California's Newsom creates 'strike teams' to enforce business shutdowns amid coronavirus surge,"California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Wednesday that he has set up “multi-agency strike teams” to make sure businesses across the state are adhering to his orders to close shop as cases of COVID-19 surge.

The announcement by Newsom comes as he ordered a number of businesses across 19 of the state’s counties to suspend their indoor operations. During a press briefing, the governor said that restaurants, wineries, movie theaters, family entertainment centers, zoos, museums and card rooms must halt all indoor operations.

Newsom, who earlier this week ordered bars to close in a number of California counties, extended that mandate to include drinking establishments in other counties.

The strike teams -- which will consist of members from the state’s Alcohol Beverage Control, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Highway Patrol and other departments -- will target “non-compliant workplaces.”

CALIFORNIA COUNTY SHERIFF SAYS HE WON'T ENFORCE NEWSOM'S CORONAVIRUS MASK ORDER

Restaurants will still be allowed to offer food for pick-up or delivery. Newsom's new order lasts for three weeks.

“We’ll be looking at the health orders in relation to indoor vs. outdoor activities, the Fourth of July,” Newsom said Tuesday. “More broadly, beyond the Fourth of July.”

California on Monday recorded its highest daily coronavirus count for the third time in just over a week with 8,000 infections while also surpassing 6,000 deaths, officials said.

The uptick comes as the virus continues to make a resurgence after months of unprecedented orders to combat its spread. Newsom said Monday that hospitalizations have increased 43 percent over a two-week period, as well as a 37 percent increase of patients admitted to intensive care units during the same timeframe.

The COVID-19 positivity rate increased to nearly 6 percent, he said.

Statewide, more than 232,600 cases have been reported, in addition to over 6,000 deaths, according to the state Department of Public Health.

There is widespread concern among lawmakers in the state that the pandemic could worsen as people celebrate the July Fourth Holiday over the weekend -- much like it did when people crowded beaches and outdoor spots during the Memorial Day weekend.

Los Angeles County -- the epicenter of the virus in the state -- ordered all beaches closed for the holiday weekend after an ""alarming"" spike in new COVID-19 cases.

All parking facilities at state beaches in Southern California and the Bay Area will also be closed for the upcoming weekend. The closures reverse the reopening process that began weeks ago after months of unprecedented lockdowns.

In his announcement, Newsom pleaded with Californians to wear masks and practice social distancing.

""Wearing a face covering is a sign of toughness,"" he said. ""It's a sign of resolve. It's a sign of someone who gives a da--.""

Joseph Wulfsohn,Biden uses quote notably uttered by Mao Zedong during big-money fundraiser: reports,"Presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden raised eyebrows on Monday when he echoed rhetoric that was famously used by Chinese communist dictator Mao Zedong, according to reports.

Biden held a digital fundraiser featuring former President Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett. According to The Atlantic's Edward-Isaac Dovere, the former vice president ""cited an old Chinese proverb"" while discussing economic relief for women during a Q&A session.

“We’ve got to get real economic relief into women’s hands now,” Biden reportedly said, later saying that “women hold up half the sky.”

CHINA ANNOUNCES SANCTIONS AGAINST RUBIO, CRUZ OVER UIGHER MUSLIMS

The saying ""women hold up half the sky,"" however, is not a proverb but a famous proclamation made by Mao roughly 70 years ago, when he proclaimed gender equality at the beginning of his rule.

Biden was reportedly speaking about how the financial turmoil that spawned from the coronavirus outbreak has disproportionately affected women, saying, '""For the first time, an economic crisis is hitting industries dominated by women.”

China has become quite a political issue during the election cycle, with both the Biden and Trump campaigns accusing the other of being weak toward the communist nation. President Trump has slammed the former vice president over his son Hunter Biden's financial ties to China, while Biden has repeatedly gone after Trump for paying compliments to Chinese President Xi Jinping for his handling of the coronavirus outbreak in the early weeks.

Morgan Phillips,AOC doubles down amid GOP criticism over take on NYC crime,"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defended comments she made over the weekend suggesting that the crime surge in New York City is likely because struggling residents are forced to shoplift in order to ""feed their child” by saying Republicans haven’t “experienced or seen” poverty.

“Republicans are all upset that I’m connecting the dots between poverty and crime,” the progressive firebrand tweeted. “I know most of them haven’t experienced or seen these issues first hand, but I have. This may be hard for them to admit, but poverty and crime are highly linked, both violent & nonviolent alike.”

In a virtual town hall meeting she hosted Thursday, some clips of which were shared by The Hill, the 30-year-old Democratic congresswoman was asked about the troubling uptick in violent crimes overtaking the city.

“Do we think this has to do with the fact that there’s record unemployment in the United States right now?"" she responded. ""The fact that people are at a level of economic desperation that we have not seen since the Great Recession?""

AOC SUGGESTS NYC CRIME SURGE DUE TO UNEMPLOYMENT, RESIDENTS WHO NEED TO 'SHOPLIFT SOME BREAD'

""Maybe this has to do with the fact that people aren't paying their rent and are scared to pay their rent and so they go out, and they need to feed their child and they don't have money,"" Ocasio-Cortez continued, adding that “they’re put in a position where they feel like they either need to shoplift some bread or go hungry that night.”

The latest jobless claims figures from the Labor Department push the number of job losses since the shutdown began to nearly 50 million – or roughly 31 percent of the nation's workforce.

The New York Police Department (NYPD) has reported a staggering increase in shootings and violent crimes in recent weeks. On Saturday, the New York Post reported 15 shootings in 15 hours, just one week after the city saw a bloody July Fourth weekend with 44 shootings and at least eight killed.

Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee called the congresswoman’s comments “astonishing” on “America’s Newsroom.”

“There’s a big difference between shoplifting and cold-blooded murder and for her not to know the difference is frankly astonishing,” Huckabee said.

Host John Roberts brought up the fact that a 1-year-old was shot and killed and three other people were injured late Sunday night at a family cookout in a Brooklyn park, according to authorities.

“Her saying, ‘people are hungry so they’re going out and lifting bread,’ no, they are going out and killing people randomly,” Huckabee said.

“You don't kill a 1-year-old because you need some bread, that doesn’t put bread on your table and that's why the absurdity of her [Ocasio-Cortez’s] remarks have to be called out.”

“She needs to be held accountable for this,” he continued. “She needs to walk it back and recognize that violent crime has nothing to do with people's lifting some bread.”

New York City recently cut the NYPD budget by $1 billion, but Ocasio-Cortez has criticized the cuts for not reaching far enough, and accused de Blasio of using ""budget tricks"" and ""funny math"" in the calculation. Others, including former law enforcement officials, have made the same argument about budget gimicks being used reach the $1 billion figure.

Howard Kurtz,"Trump White House slams Fauci, cancels his TV appearances","The commutation of Roger Stone’s sentence may have more profound legal implications, and the Redskins changing their name may have more cultural significance.

But the escalating warfare between President Trump and Anthony Fauci may well have a more immediate impact on the pandemic that is increasingly devastating our country.

While it’s easy to cast this as merely a media-generated feud, it represents a fundamental clash over how to handle the coronavirus that keeps breaking records, rather than fading with the July heat, as the administration once predicted.

TRUMP VS. STATES AND SCHOOLS: POLITICAL PRESSURE DESPITE LOCAL CONTROL

To be sure, the charge that the White House has done an “oppo dump” on Fauci is rather overblown. To me, that signifies a stealthy handoff of documents or encoded digital communication to get dirt into the hands of reporters. The Trump team is just stabbing Fauci in the front.

And they’re doing it by pointing to his past public statements, which are obviously fair game.

Behind the scenes, the president hasn’t spoken to Fauci in more than a month.

Make no mistake, the president is the decision-maker and Fauci is a medical expert who, by his own account, is not in charge of setting policy. Still, the 79-year-old doctor, who has been part of the government’s infectious disease agency since the Reagan administration, is widely respected, and part of his job is to work on a vaccine.

For an administration that has been accused of ignoring science, this seems somewhat petty. But there is an important clash here: Fauci casts himself as a truth-teller, and Trump wants to control the administration’s message, which is that the pandemic is under control and things will be getting better.

That, admittedly, is a harder sell when the number of new daily Covid-19 cases surged past 66,000 heading into the weekend, and Florida broke the single-day record for a state on Sunday with more than 15,000 cases. And it comes at a time when the president is pressuring governors, with a threatened funding cutoff, to physically reopen the nation’s schools in September.

What the White House has done, among other things, is basically kept Fauci off television. “Face the Nation” host Margaret Brennan told viewers she’s been trying to book him for three months. The coronavirus task force briefings have become infrequent, handed off to Mike Pence and moved out of the White House, and Fauci’s schedule was such that he couldn’t attend the last one.

SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES

Instead, he’s been doing podcasts and print interviews, such as one in which he told the Financial Times: “I have a reputation, as you have probably figured out, of speaking the truth at all times and not sugar-coating things. And that may be one of the reasons why I haven’t been on television very much lately.”

The Washington Post reports that White House communications aides did approve appearances by Fauci on the PBS “NewsHour,” “Meet the Press” and a CNN town hall. But those were canceled after Fauci did a Facebook Live event with Democratic Sen. Doug Jones and disputed Trump’s assertion that the country’s lower death rate was a sign of progress, calling that a “false narrative.”

“Our bigger issue with Fauci is stop critiquing the task force . . . and try to fix it,” an administration official told the Post.

Trump, for his part, has called Fauci “a nice man, but he’s made a lot of mistakes.”

Which brings us to the official counterattack.

“Several White House officials are concerned about the number of times Dr. Fauci has been wrong on things,” says a statement sent by the White House to reporters.

The Post says this “included a lengthy list of the scientist’s comments from early in the outbreak. Those included his early doubt that people with no symptoms could play a significant role in spreading the virus...They also point to public reassurances Fauci made in late February, around the time of the first U.S. case of community transmission, that “at this moment, there is no need to change anything that you’re doing on a day-by-day basis.”

Sure he’s made some missteps, Fauci’s supporters say. But when he downplayed the need for masks early on, it was because he was worried about a shortage and wanted to keep them for health care workers.

The New York Times, in picking up the story yesterday, said the White House left out Fauci’s words, in an NBC interview, immediately after his “no need to change anything” comment:

“Right now the risk is still low, but this could change. When you start to see community spread, this could change and force you to become much more attentive to doing things that would protect you from spread.”

Asked yesterday by CNN’s Jim Acosta why the White House was “trashing” Fauci, press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said the statement came in response to the Post’s questions and the two men “have always had a very good working relationship.”

The president has mentioned Fauci’s high approval ratings. A Times poll last month found that 67 percent of Americans trusted Fauci on Covid-19, while 26 percent trusted Trump.

If Fauci was a political appointee, he’d probably have gone the way of Jeff Sessions, Jim Mattis and John Bolton by now. But as a career civil servant, he can’t be fired. So the White House is clearly sidelining him instead.

It’s a shame the two men, despite their contrasting styles, can’t find a way to work together, as this is a distraction in the war on their common enemy: the virus itself.

Footnote: President Trump has retweeted the following missive from game show host Chuck Woolery:

“The most outrageous lies are the ones about Covid 19. Everyone is lying. The CDC, Media, Democrats, our Doctors, not all but most ,that we are told to trust. I think it’s all about the election and keeping the economy from coming back, which is about the election. I’m sick of it…There is so much evidence, yes scientific evidence, that schools should open this fall. It’s worldwide and it’s overwhelming. BUT NO.”",2020-07-14,https://www.foxnews.com/media/trump-white-house-slams-fauci-cancels-his-tv-appearances
Joseph Wulfsohn,"Washington Post editor says Texas Rangers name 'must go,' gets slammed by critics","Washington Post Global Opinions editor Karen Attiah argued on Monday that the Texas Rangers as a team name ""must go.""

On the heels of the Washington Redskins retiring its name and mascot amid pressure from critics and corporate sponsors, an op-ed written by Attiah made the case that ""to know the full history of the Texas Rangers is to understand that the team’s name is not so far off from being called the Texas Klansmen.""

Growing up in Dallas, Attiah recalled going to Rangers games with her father as a child, but not realizing at the time that the Rangers ""were a cruel, racist force when it came to the nonwhites who inhabited the beautiful and untamed Texas territory.""

NBA RAISES EYEBROWS FOR NOT ALLOWING CUSTOMERS TO PRINT 'FREEHONGKONG' ON CUSTOM GEAR

""The Rangers oppressed black people, helping capture runaway slaves trying to escape to Mexico; in the aftermath of the Civil War, they killed free blacks with impunity,"" Attiah wrote. ""In the early 20th century, Rangers played a key role in some of the worst episodes of racial violence in American history along the Texas-Mexico border. Mexicans were run out of their homes and subject to mass lynchings and shootings. The killings got so out of control that the federal government threatened to intervene.""

The opinion editor warned that ""Ranger racism"" spanned decades, writing how Rangers ""would be called on to protect white supremacy into the 1960s"" and were ""deployed to prevent school integration.""

She then accused the Texas Rangers of ""revisionist history"" after the team recently issued a statement condemning racism and bigotry.

Attiah, who was one of the signatories on the letter written in response to the Harper's Magazine letter decrying cancel culture, concluded her op-ed by calling on the Texas Rangers name to be canceled.

""If the team ownership, as it proclaims, condemns “racism, bigotry and discrimination in all forms,” there is an easy way for it to prove that. The Texas Rangers’ team name must go,"" Attiah concluded.

WASHINGTON POST'S JENNIFER RUBIN MOCKED FOR CALLING NEW YORK GOVERNMENT'S COVID RESPONSE 'COMPETENT'

The column faced a backlash from some quarters on social media.

Fourth Watch media critic Steve Krakauer jokingly reacted by sharing a ""Going out of business, everything must go!"" sign regarding sports team names.

""Let’s strike a real blow for racial justice and ban sports entirely,"" media company Grabien founder and news editor Tom Elliot similarly said.

""Many pirates were involved in the slave trade. The Pittsburgh Pirates' team name must go,"" Spectator USA editor Amber Athey sarcastically suggested about another MLB team.

National Review senior writer Michael Brendan Dougherty added ""Indians, Yankees, Vikings, and Irish"" to Attiah's hit list since sports organizations ""can’t name a team after groups that commit atrocities.""

Charles Creitz,Trump campaign spokesman warns 'American way of life is not safe' if Biden wins in November,"Trump 2020 campaign national press secretary Hogan Gidley told ""The Story"" Monday that the American way of life is at stake in November's presidential election.

""Make no mistake, talking about Joe Biden, you don't have to guess what his economy would look like,"" Gidley told host Martha MacCallum. ""You saw it for eight years [of the Obama administration]; depressed wages, jobs leaving our shores -- three million going to China alone -- you don't have guess what the culture looks like.

""He'll pop out of his basement every once in a while to say 'Defund the police!'"" Gidley predicted. ""Our jobs aren't safe, families aren't safe, and our American way of life is not safe ... Joe Biden is waging war on all three.""

Gidley also denied suggestions that support for Trump is sagging, telling MacCallum that the campaign's online events have drawn 1.1 billion video views across all social media platforms.

The events, which take place seven days a week, are often hosted by the president's daughter-in-law, Lara Trump. A ""Father's Day Special"" broadcast, in which President Trump was interviewed by his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., drew 5.2 million views, whil the Black Voices for Trump organization has held nine broadcasts that have drawn more than 18 million views

""When we see the numbers of registered Republicans outpacing that of Democrats in key swing states we're doing something right,"" Gidley told MacCallum. ""Money [is being] raised at a pace nobody thought possible and that's because we have a great candidate.""

MacCallum then pressed Gidley on whether plans to hold the Republican National Convention in Jacksonville, Fla., are still on despite the increase in coronavirus cases across the state.

""We're looking to move forward with it in Jacksonville -- the president is very excited about it -- but he wants the American people to be safe,"" Gidley answered. ""He cares about the health and the safety and the security of the people that come to the convention ... We're working with people on the ground with Governor [Ron] DeSantis and his office, the mayor as well, the RNC, all the local officials and quite frankly the health experts because we want to make sure, if we proceed forward, [of] how it looks and the measures that need to be in place to make sure that when this thing goes off, it goes off safely.""",2020-07-14,https://www.foxnews.com/media/trump-2020-campaign-hogan-gidley-online-presence-biden

HOUSE DEMS PROMISE INVESTIGATIONS AFTER TRUMP COMMUTES ROGER STONE

Hume explained that in January 2001, President Bill Clinton famously pardoned trader Marc Rich just hours before he left office, Hume explained. Known as the ""King of Commodities,"" Rich fled the United States to Switzerland in 1983 after being indicted by a federal grand jury and remained on the FBI's Most Wanted List until he was pardoned. He died in Switzerland in 2013.

""It looked to all the world like a payoff because Rich's wife had given tons of money to the Democrats and the Clinton's campaign,"" Hume recalled.

Clinton also pardoned Susan McDougal, his former business partner and one of the many people prosecuted in the Whitewater controversy.

ANDY MCCARTHY: MEDIA, DEMS' REACTION TO STONE COMMUTATION 'REMARKABLE'

""She balked at certain key questions as to the president's truthfulness,"" during her testimony, Hume explained.

Clinton ""later pardoned her and later held her up as a hero ... "" the analyst went on, ""so while Democrats are getting on the fanning couch with Nancy Pelosi and talking about 'staggering corruption and national security implications' from the commutation, it seems that what they need to do is consult their own record books and remember what has gone before them.""

Charles Creitz,"Watters raps critics of Roger Stone commutation: 'Bill Clinton, didn't he pardon his brother?'","""The Five"" co-host Jesse Watters claimed Monday that critics of President Trump's decision to commute the prison sentence of longtime Republican political consultant Roger Stone are mostly upset that the ""witch hunt got exposed.""

""Stone's no saint and he has been in the gutter for decades, but he is not a criminal either,"" the ""Watters's World"" host said. ""He is an old man who likes to talk a lot of trash and got caught up in a frame job.""

The 67-year-old Stone was due to report to federal prison Tuesday to begin a 40-month sentence after he was convicted in November 2019 on seven counts of obstruction, witness tampering and making false statements to Congress in connection with the Russia investigation.

""If a guy plants a gun on you and he is a police officer and you throw the gun in the river, you cannot be charged with obstruction,"" Watters continued. ""It is a dirty investigation, and we know it was a baseless investigation. There was no collusion.""

Trump's commutation of Stone's sentence has drawn criticism from Democrats and the media, as well as Republican Sens. Mitt Romney of Utah and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania.

Watters then pointed to what he considered to be more egregious pardons by Democratic presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton. Obama, he noted, commuted the sentence of former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning, who was convicted of passing classified information to Wikileaks.

Co-host Greg Gutfeld chimed in that Obama also commuted the sentence of Oscar Lopez Rivera, a leader of the Puerto Rican separatist terror group FALN -- which has claimed responsibility for dozens of urban bombings in the U.S.

Charles Creitz,Laura Ingraham lays out her 'new normal' for GOP: 'Anti-leftist ... pro-American ... pro-worker',"In her ""Ingraham Angle"" monologue Monday, Fox News host Laura Ingraham argued that presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden is no longer the moderate or establishment Democrat from a working-class background, but instead the leader of the leftward lurch in American politics toward a ""new normal.""

""The Biden campaign has made it official. No more Mr. Moderate from Wilmington. Over the July 4 weekend, he pledged to fundamentally transform the United States,"" Ingraham said.

""Translation? A grab bag of Squad-approved measures that begin with massive wealth confiscation -- it's coming your way,"" she went on. ""Your money is going to be used to fund a war on oil and gas, regulatory harassment of businesses, massive amnesty and a flood of foreign workers and refugees, gun compensation from citizens on bogus grounds, a radicalization of our schools... Free health care -- including medical marijuana -- for illegals, government-run health care and of course, reparations.""

Ingraham then warned that anyone who opposes those objectives and policies will be targeted for ""retrbution.""

""The DOJ, the FBI, OSHA, the NSA -- are going to be activated against hardworking Americans who still believe in freedom,"" she claimed, arguing that a new administration would be eager to use strongarm tactics in the same way governors have made citizens ""bend and relinquish their rights ... for the greater good.""

""This is nothing to do with the virus, which is overwhelmingly survivable for most Americans,"" Ingraham said. ""And these draconian and arbitrary moves are about politics and power.""

As an alternative, the host laid out several tenets of a ""new normal"" that enshrines Americanism, vowing the GOP will never look back to the ""Bush Party"" of the 1990s and 2000s.

""I realize this may upset the dozens of well-funded Trump-hating Republicans out there, nevertheless, our new normal will be ardently anti-leftist, fervently pro-American and a relentlessly pro-worker party,"" she said.

""Have you noticed how many Republicans have been heading for the hills when the going has gotten tough in recent months? I can count on one, maybe two hands the number of people who are leading the push against BLM, Antifa, even China, and now, of course, the Democrats' attacks on basic American institutions ...

Ingraham then announced the first tenet of the new Americanism: ""Supporting only those who fight to save America. So before you give a dime to a conservative group or a think tank or a candidate, or a campaign, ask yourself -- where were they when we needed them?

""Number two: preserving our history, our Declaration, and Constitution. We will proudly protect our national holidays and our monuments and some of the names of our states and cities, and we will embark on an effort to educate America on the greatness of our Founders and key historical events in our progress.

""Number three, no more lockdowns. Viruses are a fact of life, and it's very sad. And sometimes, as with COVID-19, there will be awful, tragic results. We need to try to find treatments, but trampling on our basic rights and wrecking businesses, ruining livelihoods, bankrupting our country, is simply no longer an option.

Andrew O'Reilly,"House Dems release Berman interview transcript, as GOP says Barr ‘acted appropriately’ in ousting prosecutor","The House Judiciary Committee released Monday the transcript of its interview last week with former U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Geoffrey Berman in which he alleges that Attorney General Bill Barr tried to “entice” him to step down from his position.

Berman, who during his time as the U.S. Attorney of the SDNY launched several investigations into President Trump and people connected with him, said during his testimony that Barr told him he could either resign from his post or be fired.

Barr “was trying to entice me to resign so that an outsider could be put into the acting U.S. attorney position at the Southern District of New York, which would have resulted in the delay and disruption of ongoing investigations,” Berman said in his testimony, according to the transcript. “You know, he wanted me to resign to take a position. I assume you could call that a quid pro quo. You resign and you get this, that would mean quid pro quo.”

Berman added: “The Attorney General said that if I did not resign from my position I would be fired. He added that getting fired from my job would not be good for my resume or future job prospects. I told him that, while I did not want to get fired, I would not resign.”

BARR SAID TRUMP FIRED SDNY PROSECUTOR WHO REFUSED TO LEAVE, TRUMP SAYS HE'S 'NOT INVOLVED'

Barr informed Berman late last month that he was fired from his post as U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. At the time, Barr said he asked Trump to fire Berman after the Manhattan federal prosecutor said Friday he planned to stay on the job against the Trump administration's wishes.

Berman’s appearance was the latest event in a highly publicized feud between the former U.S. attorney and the Trump administration.

Barr and the White House announced in June that Trump will nominate Jay Clayton, the current chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), to replace Berman. But Berman, whose office has been a thorn in Trump's side, said he learned of his ""departure"" from Barr's press release and had no intention of leaving the job.

Barr initially said the U.S. attorney in New Jersey, Craig Carpenito, would take over on an acting basis beginning July 3 until Jay Clayton's SEC confirmation. But Barr switched gears afterwards by announcing Strauss would manage the SDNY in the interim.

Democrats accused the Trump administration of trying to shut down Berman, who is leading investigations into the president's allies.

DEMS SEIZE ON US ATTORNEY FIRING TO PURSUE NEW PROBES, HEARINGS

The Southern District has prosecuted a number of Trump associates, including the president's former personal lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen, who served a prison sentence for lying to Congress and campaign finance crimes. The office has also been investigating Trump personal attorney Rudy Giuliani’s business dealings, including whether he failed to register as a foreign agent, people familiar with the probe told The Associated Press.

Berman has also overseen the prosecution of two Florida businessmen, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who were associates of Giuliani and tied to the Ukraine impeachment investigation. The men were charged in October with federal campaign finance violations, including hiding the origin of a $325,000 donation to a group supporting Trump’s reelection.

“When he appeared before the Committee last week, Mr. Berman could not comment on these cases—but he was adamant that Attorney General Barr’s scheme to force him out of office and replace him with an outsider raised serious concerns for him, and was designed to disrupt and delay the work of the office—including those implicating the President,” House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., said in a press release.

Republicans on the committee, however, argue that the Judiciary investigation into Berman’s firing is an attempt by Democrats “to manufacture a scandal where one does not exist.”

""Chairman Nadler and Committee Democrats remain obsessed with attacking the President and Attorney General for political gain,” Republicans on the committee – led by Ranking Member Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, wrote in a note. “This singular obsession has clouded their judgment and colored their opinions.”

It continued: “Contrary to Chairman Nadler’s portrayal, the interview proved that Attorney General Barr acted appropriately at all times, including and especially in his interactions with Berman. The interview uncovered no evidence of misconduct, wrongdoing, or criminality.”

The House Judiciary Committee is also leading an investigation into the “unprecedented politicization” at the Justice Department under Barr’s leadership.

Barr accepted an invitation to appear before the committee, and is expected to testify in public for a “general oversight hearing” on July 28, the Justice Department confirmed.

Frank Miles,Dozens of world’s richest people demand higer taxes to pay for coronavirus economic recovery,"A group of 83 of the richest people in the world have called for “our governments to raise taxes on people like us"" to help fund the economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, according to The Guardian.

In the letter, which was shared with the British newspaper, the signatories called for the increases to take effect ""Immediately. Substantially. Permanently”

“As Covid-19 strikes the world, millionaires like us have a critical role to play in healing our world,” the letter reads in part. “No, we are not the ones caring for the sick in intensive care wards. We are not driving the ambulances that will bring the ill to hospitals. We are not restocking grocery store shelves or delivering food door to door. But we do have money, lots of it. Money that is desperately needed now and will continue to be needed in the years ahead, as our world recovers from this crisis.”

LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WEIGH MAJOR TAX HIKES TO PLUG CORONAVIRUS-INDUCED SHORTFALLS

The letter went on to claim that the fallout from the pandemic will “last for decades” and could “push half a billion more people into poverty.”

Also Monday, the United Nations said the ranks of the world’s hungry grew by 10 million last year and warned that the coronavirus could push as many as 130 million more people into chronic hunger this year.

The grim assessment was contained in the latest edition of the State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World, an annual report released by five U.N. agencies.

Preliminary projections based on available global economic outlooks suggest the pandemic “may add an additional 83 (million) to 132 million people to the ranks of the undernourished in 2020,” the report said.

The letter demands worldwide governments “address global inequality and acknowledge that tax increases on the wealthy and greater international tax transparency are essential for a viable long-term solution.”

“The problems caused by, and revealed by, Covid-19 can’t be solved with charity, no matter how generous. Government leaders must take the responsibility for raising the funds we need and spending them fairly,” the letter said. “We owe a huge debt to the people working on the frontlines of this global battle. Most essential workers are grossly underpaid for the burden they carry.”

Hollie Mckay,Iran’s nuclear facilities are mysteriously under attack,"Black smoke rose as flames engulfed the Shahid Tondgooyan petrochemical plant in the Khuzestan province of Iran late Sunday afternoon.

Hours earlier, more than 500 miles away, detonations rocked the basement of an old, nondescript home in a northern pocket of Tehran. The two-story dwelling was said to have housed at least 30 gas cylinders that were used for unclear purposes.

Both incidents came fewer than two days after a string of explosions – and power outages – were reported west of Tehran in the early hours of Friday. Local reports indicated that multiple “mortar-like sounds similar to anti-aircraft missiles” were heard.

The blasts reportedly took place at an Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) missile depot.

IRAN BLAMES UKRAINIAN JETLINER SHOOTDOWN ON MISCOMMUNICATION, MISALIGNED MISSILE BATTERY

While some Iranian officials denied the outbursts altogether, and others quoted a former mayor – who reportedly died more than a year ago – as saying it was caused by gas tanks, experts said there is something bizarre at play across the beleaguered country.

These most recent attacks happened on the heels of multiple other mysterious explosions at sensitive sites over the course of the last three weeks – and no one is precisely sure what is going on, other than its rattling of the regime and stymying its controversial nuclear program.

""The tempo and tenor of the recent explosions in Iran have been unusual. There is evidence of a concerted campaign underway to thwart Iran's nuclear program,"" Jason Brodsky, Policy Director of United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI), told Fox News. ""The more Iran advances its nuclear program in violation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the greater the likelihood for additional strikes.""

He continued: ""Additionally, Tehran is distracted by the coronavirus and economic problems. The public is increasingly disenchanted with the regime's ability to govern the country. The conditions are ripe for additional kinetic activity.""

UN ACCUSES TRUMP OF BREAKING INTERNATIONAL LAW IN SOLEIMANI KILLING

The first enigmatic hit happened on June 26 at a known liquid fuel production center that makes ballistic missiles in Khojir, near Parchin, southeast of the capital. Despite a downplaying by officials, satellite images later emerged to show extensive damage on an arsenal of gas tanks, along with an entire hillside blackened in the blast.

Then on June 30, 19 people died following an explosion at a medical center in Tehran.

Two days later, on July 2, the notorious Natanz uranium enrichment plant – which became active in 2018 as Iran's principal place to develop centrifuges required to produce uranium and other nuclear weapons were in-development – was struck by a mammoth blast, as confirmed by the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI).

Tehran conceded that a severe attack had impaired an ""industrial shed,"" and AEOI officials acknowledged to the Iranian media that the blow had ""set back Iran's nuclear program by months.""

IRAN NUCLEAR SITE FIRE HIT CENTRIFUGE FACILITY, ANALYSTS SAY

According to an analysis by the Kuwait-based publication Al-Jarida, the target of the assault was the UF6 gas – uranium hexafluoride – which Iran uses to infuse into its most advanced IR-6 centrifuges – of which 80 percent has been decimated as a result of the attack.

Then, on July 3, an unexplained fire erupted at a power plant in the southwest city of Shiraz, triggering a power outage in the region.

The next day, yet another explosion and inferno tore through a power plant in Ahwaz, while at the same time, a chlorine gas leak was detected at a Karoun petrochemical plant in Mahshahr, about 75 miles away.

""While one can never ignore the potential for an accident or gross incompetence, the locations of these explosions coupled with the increasing number of things exploding in the last few weeks does make a strong case for this being foreign sabotage,"" underscored Behnam Ben Taleblu, a senior fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies (FDD). ""Let's not forget, they are all occurring on or near, nuclear, missile, or military installations.""

Nonetheless, a swirl of suspicion continues to linger around the series of seemingly harmonized attacks, with many suspecting Israel – and the United States – as pulling strings.

But adding to the peculiarity, BBC Persian reported that just after midnight on June 30, some of its journalists received an email from a group purporting to be the ""Homeland Cheetahs"" – comprised of anti-government, underground dissidents – claiming credit for earlier attacks. The outlet also said they were informed of the Natanz attack hours before it was documented by officials.

Several intelligence sources told Fox News that they had never heard of the outfit prior to the BBC's report, and suspected it to be a ruse or a front for a much more sophisticated operation.

THE RISE AND FALL OF SYRIA'S FIRST LADY: WHY THE US IS GOING AFTER ASMA ASSAD?

While almost all experts conclude that the attacks that have occurred are physical, some say cyber warfare may additionally play a part – especially given that Natanz was targeted by the infamous Stuxnet malware kindled by Israel and the U.S. in 2010. That attack successfully crippled controls at the site by altering the spin cycles of the centrifuges and left scientists scratching their heads.

""Although many are asking the question, was this a cyber-attack or physical sabotage, the answer could be 'both.' The most likely suspects are the U.S. and Israel working in tandem. Both countries have very sophisticated cyber warfare units and significant capabilities when it comes to cyber-kinetic attacks,"" explained David Kennedy, CEO of TrustedSec and a former NSA and Marine Corps cyber-intelligence expert. ""An attack of this magnitude would require a great deal of planning and preparation, and is very complex because you are exploiting industrial control systems and air-gapped devices.""

Jeff Bardin, CIO of security firm Treadstone 71, concurred that their assessment ""indicates this was a physical attack likely with cyber used for reconnaissance and support.""

""The explosion was far beyond what is believed cyber sabotage could have created,"" he said. ""If Iran complains too loudly that adversaries destroyed their nuclear weapons development, the IAEA and the world will want a local inspection – Iran has claimed they are not creating nuclear weapons. If they complain too loudly, we can confirm those locations for nuclear weapons development. If Iranian authorities claim adversary actions occurred, internally, they look weak, where they already suffer a lack of confidence. If they openly respond, they risk more attacks.""

Experts have also pointed to the glaring holes in Tehran's intelligence apparatus – essentially allowing its country's most guarded sites to be slaughtered with convention weapons, with little means of foiling it or fighting back.

""Tehran has not yet retaliated for the Natanz explosion. (But) I would expect to see an uptick in Iranian cyber operations against the U.S., Israel, and our Mideast allies like Saudi Arabia, but I don't expect a serious conflagration,"" Kennedy surmised. ""The Iranians have suffered a major setback to their nuclear program and their domestic security. They've been badly embarrassed. And the truth is, they may not know the full extent of what happened in that attack. They also don't know what else is coming.""",2020-07-14,https://www.foxnews.com/world/irans-nuclear-facilities-are-mysteriously-under-attack
Steve Hilton,Steve Hilton: Reopen our schools or give me my school money back,"Coronavirus misinformation is now seriously hurting America as the establishment media hypes case numbers as the only measure. Take a look at this from CNN recently:

DON LEMON, CNN ANCHOR: Today, the country recorded the most new cases in a single day, 58,699. Shameful. It feels like that we're back at the beginning of this pandemic.

What are you talking about? As you open up, cases go up!

DR. TOM FRIEDEN: CORONAVIRUS HAS THE UPPER HAND, BUT WE CAN STILL STOP THE VIRUS

Do you think cases aren't going up in other countries as they reopen? Of course, they are. They're just not testing asymptomatic people on the scale we are here.

As you open up, of course, hospitalizations go up. Sick people kept out of hospitals because of the shutdowns now finally getting treated.

And of course, if you jump overnight to the final stage of all the reopening plans, large gatherings, you get a massive increase in cases.

Now, who did that? Who gave the go-ahead for large gatherings long before the virus was under control?

No, not the evil Trump. It was you, Mayor Bill de Blasio. It was you, Mayor Eric Garcetti. It was you, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and all the rest around the country cheered on by thousand doctors, and every two-face cynical liar on CNN and MSNBC.

When it's a large gathering for Trump in, I don't know -- Tulsa -- to pick a random example -- that's an irresponsible health risk that will send cases skyrocketing.

But when it's a large gathering for police reform, which as you know, I support, obviously, that's got nothing to do with cases rising.

I mean, what possible connection could there be between large gatherings of young people and coronavirus spreading amongst young people?

But for the media, facts are just lies.

Here's more from CNN:

ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR: We are so deep down into a well of lies. It is hard to even realize how dark this is.

Dark?! It's totally Orwellian.

Anderson Cooper literally calls his lying rants, ""Keeping Them Honest.""

I don't know if he is even worth trying to keep him honest. After all, he's now effectively on Joe Biden's campaign staff, but just in case he goes.

The one measure you'll never see on CNN or MSNBC is the only one that really matters. The only one that is actually a fair description of what's going on -- and that is deaths per capita.

Here's the actual data. The U.K., Spain, Italy in France, not to mention Belgium and a few others, those countries are all doing worse than we are in America.

Andrew Cuomo's New York rate, fawningly praised by the idiots in the media, is nearly 10 times worse than Ron DeSantis' Florida.

The supposed disaster zones of Arizona and Texas, also at the bottom of the list, but sure, blame Trump and Republican governance for the worst outbreak by far.

And blame him, too, even when what he says is what an actual doctor says.

Ninety-nine percent of people who get infected says the Hoover Institution's Dr. Scott Atlas, in fact, have no significant problem with the infection. And who are those who really have no significant problem with the infection? Children. Children under 18 make up 5.9 percent of U.S. cases and children under 14 just 0.03 percent of deaths.

Yet still, we see officials across the country debating whether to reopen schools in the fall. The risk to children from coronavirus is a fraction of the risk from flu every single year. No one ever talked about closing schools for that.

People say, okay, children may not get seriously ill from this virus, but they might pass it on to their families.

Really? In one study they write, ""We have not found a single instance of a child infecting parents.""

They lecture about contact tracing. Well, they did it for a boy with coronavirus. He came into contact with 172 classmates and teachers while symptomatic and didn't transmit the disease to any of them, not one out of 172 people.

In Switzerland, the country's head of infectious disease says ""scientists now know young children don't transmit the virus.""

Because of all of this, countless other countries, starting with Denmark, had already begun reopening schools before the summer break.

When the president pointed that out this week, the idiots said, ah, but we have thousands of new cases a day and Denmark doesn't.

But Denmark reopened schools months ago.

If you equalize for population size and testing rates, there's nothing like the difference in case numbers between the U.S. now and Denmark then, and the data shows that reopening schools didn't worsen their outbreak at all, and yet here in America, summer camps are closed and school plans are in doubt.

This is not safe. It's harming our children.

Almost a third of parents say their children's emotional and mental health is suffering. Another third worry that it'll start hurting their children soon.

It's hurting their education and their future prospects, too.

The evidence is piling up that remote learning doesn't work, especially for the poorest families and those in rural areas with unreliable internet.

And perhaps, worst of all, we're seeing reports of a rise in child abuse. Beyond the impact on children, there's the impact on our economy. If kids can't go to school, parents can't go to work. Here is a farmer from Minnesota this week.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The really big question mark right now is whether there'll be school here this fall. Because harvest season -- almost more than planting -- is all hands on deck. That would be really, really difficult to manage both kids with no childcare.

And by the way, schools open one day a week or three days a week or in the morning or the afternoon or whatever other pseudo-scientific bureaucratic claptrap they come up with. It's still a disaster.

Responding to New York's one to three-day week plan, the leading employers' group was crystal clear, people will not be able to go back to work.

Australia gets all of this. Its deputy chief medical officer said the evidence does not support avoiding classroom learning as a means to control COVID.

In Canada, they get all this. Experts at the Toronto Children's Hospital called for opening schools with no restrictions. Masks, they say if worn incorrectly, it could lead to increased risk of infection, and it's not practical for a child to wear a mask properly for the duration of a school day.

Strict physical distancing, they say, should not be emphasized to children in a school setting as it is not practical and could cause significant psychological harm.

In line with all those medical experts, President Trump gets all this. Here's what he said:

DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We're very much going to put pressure on governors and everybody else to open the schools, to get them open, and it's very important. It's very important for our country. It's very important for the well-being of the student and the parents.

But with all this damage, all this pain and all this scientific evidence, still there isn't a clear back to school instruction from the CDC, from the people we're told to trust.

Still, they witter on about an abundance of caution or risk aversion; still, they trot out their weasel words to cover their you know what. Here's Dr. Fauci this week:

DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: The broad approach would be obviously, but paying attention to the safety of the children, which is always paramount, but within the context of doing whatever you can to safeguard the health and the welfare of the children, we should try to get the schools open.

In Denmark, they are definitive. In Australia, in Canada, in England, in Switzerland, in Iceland for goodness sake!

So, why is our own CDC, preposterously praised by the media as the best public health agency in the world, still hemming and hawing on these vital questions when other countries have done the research and published clear conclusions.

What have you been doing Dr. Redfield? You've had January, February, March, April, May, June. No wonder the president is forcing the pace. Of course, he is right to use the leverage of federal money. But frankly, that is a small proportion.

And by the way, rightly so, we believe in decentralization on this show. And we believe above all in people power.

It's time to use it over this schools fiasco.

If your child's school won't open this fall, demand your money back so you can find an alternative. It's your child. It's your tax dollars.

Michael Hollan,Michelin starred chef goes viral after passionately complaining about 'the worst kind of guest',"A reservation isn’t just a dinner date, it’s a commitment.

A popular chef took to Instagram to complain about people making reservations at his restaurant and then not showing up. The post referred to these no-shows as “the worst kind of guest.”

Michelin-starred chef Tom Kerridge, head chef at Kerridge’s Bar & Grill in London, posted the emotional message to his Instagram account after 27 people failed to show up for their Saturday night reservations. According to him, this had serious consequences for his business, which is already struggling (like many other restaurants) due to the coronavirus pandemic.

MAN BITES SEAGULL AFTER IT TRIED TO STEAL HIS MCDONALD'S FOOD: REPORT

“To the 27 people that booked Kerridge’s Bar and Grill and then failed to turn up on a Saturday night,” he wrote, “this industry, like many others is on the verge of collapse. Your behavior is disgraceful, shortsighted and downright unhelpful.”

He continued, “All of you ‘no shows’ in all restaurants up and down the country are adding to the issues already being faced. You are putting people’s jobs more at risk. We put staff levels to the number of covers booked and when you fail to turn up, it now costs us, which in turn will force very uncomfortable and hard decisions about staffing levels.”

The post concluded, “You are the worst kind of guest, and that is ‘selfish.’ I hope you have good look at yourselves.”

Instagram users were seemingly sympathetic to the chef’s situation, as the post received over 29,000 likes.

Fellow chef Clare Smyth responded, “Well said Tom. We need to educate people now more than ever. Our industry needs to come into line with others.

Andy Puzder,Andy Puzder: Signs of a 'V'-shaped recovery — a welcome bounce back in economy,"The early economic signs indicate that we may already be in a “V”-shaped recovery — or at the very least a strong checkmark-shaped recovery — as we cautiously emerge from the coronavirus shutdown.

As Federal Reserve Bank Chairman Jay Powell admitted earlier this week, we have experienced a welcome “bounce back in economic activity,” and “have done so sooner than expected.” The economic data from the past two months make the point.

The May jobs report gave us the first indication that the post-pandemic rebound would be something special, revealing that employers had created a record-shattering 2.5 million jobs in a single month, beating economists' expectations for a loss of around 9 million jobs.

SEN. RICK SCOTT: CORONAVIRUS MANDATES – AMERICANS WILL MAKE THE RIGHT DECISIONS IF GIVEN MORE INFORMATION

Most economists anticipated that the trend would continue, but few foresaw just how stellar the June jobs report turned out to be. Last month, the country gained a mind-boggling 4.8 million new jobs, blowing past consensus expectations of around 3.7 million. As an added bonus, last month’s total was revised upward by nearly 200,000 jobs, bring the two-month gain to 7.5 million jobs.

Even though the labor force participation rate rose sharply, meaning more people began looking for work, the nationwide unemployment rate nonetheless plummeted in June by more than two full percentage points, falling from 13.3 percent to 11.1 percent, also beating economists’ expectations of a 0.8 of a percentage point decrease to 12.5 percent.

Those are some incredible numbers! But what else were we seeing in the economy?

In May, retail sales increased by a record 17.7 percent, soundly beating economists’ expectations of around 8.4 percent. This increase in retail sales — following three months of declines — bodes well for a return to positive economic growth. Consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of our economic output, and retail sales account for about a quarter of consumer spending.

New home sales, a leading indicator of housing market health, were up 16.6 percent in May, beating economists’ expectations of a 1.9 percent increase — with many economists having forecasted negative sales in May.

The renaissance is taking place across the board as state and local officials roll back their lockdown orders.

The National Association of Realtors recently reported that its index of pending home sales, a forward-looking indicator based on contract signings, rebounded by a record-setting 44.3 percent in May, driving the index to 99.6, the highest month-over-month gain since its inception in January 2001.

So how about June? It’s obviously early, but we have some data in addition to the jobs numbers.

Manufacturing, which represents about 11 percent of the U.S. economy, saw a big positive jump in June for the second straight month. The Institute for Supply Manufacturing survey showed that 52.6 percent of companies said their businesses are growing, up from 43.1 percent in May. That’s the best score since April of 2019 — and, of course, it beat economists’ expectations of 49.5 percent.

Consumers saw the writing on the wall in June even if the economists missed it — again. The Conference Board, a New York-based research organization, said that its Consumer Confidence Index rose to 98.1 in June from 85.9 in May, the biggest jump since 2011 and beating economists’ expectations of 90.5.

Not wanting to miss out on all the positivity, the stock markets — which are forward-looking — closed up nearly 20 percent for the quarter ending June 30, their best quarterly percentage increase since 1998.

Bottom line: the economic improvements over the past two months have been tremendous.

The renaissance is taking place across the board as state and local officials roll back their lockdown orders, though the gains are naturally being led by industries that were hit hardest by the pandemic, including leisure and hospitality (2.1 million new jobs), retail (740,000 new jobs), education and health services (568,000 new jobs), and manufacturing (356,000 new jobs).

There are plenty of lockdown orders still in place all over the country, meaning we’ve got ample potential for additional growth just by continuing to responsibly return to normal, even if we occasionally need to douse the embers of the pandemic here and there.

This unprecedented “V”-shaped recovery is exactly what President Trump predicted at the height of the COVID-19 downturn. Based on his track record of presiding over record-setting economic prosperity before the foreign pandemic reached our shores, I’ve always had confidence in the president’s ability to guide us through this crisis.

Now that the bounce-back has begun, I’m excited to see how his pro-growth economic agenda of middle-income tax cuts, targeted deregulation and genuinely free trade will fuel our national resurgence.

The “V”-shaped economic recovery has only just begun, and while there may be some coronavirus flare-ups along the way that force us to slow things down, we’ll have nothing to worry about as long as we keep President Trump’s pro-growth economic policies in place.

Yael Halon,Real estate CEO predicts future of remote working in NYC: 'Maybe workers go in once or twice a week',"Real estate entrepreneur Don Peebles predicted on ""Your World"" Monday that New York City-based companies are likely to reduce brick-and-mortar office space in favor of remote working, dealing a further blow to a market reeling from the coronavirus pandemic.

""Office space consumption was already on the decline,"" Peebles told host Neil Cavuto.

CORONAVIRUS LEADS TO NYC REAL ESTATE POUNDING

""What happened with COVID-19 is, it accelerated nationally ... because it compelled most Americans, certainly office workers, to work remotely. What business owners, entrepreneurs, and CEOs found out is that it was an effective way to work.""

Approximately 300,000 New Yorkers returned to work Monday as the city moved to Phase 2 of its reopening strategy, but Peebles said it would be only a matter of time before employees see a ""significant decline"" in office space.

""Now people can work from all over the world and they don't have to be in the same geographic location of where their job is located,"" he explained. ""That will open up [a] greater talent pool for businesses to make it more cost-effective.

""I think that there is a difference coming and the CEOs who are questioning that are right on point,"" he added.

While experts were hopeful that the real estate market would bounce back as the city moved toward a full reopening, Peebles said many are now hesitant to return due to a troubling uptick in violent crime and murder rates in recent weeks.

Louis Casiano,New coronavirus map shows more than half of all states are 'trending poorly' or have 'uncontrolled spread',"A new map highlighting the spread of the coronavirus shows more than half of all states ""trending poorly"" or facing an ""uncontrolled spread"" as COVID-19 continues to make a resurgence in the United States.

Created by covidexitstrategy.org, the map tracks each state's coronavirus response based on a set of criteria provided by the White House that specifies what each state and region must accomplish before moving forward with plans to reopening their economies.

The map measures and scores each state based on the number of positive cases over a 14-day period using a 7-day rolling average, bed capacity at hospitals and intensive care units and positivity rates.

According to the figure, New York, once the epicenter of the virus, is trending for the better while nearly all Southern and some Midwestern states are faring far worse. New York recorded a 1 percent positivity rate over the past 14 days, following weeks of lockdown measures.

California is listed with an ""uncontrolled spread"" with 219 cases per every million people. The state has seen significant gains erased as infections continue to climb, forcing Gov. Gavin Newsom re-impose restrictions and business closures.

Texas, Florida and Georgia are also seeing giant upticks in COVID-19 cases. Texas and Florida engaged in some of the most aggressive reopenings among states and have since enacted restriction measures to combat the disease's spread.

Florida recorded a nearly 19 percent positivity rate, up from 15.6 percent two weeks ago.

The only states trending for the better are New York, Massachusetts, Maine -- with a .0 percent positivity rate -- and New Jersey. Around 16 states, including Pennslyvania, Illinois and Washington, are in limbo with caution being warranted if the number of cases increases.

As of Monday night, the U.S. reported more than 3.3 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and over 135,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University.

Ritu Prasad,Coronavirus: How did Florida get so badly hit by Covid-19?,"Image copyright Getty Images

Florida is fast becoming America's latest Covid-19 epicentre. The surge in the Sunshine State has been linked in part to younger Americans - but that doesn't mean there's no cause for concern.

Like many Covid-19 stories, it started with a dry cough.

Fever, loss of taste and chest pain followed Sanjay Bharath's diagnosis in early March.

Mr Bharath, who is a hospital nurse in South Florida, says he caught the virus from a patient when the Covid-19 screening process for admissions was less strict. He was told to self-quarantine two days later.

At 34 years old, Mr Bharath does not fall into a virus-vulnerable age group. But 14 days after that first contact, he had coughed up blood and checked into the hospital.

Two days later, on 26 March, he was intubated.

""I didn't think it was too bad,"" he says, describing his first couple of hours in the ER. ""I honestly thought they weren't going to admit me at the hospital, just send me home with some sort of medication.""

As his symptoms worsened, Mr Bharath says he would wake up in a fever-sweat every six hours, feeling chills and lightheaded and unable to catch his breath.

""I couldn't take a big breath without coughing and choking,"" he says. ""It's like you're running a marathon constantly just by sitting down.""

Mr Bharath would remain on a ventilator for eight days.

Florida has been averaging nearly 10,000 new cases per day for the last week. On 12 July, the state broke the national record by reporting 15,300 cases in a single day. A Reuters analysis on 12 July found if Florida were a country, it would be fourth in the world for most new cases in a day.

As of 13 July, over 4,200 Floridians have died due to the virus and the state's weekly average has risen to 73 people each day by local counts.

Florida saw the biggest daily jump in hospital admissions on 9 July, with more than 400 patients needing treatment. The same day saw the state's all-time highest daily death toll, with 120 residents, including an 11-year-old girl, dying due to the virus.

Critics say the number of deaths is probably higher, as Florida does not like other states report deaths suspected as having been caused by Covid-19. The state also has yet to report daily hospital admission rates, though officials have promised to do so.

Along with Texas and Arizona, the Sunshine State has fast become one of the regions with the highest surges in the country.

The positive test rate - which indicates how much the virus is spreading even with testing increases - is nearing 20%, the highest since early March when the pandemic hit the US. That's also four times the standard for reopening set by the World Health Organization, and double the recommendation by the Centers for Disease Control.

Florida only hit the 100,000 case mark on 22 June, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Just 13 days later, that number had doubled.

Now, there are more than 278,000 cases.

""There's a lot of misinformation all over the web about the seriousness of this outbreak,"" says Dr Aileen Marty, a Florida International University infectious disease expert who has been working with state officials on the pandemic response. She says this is partly why Florida is now among the worst-hit regions.

""Since we don't have a consistent message in our state, let alone our country, there's even more confusion.""

In May and June, Governor Ron DeSantis had said reopening was feasible as cases had declined. He promised no roll-backs.

As cases began rising, Mr DeSantis in June reversed his decision to allow bars to reopen. But he has refused to require masks statewide, though local leaders in major cities like Miami have done so, and has joined President Donald Trump in emphasising the importance of keeping the economy open.

""The way that we've acted after our initial lockdowns has perpetuated the problem,"" Dr Marty says. ""It was a failure because they didn't do it right the first time.""

Dr Marty, who also serves as a World Health Organization adviser, says establishing a contact tracing and isolating system while the state was in lockdown was one key step that never happened.

A lack of early testing of asymptomatic individuals plus weeks of civil unrest, between anti-lockdown protesters and marches against racial inequality, have also worsened the situation.

But even as Florida's numbers continue to trend upwards, Mr DeSantis said last week he felt the state's numbers had stabilised, telling residents: ""There's no need to be fearful.""

The Republican governor has also downplayed the severity of Florida's outbreak by pointing to the increase in testing and younger Floridians being infected - particularly those aged 25 to 34 - as well as a lower death rate.

""Generally, deaths follow about two weeks behind when we get the positive tests,"" Dr Marty explains. She pushes back against the notion that America is doing well with deaths from this virus, saying even looking at just the raw data shows the nationwide rate - around 5.6% - is concerning.

""That's considering the fact that we're better at it now than we were,"" she adds. ""We're getting people in beds sooner, moving people to ICUs sooner.""

Testing, despite delays in getting results, has also aided mitigation. Medication is helping, though Florida has run out of the Remdesivir antiviral drug and is awaiting new shipments.

""I just don't understand people who say our death rate is great,"" Dr Marty says.

Younger Americans have been blamed for surges across the country, and particularly in Florida, where most new cases are from those under age 30 on the heels of summertime weather and national holidays.

The median age of infections in Miami-Dade County, the state's most populous region, is 40. In Tallahassee, the median recently hit a low of 25 years old.

But just because younger people are less likely to die than the elderly from this disease does not make this surge less worrying. Health experts warn there are still serious risks and far too many unknowns about what contracting Covid-19 means in the long-term.

Recent studies have found that some asymptomatic survivors lost some of their sense of smell, even if they did not notice a change. In scans, individuals who otherwise feel fine show signs of lung damage.

""There is a risk to [young people] now, which is small, and a risk for their future, which is unknown,"" Dr Marty says.

In hospital, Dr Marty has seen Covid patients develop clots that lead to strokes. Some clots lead to losing limbs. Others develop an inflammation of the heart. All this in addition to the damage to the lungs - the scarring they will feel the effects of for the rest of their lives.

In the last week alone she has cared for patients ranging from 30 to 80 years old.

""It's not one and done with this thing,"" she emphasises.

There are questions when it comes to herd immunity as well - with no proof yet that it works with this virus. Data from the six other coronaviruses that have caused infections in humans suggests none of them produce immunity lasting more than a year.

Mr Bharath was one of the first staff in his hospital to catch Covid-19, back in March.

After being taken off the ventilator, the 34-year-old was moved from the ICU to recover for four days in a Covid-19-only unit - the same unit where he works now. No visitors were allowed in at all, even family.

""The recovery was a little difficult at first,"" Mr Bharath says. ""I was still really out of breath, I still had some pneumonia. It was still difficult breathing and moving around.""

In the two weeks in hospital over Covid-19, Mr Bharath lost 20 lbs (9kg). Lying still in a hospital bed exacerbated a prior nerve issue in his feet - he lost some feeling in his toes while other tendons had stiffened up painfully. He was out of work for another six weeks.

Now, four months since his hospital stay, Mr Bharath is still recovering. ""I still get short of breath a bit here and there,"" he says.

When he returned to work at the start of June, he says he ""hesitated a little bit"".

""But I felt like I owed the staff and the employees, and there's still a job to be done, so I had to go back.""

The never-ending work is beginning to take a toll on healthcare workers across the state. Staff are exhausted, frustrated, scared.

As of 13 July, there are just over 13,700 hospital beds - about 22% of the total - still available in the state, according to data from the Agency for Health Care Administration. Nearly half of all the ICUs in the state report being at least 90% full, leaving under 1,200 beds available. Over 40 hospitals are already at capacity.

""There's a limited number of trained and ready professionals,"" Dr Marty says. ""We're talking about doctors, we're talking about nurses, we're talking about aides of all kinds - that know how to even use the kind of equipment that we need to use. A brain surgeon has no idea how to use a ventilator.""

Florida will be importing over 100 nurses in the next few days, and it seems likely the state will need to import doctors as well. Personal protective equipment - essential for keeping staff safe and containing the virus' spread in care settings - is also running low again.

""We're stressed out,"" Dr Marty says. ""Nurses are coming to me because they're being told to wear surgical masks instead of N95s because we don't have N95s.""

Testing continues to be America's ever-present problem. Without it, keeping Covid-19 contained is a shot in the dark.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Testing sites have seen long wait times and delays in results

The US had begun to ramp up testing capacity, but demands now are threatening to overwhelm labs in Florida and nationwide. Machines are not able to keep up with the surge in tests, resulting in delays that in turn fuel community spread as people do not know if they're positive for days.

Mr Bharath says it's frustrating to see people continue to refuse to wear masks and deny that Florida's recent surge stemmed from its push to reopen.

""They're putting a lot of people at risk,"" he says, adding that there's always the fear that he might catch it again or bring it home to more vulnerable family members.

""The weird thing about this virus is it affects a lot of people differently,"" Mr Bharath says.

Simon Read,Ocado says switch to online shopping is permanent,"Image copyright PAUL ELLIS/AFP VIA GETTY IMAGES

Online grocer Ocado says the switch to internet shopping amid the coronavirus lockdown has led to a ""permanent redrawing"" of the retail landscape.

Its comments came as it said sales during the first half of 2020 jumped 27% to more than £1bn.

""The world as we know it has changed,"" said chief executive Tim Steiner.

""As a result of Covid-19, we have seen years of growth in the online grocery market condensed into a matter of months; and we won't be going back.""

""We are confident that accelerated growth in the online channel will continue, leading to a permanent redrawing of the landscape of the grocery industry worldwide.""

He said Ocado was now the fastest growing grocer in the UK, thanks to a 50/50 partnership with Marks and Spencer announced last year.

As part of the deal, which saw M&S take a half-share in Ocado's retail business, Ocado will start delivering M&S grocery products from September, when its current deal with Waitrose expires.

The group reported a loss before tax of £40.6m in the six months to the end of May, blaming an increase in investment to handle the higher demand generated as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.

During the period the company opened its first two customer fulfilment centres abroad, for Casino in France and Sobeys in Canada, while increasing capacity in the UK.

The loss was smaller than the £147.4m posted in the same period last year, although that figure included £99m of costs incurred as a result of a major fire at its warehouse in Andover.

But after raising £1bn through an equity and bond issue last month, Ocado said it had £2.3bn in cash on its balance sheet.

""There is evidence to suggest many shoppers will likely continue buying their groceries online once lockdown measures have been lifted completely, but it will be difficult for Ocado to maintain the sales registered at the peak of the crisis,"" said John Moore, senior investment manager at Brewin Dolphin.

""Nevertheless, Ocado has a strong balance sheet and the Covid-19 pandemic has super-accelerated many of the trends that have led to its exceptional share price growth over the last few years, placing the company in a good position for the future.""

By the end of 2023 it plans another 100 stores across Britain, creating 4,000 more jobs, and bringing its total number of shops to 1,000.

""It is testament to the continued hard work of our colleagues that we are able to continue forging ahead with our expansion plans, despite the challenging circumstances that have been faced over the past months,"" said Lidl GB boss Christian Härtnagel.

Jessica Bateman,The young people fighting the worst smog in Europe,"“We always knew there was a problem with pollution because we can see it,” says Kosta Barsov, who lives in Skopje, North Macedonia. “In winter it stinks – if I open my bedroom window while I’m studying it feels like I’m suffocating. If I go walk my dog, I have to change my clothes when I get back because they smell.

Every day in winter, 16-year-old Barsov opens the AirCare app on his phone and checks the pollution levels around him. “There are two sensors close to my house and it’s always really polluted in winter,” Barsov tells me. If he sees a green circle, the air around him is reasonably clean. If it’s yellow, there’s some pollution but it doesn’t break EU limits. If it’s red or darker, pollution is over the limit, and hazardous to health.

The app has become an essential tool to Barsov, and many others in the city, for understanding where the pollution is and exactly how bad it is. As a result, it has sparked growing awareness, and concern, about the city’s air.

“A lot of people use the app, my uncle has asthma and he’s always checking it,” says Barsov, who is a member of the local Fridays for Future chapter, a global youth movement for action on climate change. “There’s been a lot more awareness over the past few years, and I feel we’re building a movement.”

Standing on the touchline as her son played football, Louise Hill started moaning about how her kids' spending habits were spiralling out of control.

At the time her son was eight and her daughter was 11. Louise was so frustrated by how much they were buying online that she would pin Apple invoices to the fridge door to help her kids understand why their £4 a week pocket money was now just 50p.

The two other parents she was chatting to back in 2009 had similar stories, so the conversation really struck a chord. And inspired the beginning of a business.

""One of the dads started talking about how his son had bought something on eBay, the other how his daughter had spent £2,000 through PlayStation,"" says Louise, who is now 57. ""There were all sorts of stories. We thought, 'Surely someone needs to help parents with this?'""

That someone ended up being Louise and the two fathers, Mark Timbrell and Doug Mahy, who started meeting every Thursday night in a curry house in the town of Lymington, in the New Forest, on England's south coast, to pull together a business plan. Their idea was to create a prepaid debit card and app for six to 18-year-olds that would help children learn how to handle their own finances.

Kids would be able to use the card in physical shops or online, but they'd only be able to spend whatever money their parents had put on the card via the app.

Mums and dads could also use the app to keep a watchful eye on their children's spending or set limits, establish regular pocket money payments, or make one-off payments if the kids had done a certain task, such as wash the car.

The business would make its money by charging the parents a monthly fee per child, which currently stands at £2.99.

Louise, who previously worked in e-commerce, was confident that the idea would be a success. However, it took two years to raise the £700,000 required to launch the business, and plug into its banking partners - payments giant Visa, and bank IDT Finance.

""I can't tell you how many pitching sessions I went to,"" she says. ""But we managed to pull together a group of high net worth angel investors who were really excited about it, and clearly shared our vision.""

The business was originally called PKTMNY, standing for ""pocket money"", but the name was changed within the first year of trading as the company felt that the original moniker was difficult for people to search for.

GoHenry was chosen instead in honour of the firm's first customer, an 11-year-old boy called Henry.

To grow the business in its early days, Louise says they tried adverts on local radio, partnerships with schools, and attending summer fairs, such as the New Forest Show. A quarter of customers stemmed from recommendations from others.

Today the London-based company says that more than one million children have cards across the UK and US.

Louise says the app is designed to teach children to be ""savvy consumers"", and learn that ""money doesn't grow on trees"".

However, some parents have used review website Trustpilot to complain that GoHenry's monthly fee is too high. Rivals such as Nimbl and Osper are cheaper at £2.49 and £2.50 per child respectively.

""We have to charge something as we cannot afford not to,"" says Louise, who is the only founder left in the business, after the other two departed within the first two years to pursue other interests.

""We're not Barclays, and we need to cover our costs. £2.99 is not a huge amount. We keep it as low as we possibly can.""

Helen Saxon, banking editor at MoneySavingExpert.com, says that GoHenry is popular because of its functionality, such as parents being able to receive notifications on their mobile phone when their child's card is used.

Image copyright GoHenry Image caption Louise now has the chief operating officer job title

""[However], it does have similar competitors, most of which are a touch cheaper - Nimbl, Osper and Rooster Money - who all provide a similar service,"" says Ms Saxon.

""And none of these compare well [on cost terms] with High Street bank accounts for kids, which don't have fees, and often actually pay interest when there is money in them.""

She adds that most banks only offer accounts to children aged 11 and over though, which makes GoHenry very useful, because it is open to younger kids.

""If you're looking to teach your [young] child about how to handle money, these cards will help,"" says Ms Saxon.

More The Boss features:

GoHenry now has 150 staff across its three UK offices in London, Lymington and Farnborough, and its US base in New York.

The firm launched in the US in 2018, and is now focused on growing its market share in both countries. This expansion is being led by chief executive Alex Zivoder, a former director at ticket business Viagogo.

He was appointed by Louise in 2015, when she switched to the role of chief operating officer, so she could focus on ""day to day operations"". She remains a co-owner of the business.

""A good founder has the company's best interests at heart, and is constantly questioning what the company needs,"" says Louise. ""And sometimes that may not be you as chief executive.""

Louise's children, whose overspending inspired the creation of the business, are now 19 and 22. ""They are both confident with money,"" she says.",2020-07-14,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-53333347
Stav Dimitropoulos,Why Hollywood needs computer games tech more than ever,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The technology used in computer games is changing the way films are made, says Kim Libreri

Kim Libreri, an award-winning visual effects artist based in Northern California, has worked on movies including Artificial Intelligence and War of the Planet of the Apes.

For nine years he has been working with a piece of technology better known for computer games, in particular the smash-hit Fortnite.

The Unreal Engine, owned by Epic Games, provides the building blocks and tools that a computer game developer needs, but is increasingly an attractive technology for TV and film producers.

The latest version of technology, Unreal Engine 5, is coming out next year, and Epic has been heavily trailing its features.

It should allow visual effects artists like Mr Libreri to slot graphics and images straight into a scene, with little fuss.

""With traditional filmmaking, a director and cinematographer might shoot a scene on set -then down the line, hand footage and creative direction off to a team of virtual reality artists and designers, who enhance that material with visual effects and computer-generated imagery in a separate phase of production, says Mr Libreri, who is now chief technology officer at Epic Games.

Image copyright Epic Games Image caption Directors can play with lighting and other effects inside a games engine

With Unreal Engine collaboration between the director, cinematographer, production designer and virtual reality teams can occur simultaneously as an interactive process on set.

""Unreal Engine 5 promises to further free the artistic process by making it easier to take virtual worlds developed for feature film and television, and run them in the game engine in real time,"" says Mr Libreri.

Anthony Hunt, is the chief executive of Cinesite, a multinational digital entertainment group, whose visual effects film work includes blockbusters such as Avengers: Endgame, Independence Day: Resurgence, Iron Man 3 and more.

More Technology of Business

His company recently used Unreal Engine on a live stunt show for a theme park, which includes chase scenes, punishing fistfights, and death-defying leaps.

""It all happens right in front of you with live performers, interactive props and an immense LED screen - making it impossible to determine where the live-action ends and the screen begins,"" says Mr Hunt.

The film industry has long borrowed tech from the computer games industry.

Games production processes like mapping out scenes in 3D through photography, storyboards and animatics run on similar systems to those used to build games.

But the challenges of producing films and television under lockdown restrictions is likely to accelerate the use of games technology.

Image copyright PARAMOUNT PICTURES Image caption Dodger Stadium was recreated for Rocketman

For example game engines are particularly good for generating big crowd scenes.

""An extra has to be fed and clothed and housed on a film set. We can replicate huge crowd scenes with computer technology now and just have our main actors in the foreground,"" says Mr Hunt.

A good example of this a scene in Rocketman, the musical fantasy about Elton John's breakthrough years.

One scene was set in Dodger Stadium, but in reality actor Taron Egerton performed the scene at Shepperton Studios. The crowds used were 3D graphics designed to be parts of a larger scene.

Computer-generated scenery can be combined with LED walls - giant screens made up of individual displays.

""LED walls are becoming more popular in film and television production because they allow filmmakers to capture visual effects in camera, and manipulate digital objects in a scene in real time,"" says Mr Libreri.

""LED panels as those we've seen with Disney's The Mandalorian (a science fiction TV series and part of the Star Wars family) will be a huge benefit to on-set production once restrictions start to lift, as filmmakers can reduce travel by creating photorealistic digital backgrounds to mimic any location,"" he continues.

Image copyright Disney/Lucasfilms Image caption Disney's Mandalorian used a games engine and LED walls

""When the physical filming restrictions are lifted, directors will have a clear plan of what and how to shoot their film/TV series because they will have done so in the computer already,"" says Mr Hunt.

What will all this mean to the actors, crew and support staff who work in the industry?

""There is a possibility that production crew needs will alter somewhat. Some roles may change with the ongoing use of CGI, perhaps other roles will be created,"" Daniel Green, director of the Master of Entertainment Industry Management Program at Carnegie Mellon University says.

When production returns to normal, the industry will need to be unified and make changes to assure that safety is paramount says Dr Green.

Studio executives and producers will no longer be making decisions solely based on artistic vision and production costs.

""They will now be in close consultation with public health officials to make sure that crews, actors, and staff can have a work environment that is safe and secure,"" he says.

Mr Green also points out that CGI creates realistic worlds which are fun, but good story-telling is still the key.

""The use of CGI and virtual production as in The Lion King remake can augment what can be shown on the screen, but at the end of the day, audiences are still going to want to be entertained by a story that captivates them.""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption James Dean on the set of Giant

Travis Cloyd, chief technology officer of CMG Worldwide, a company that represents 1,700 celebrities, athletes, musicians, brands and historical figures, sees another use for games engines.

A great business opportunity lies in ""resurrecting"" historical figures and famous people of the past like James Dean or Rosa Parks via digital twins, according to Mr Cloyd.

""These famous people have a prebuilt awareness,"" he says. ""They will always resonate with the audiences and the expansion of new platforms amidst the pandemic will bring new opportunities to use them in a plethora of media,"" Mr Cloyd says.

Technology like the Unreal Engine is likely to be used in that process.

Movie making is of course a business, so the hope will be that new technology will save time and money.

""Fewer things will need to be worked out on set and in post-production, and there will be less need for travel and expensive location shoots,"" says Mr Libreri.

""Once people experience this new way of working,"" Mr Libreri continues, ""they will find that it is much more efficient and cost-effective"".

""It is safe to say that virtual production is here to stay,"" he says.",2020-07-14,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51799504
Jonathan Amos,'Hope' and ambition drive UAE's Mars mission,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The woman leading UAE's mission to Mars

The United Arab Emirates will despatch a satellite to Mars to study its weather and climate this week.

Hope, as the 1.3-tonne probe is called, is launching on an H-2A rocket from Japan's remote Tanegashima spaceport.

The 500-million-km journey should see the robotic craft arrive in February 2021 - in time for the 50th anniversary of the UAE's formation.

Lift-off is scheduled for 05:43 local time on Friday (20:43 GMT; 21:43 BST on Thursday).

An earlier attempt on Wednesday was called off ahead of time because of expected poor weather conditions over Tanegashima.

Hope is one of three missions launching to Mars this month. The US and China both have surface rovers in the late stages of preparation.

Image copyright MBRSC Image caption Robotic probe: Hope has taken six years to develop

Why is the UAE going to Mars?

The UAE has limited experience of designing and manufacturing spacecraft - and yet here it is attempting something only the US, Russia, Europe and India have succeeded in doing. But it speaks to the Emiratis' ambition that they should dare to take on this challenge.

Their engineers, mentored by American experts, have produced a sophisticated probe in just six years - and when this satellite gets to Mars, it's expected to deliver novel science, revealing fresh insights on the workings of the planet's atmosphere.

In particular, scientists think it can add to our understanding of how Mars lost much of its air and with it a great deal of its water.

The Hope probe is regarded very much as a vehicle for inspiration - something that will attract more young people in the Emirates and across the Arab region to take up the sciences in school and in higher education.

The satellite is one of a number of projects the UAE government says signals its intention to move the country away from a dependence on oil and gas and towards a future based on a knowledge economy.

But as ever when it comes to Mars, the risks are high. A half of all missions sent to the Red Planet have ended in failure. Hope project director, Omran Sharif, recognises the dangers but insists his country is right to try.

""This is a research and development mission and, yes, failure is an option,"" he told BBC News.

""However, failure to progress as a nation is not an option. And what matters the most here is the capacity and the capability that the UAE gained out of this mission, and the knowledge it brought into the country.""

Image copyright MBRSC Image caption The Hope probe will study Mars' atmosphere from bottom to top

How has the UAE managed to do this?

The UAE government told the project team it couldn't purchase the spacecraft from a big, foreign corporation; it had to build the satellite itself.

This meant going into partnership with American universities that had the necessary experience. Emirati and US engineers and scientists worked alongside each other to design and build the spacecraft systems and the three onboard instruments that will study the planet.

While much of the satellite's fabrication occurred at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP) at the University of Colorado, Boulder, considerable work was also undertaken at the Mohammed Bin Rashid Space Centre (MBRSC) in Dubai.

LASP senior systems engineer Brett Landin believes the Emiratis are now in a great place to do another mission on their own.

""It's one thing to tell somebody how to ride a bike but until you've done it, you don't really understand what it's like. Well, it's the same with a spacecraft. I could give you the process for fuelling a spacecraft, but until you've put on an escape suit and transferred 800kg of highly volatile rocket fuel from storage tanks into the spacecraft, you don't really know what it's like.

""Their propulsion engineers have now done it and they know how to do it the next time they build a spacecraft.""

Image copyright ESA/DLR/FU Berlin Image caption Surface features indicate Mars once had abundant flowing water

What science will Hope do at Mars?

The Emiratis didn't want to do ""me too"" science; they didn't want to turn up at the Red Planet and repeat measurements that had already been made by others. So they went to a US space agency (Nasa) advisory committee called the Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group (MEPAG) and asked what research a UAE probe could usefully add to the current state of knowledge.

MEPAG's recommendations framed Hope's objectives. In one line, the UAE satellite is going to study how energy moves through the atmosphere - from the top to the bottom, at all times of day, and through all the seasons of the year.

It will track features such as lofted dust which on Mars hugely influences the temperature of the atmosphere.

It will also look at what's happening with the behaviour of neutral atoms of hydrogen and oxygen right at the top of the atmosphere. There's a suspicion these atoms play a significant role in the ongoing erosion of Mars' atmosphere by the energetic particles that stream away from the Sun.

This plays into the story of why the planet is now missing most of the water it clearly had early in its history.

To gather its observations, Hope will take up a near-equatorial orbit that stands off from the planet at a distance of 22,000km to 44,000km.

""The desire to see every piece of real estate at every time of day ended up making the orbit very large and elliptical,"" explained core science team lead on Hope, David Brain from LASP.

""By making those choices, we will for example be able to hover over Olympus Mons (the largest volcano in the Solar System) as Olympus Mons moves through different times of day. And at other times, we'll be letting Mars spin underneath us.

""We'll get full disc images of Mars, but our camera has filters, so we'll be doing science with those images - getting global views with different goggles on, if you like.""

Image copyright MBRSC Image caption Sarah Al Amiri is also a minister in the government

Who is Sarah Al Amiri?

The science lead on Hope is also the UAE minister of state for advanced sciences - and in many ways is the face of this mission.

She first got involved with the MBRSC as a software engineer and is now trying to spread her passion for space far and wide.

It's notable that 34% of Emiratis working on Hope are women. ""But more importantly, we have gender parity in the leadership team of this mission, across all deputy project manger roles reporting to Omran,"" the minister said.

Anthony Zurcher,Coronavirus: Things US has got wrong,"Image copyright Getty Images

So much for a summer lull in the coronavirus pandemic. Instead, the US has seen a resurgence of the disease in numerous states, particularly across the south and west.

The US nation as a whole has topped 60,000 recorded daily new cases this week.

Did it have to be this way, though?

Other industrialised nations, in Europe and Asia, pursued more rigorous mitigation plans, ramped up testing and contact tracing earlier, and eased restrictions in a slower and more co-ordinated fashion.

They have not, at least so far, seen a resurgence of the virus similar to the one the US is currently experiencing.

The US state of Arizona, for instance, is currently registering as many new cases of coronavirus as the entire European Union, which has a population 60 times greater.

It makes for a gloomy review of what's gone right and (mostly) wrong, as the US enters its fifth full month of a pandemic that has no end in sight.

WHAT'S GONE WRONG

States opened too quickly

A month ago, the coronavirus numbers in the US appeared, at the very least, stable. The spread of the disease had been slowed, as the daily tally of new cases plateaued.

That prompted a number of states - including Texas, California, Florida and Arizona - to move forward with plans to ease off public shelter-in-place and business closure orders.

Many of these states moved ahead despite not hitting the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended benchmarks for doing so, such as a 14-day drop in cases and less than 5% of tests coming back positive for the virus.

It turns out, the overall national numbers were misleading, as states that were hit hard early, such as New York and New Jersey, were experiencing declines, while numbers in other states were beginning to inch up.

They're not inching up anymore, they're surging - and the worst, as far as hospitalisations and fatalities, could be yet to come.

Now Texas, California and Arizona, among others, have re-imposed business closure orders and mandated mask-wearing, which has been determined to reduce the spread of the virus. It may be too little to avoid another public-health crisis, however.

""We opened way too early in Arizona,"" Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego, a Democrat, said in recent television interview. ""We were one of the last states to go to stay-at-home and one of the first to re-emerge.""

The 8,181 Covid-19 hospitalisations in Texas on Sunday were yet another record high. In Arizona, 14% of coronavirus tests are positive for the virus.

California, an early success story in limiting the spread of the virus, has seen a 90% increase in cases over the past two weeks, after the state in May allowed local authorities more discretion in businesses re-openings.

The surge in cases is also again leading to delays and shortages in testing - an area that had appeared to be a strength for the US after a halting start.

Without adequate testing, it will be significantly more difficult to identify and isolate new cases and locations where the virus is spreading unchecked.

""We're right back where we were at the peak of the epidemic during the New York outbreak,"" former Food and Drug Administration commissioner Scott Gottlieb said during a television interview on Sunday.

At least for the moment, the rate of daily deaths has not reached New York levels - but that may only be a matter of time, as the current cases progress.

""It is already too late,"" says Luiza Petre, a New York City physician and professor of cardiology at the Mt Sinai School of Medicine. ""We're at a point of no return where it will be very, very difficult to restrain this pandemic.""

Mask-wearing became partisan

Compounding the decision by some states to prioritise reopening in spite of warnings from public-health officials, one of the best methods of limiting the spread of the virus - wearing a face covering - has become mired in partisan acrimony.

A June survey by Pew Research Center found that only 49% of conservative Republicans said they wore a mask most of the time in the past month, while that number is 83% among liberal Democrats.

Conservative opposition becomes even more entrenched at the prospect of government-enforced mask mandates.

""Kansans don't need Laura Kelly and the nanny state making decisions best left to individuals,"" Bill Clifford, a Republican congressional candidate in Kansas, said in response to a mask order from his state's Democratic governor. ""State mask mandates violate the principles of individual liberty and local control upon which America was founded.""

Donald Trump himself has contributed to the division, mocking a reporter who refused to remove his mask during a press conference as being ""politically correct"" and retweeting a Fox News journalist who suggested a photo of Joe Biden in a mask was damaging to the Democrat's image.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Few Trump supporters wore masks at his Tulsa rally

The president has steadfastly refused to wear a mask in public events - a position that has clearly registered with his supporters. At the president's campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in June, few in the crowd chose to use face-coverings, and most disregarded social-distancing suggestions.

Public-health officials aren't free from blame, either. Early on, they declared that face-coverings were only helpful for front-line medical personnel.

While the real motivation for such statements may have been to reserve limited supplies to those most in need, the end result was a message that was muddled and shifted as the pandemic progressed.

Public complacency

While some state governments have eased restrictions on public gatherings and allowed businesses to re-open, they have frequently accompanied such moves with recommendations that individuals make decisions based on medical advice and common sense.

Those recommendations have been, to put it mildly, not always heeded.

Summer holidays led to mask-less crowds in reopened bars and restaurants, public parks and beaches. And while masks were a fairly common sight during the mass anti-discrimination protests that swept the nation in the past month, social-distancing practices were essentially non-existent.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Can you become immune to coronavirus?

The numbers behind this new coronavirus surge indicates that many of the newly infected are younger Americans, who have been among the quickest to return to in-personal socialising. Some political leaders, including the president, have essentially encouraged this, asserting that the young and healthy have little to fear from the virus.

""Now we have tested over 40 million people,"" Trump tweeted on Saturday. ""But by so doing, we show cases, 99% of which are totally harmless.""

That flies in the face of public-health studies that have shown that a fifth of Covid-19 cases result in severe respiratory distress.

""We have data in the White House task force,"" US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn on Sunday, refusing to reject Trump's 99% figure as false. ""Those data show us that this is a serious problem. People need to take it seriously.""

But a president downplaying the severity of the disease can go a long way toward undermining words of warning from his subordinates.

Education approaching crisis

The coronavirus resurgence has also lit the fuse on a bomb that is set to explode in just a few months. September is when American children traditionally head back to classrooms across the nation, and it's becoming clear that nothing close to a normal educational experience is waiting for them.

School administrators are starting to unveil their plans for the coming academic year, and in many cases it's a blend of in-person and distance learning with the hope that it's enough to keep their institutions from becoming staging grounds for spreading the pandemic.

Already some teachers' unions are rebelling at the suggestion that educators - including elderly or those at greater health risk - return to classrooms with what they view as insufficient protection or preparation.

""Our educators are overwhelmingly not comfortable returning to schools,"" wrote the head of a Washington DC area teachers' union. ""They fear for their lives, the lives of students and the lives of their families.""

Meanwhile, parents facing the prospect of having to manage more de-facto home-schooling and figuring out how to care for and supervise their children while they, themselves, are being asked to return to their workplaces.

Trump, despite campaigning in 2016 against federal involvement in local education systems, is already pressuring schools to open back up on time. He's called for the CDC to revise its guidance to make it easier to reopen school buildings and threatened to cut off federal funds for those that don't comply.

Florida, a Republican-controlled state currently in the midst of a widespread coronavirus outbreak, already has ordered its schools to open for classes at the end of August.

The president's rhetoric, delivered via Twitter, seems destined to politicise yet another aspect of the coronavirus response, again putting local officials in the unenvious position of balancing community health concerns with demands to return to normal times that seem increasingly out of reach.

WHAT'S GONE RIGHT

New York recovery

Although the coronavirus situation in many US states in the south and west has become increasingly dire, what was once the epicentre of the outbreak - New York - has made remarkable improvements.

Daily deaths, which peaked on 8 April at 799, have dropped to single digits. Only 1.38% of the state's coronavirus testing last Friday returned positive results.

As other areas have re-imposed lockdown restrictions, New York has begun reopening many public facilities and private business such as salons, tattoo shops and youth sport leagues. Indoor restaurants, however, remain closed.

""What happened in New York should have been a cautionary tale for the other states to pay attention and learn to create a more centralised strategy,"" says Ms Petre, the New York City cardiologist. ""New York is a success story.""

As the state continues to ease its mitigation restrictions, there is the risk that the virus will return resurgent.

""We've been through hell and back, but this is not over,"" said New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. ""This can still rear its ugly head anywhere in this nation and in this state.""

Economy stabilised - for now

A funny thing happened on the way to the next Great Depression. The US economy, expected by many forecasters to be in a devastating tailspin, stabilised and began to improve.

May unemployment figures, predicted to top 20%, registered at 13.3% instead. Then, in June, they ticked down to 11.4% - an indication that the workplace haemorrhaging had been stopped much earlier than expected.

Meanwhile, key stock indices have bounced back from their late winter beating. By 2 July, the Dow Jones Industrial Index had recovered 66% of its losses from its February record high. The Standards & Poor's 500 Index, a broader measure of stocks, has made up 77% of its losses this year.

What Anthony wrote in April and May

Other economic indicators offer similar signs of an economic resurgence.

The strength of the recovery has largely been attributed to the push by states to quickly lift virus mitigation orders and federal action to provide economic support for businesses and individuals hit hardest by the virus.

The return of business closures in several states could mean the economic good news will be short-lived.

Meanwhile, most of the stimulus measures passed by Congress have either run their course or are set to expire soon, while there appears little prospect of further action.

""Since it is now clear that the effects of this crisis will be felt at least until the end of 2020, that relief package will not be enough,"" says Jill Gonzales, an analyst with the personal finance website Wallethub.

Science advancing

While the coronavirus afflicts a growing number of US states, the American medical community continues to grind away at treatments and, ultimately, a vaccine.

Remdesivir, an antiviral drug, has shown promise in limiting the severity of the disease in hospitalised patients (prompting the US government to strike a deal with the drug's manufacturer to prioritise American patients).

A new study indicates that the commonly available steroid dexamethasone cut the risk of death for coronavirus patients on ventilators by a third.

There are also ""encouraging signs"" from experts that the use of blood plasma from recovered Covid-19 patients could help those currently suffering from the disease, although clinical research is ongoing.

""Medicine has evolved at lightning speed,"" says Ms Petre. ""The government has teamed up with pharmaceutical companies and a lot has been done, which is good""

On the vaccine front, there are now several pharmaceutical companies reporting positive results from early tests on drugs to boost immunity to the coronavirus.

The president is promising a vaccine by the end of the year, if not earlier, although medical professionals caution that such a timeline is far from certain.

Anthony Fauci, the chief US immunologist, would only say scientists are ""aspirationally hopeful"" that a vaccine would be ready by 2021.

Given that a return to normal life in the US appears increasingly contingent on a safe and reliable vaccine, a lot is riding on these hopes.",2020-07-14,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-53337483
Katya Adler,Brexit: Will return of face-to-face talks mean progress?,"Image copyright EPA Image caption Unlike the recent videoconference, leaders plan to meet face-to-face - Covid-19 permitting

So the ""tiger in the tank"" (Prime Minister Boris Johnson's words) of EU-UK post-Brexit trade talks is all geared up to pounce.

Monday sees the start of a month of intensified negotiations between the two sides. This will include weekly meetings - at times in London, at others, in Brussels. And the first face-to-face talks since the Covid-19 pandemic hit Europe, infecting the EU and the UK's chief negotiators.

The idea of revving up the frequency of negotiating rounds was given a blessing at the highest political level a couple of weeks ago, when the prime minister held a summit via video link with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

Both sides have underlined their commitment to agreeing and ratifying a deal by the end of the year.

What can we expect after July's tiger pounce?

Well, the government wants to see the outline of an EU-UK trade deal by the end of the summer. This is in order to give UK businesses time to prepare themselves for a new working relationship with the EU, starting 1 January - after the transition period ends.

EU negotiators say they'll do their best.

Throughout this month, smaller groups of negotiators will focus on the main sticking points between the two sides- such as fishing and competition regulations, including environmental and - of key importance to the EU - state aid rules.

The hope is that face-to-face talks will facilitate the odd informal chat over coffee or a cooling-off walk around the block, allowing negotiators the breathing space to find solutions, rather than each side continuing to parrot already well-known red lines at one another via Zoom chat or similar.

But it's not going to be easy

Posturing and/or parroting is pretty straight-forward. Agreeing political compromises is anything but.

You could say, if they were not willing to make concessions, neither the EU, nor the UK would have signed up to releasing tigers into tanks.

Or you could cynically note that neither side would want to be seen to be the one responsible for a politically and economically costly no-deal scenario come the end of this year.

Brussels has indicated that it is willing to be flexible, as long as principles are protected, like protecting the single market. But what does that mean in practice?

EU leaders say they have full confidence in their chief negotiator, Michel Barnier. But at their summit earlier this month, they demanded he keep them well-informed every step of the way.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The UK and EU have so far failed to agree on fishing and competition rules

The EU's eight coastal nations are wary. They want to keep pretty much the same fishing rights in UK waters they enjoyed while the UK was a member state. Mr Barnier has described theirs as a ""maximalist position"". The other 19 EU members won't want trade talks with the UK to collapse over fishing.

EU divisions are not something to celebrate

The EU's united front may come under some strain as the pressure grows to compromise with the UK.

Pragmatic Germany assumes the EU's rotating six month presidency this week. Chancellor Angela Merkel is clear - she has repeatedly insisted that she's not in favour of pursuing a UK deal ""at any price"".

But no-deal would be costly to German businesses and a blot on her political legacy. She may find herself having to reason with France's Emmanuel Macron, who - so far - has taken the toughest line in Brexit negotiations.

That Franco-German ""drama"", if it ever unfolds (and if it does, it will likely be limited in size and play out behind closed doors) is one lined up for next season.

The Germans have a timetable, too - for their EU presidency. This summer, they say, is dedicated to trying to get all EU members behind a common recovery fund to help European economies hardest hit by Covid-19. The focus won't be on post-Brexit relations until the autumn, says Berlin.

Despite the rhetoric about racing for a summer deal, that timeline may be more comfortable for the prime minister. He might feel full freedom to manoeuvre, considering his 80-seat parliamentary majority. But compromises may be easier for him to make in the autumn, with the clock ticking down to a potential no-deal - which much of UK industry and many MPs would oppose.

One thing for London to remember: an EU divided over concessions would not be something to celebrate. Every EU country and the European parliament will need to give the nod to a future relations agreement. Or there will be no deal at all.",2020-07-14,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-53215711
Andrea Marechal Watson,Beautiful homes for extended families,"The problem is particularly acute in the UK where escalating house prices have resulted in the rise of the boomerang generation – kids who come back to the family nest for economic reasons. In addition to the boomerangs – many of them graduates paying off student loans – we have the stickarounds, children living at home well into their 30s because it is the only chance of scraping together a deposit to buy a home of their own. And on top of this lot are separated or divorced families, as well as a rising tide of grannies and grandads. New research from investment broker Charles Stanley finds the desire to avoid escalating retirement or care-home costs is driving this trend.

There is however only so much space below stairs and under rooves that the typical home can make available to all these extra residents, so it comes as little surprise that a survey by Propertyheads.com found that interest in the ‘granny annexe’ has increased. According to the site: “After analysing the results of over 3,000 searches conducted during March and April 2020, some interesting patterns emerged which show how buyer behaviour has already started to change ahead of the easing of lockdown restrictions. The results revealed that searches for granny annexes were up by 16%, suggesting that the forced separation from older parents has made many realise that having them close by and ideally in a building attached to the same property is now a key factor in future property purchases.”

But what is really needed are not annexes but a fundamental rethink of housing and planning, and it is already happening across Europe and the US. In Germany, projects include the Mehrgenerationhaus (multi-generation house) programme, while Holland’s government has set a goal of creating 500,000 multi-generational homes by 2040. Initiatives in the UK include the Don’t Move Improve scheme and Superbia, a strategy to increase housing by using overlooked small sites such as gardens and rooftops in London’s suburban areas. There are an estimated four million gap sites (existing spaces between terraces or large gardens) in London alone.",2020-07-06,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20200706-beautiful-homes-for-extended-families
Padraig Belton,'Horrible' offices look to tempt back workers,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Staff will go to great lengths to avoid touching buttons - this lift in Iran has been kitted out with small sticks for people to use

""Many of us spend most of our waking lives in offices and typically they're horrible,"" says Maciej Markowski, chief executive of spaceOS, a start-up based in Warsaw.

Before coronavirus offices were ""a mix of noise, distraction and an endless search for a free meeting room,"" he says.

Mr Markowski's company makes an app and other technology that connects tenants with their workplaces.

He thinks that if building owners want to keep their tenants happy, then they need to be looking at different kinds of data.

""The craziest thing is: corporate real estate is really data focused, you have tremendous information on occupancy, electricity and water usage,"" says Mr Markowski.

However, that ""doesn't give you a single clue what to do to keep a tenant, no idea what these people do in the building, what they like and dislike, any tools to keep them,"" he says.

With millions of people working from home since the coronavirus pandemic, office owners will have to work harder to tempt them back.

Many staff are going to see big changes when they return.

""I popped in last week for a few hours, and saw some Star Trek-style sensors you wave your hand over to exit, rather than pressing a button,"" says Elizabeth Hoefsmit, managing director of Hampshire-based McGinley Aviation, which uses serviced offices in a business park.

It might be infrared temperature checks in the lobby, contactless lifts, or new apps to spread workers out and keep shared surfaces clean, but there's no doubt the post-coronavirus office is getting a drastic technological refit.

More Technology of Business

It could all start as soon as you wake up in the morning. You may check your building app, says David Garten, vice president at RXR Realty which owns and manages 93 properties in the New York area.

The firm's new app creates a building health index each day, from information like air quality, the number of occupants, and how well social distancing is being observed.

If your building has a low rating that day, you might decide to work from home, or go to a smaller satellite office instead.

The app will also tell you the ideal time to arrive, to reduce congestion, and people riding public transport at peak times. ""So the ideal time for me to walk through our lobby is 10am,"" says Mr Garten.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Fever screening is a common sight

Then on entering, you may pass through an infrared fever-screening system, says James Lawrence of Gensler, a large design and architecture firm based in San Francisco.

FLIR Systems, one Oregon company that makes these crowd thermal cameras, has seen its demand increase 700%.

If a concierge judges you high risk from the infrared screening, they might double-check your temperature with a handheld device. Then, you might need to have your meeting by video conference from a quarantine room, or take a car home or to hospital.

If you make it through the lobby, then perhaps you will operate the lift with buttons on your app. Once upstairs, it will tell you when your workstation was last cleaned, Mr Garten says.

When it gets to lunchtime, you'll order food by an app, says John Robson, asset director at Workspace, which has 69 office properties around London focusing mainly on small companies.

Image copyright Workspace Image caption Workers will probably have to spread out more

""Every transaction is cashless now, and your food will basically be grab and go,"" he says.

If you pop to the loo after lunch, you'll be increasingly looking at touchless taps, Mr Lawrence says.

New software is helping companies spread people out.

Gensler's tool ReRun imports floor plans, calculates safe bubbles around each worker, and then outputs different ways to place workers so their bubbles do not overlap.

""Recently we did an analysis on a two million square-foot building that took roughly 10 days to turn around. Otherwise it would've taken several weeks,"" says Mr Lawrence.

For the same reason, some companies are looking to teach artificial intelligence (AI) to video cameras.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Artificial intelligence can look for office ""pinch points""

AI algorithms can offer feedback about ""pinch points"" where people are too close together, while protecting individual privacy, says Dr Mahesh Saptharishi, Motorola Solutions' chief technology officer, based in Boston.

Instead of watching the actual video, they can ask the AI how well social distancing is being observed overall, and where problem points are. ""So employees don't feel someone's watching what they do,"" he says.

Meanwhile, your cleaner might well be employee of the month for many months to come.

An April study in The Lancet Microbe showed the virus can last on plastic and stainless steel (like door handles) for up to seven days, and glass (like screens) for four days.

Cleaning wipes can disrupt the layer of fat that surrounds and protects coronavirus. And bleach's active ingredient sodium hypochlorite destroys the crown of protein spikes that gives the virus its name, and the ribonucleic acid (RNA) which is its blueprint to reproduce. So does the ethanol in surgical spirits.

But it would be helpful to know which surfaces should be cleaned.

Contact tracing needs to keep track of the surfaces and facilities you and sick colleagues used, says Matt Calkins, head of US software development platform Appian, which has also made coronavirus workplace safety software.

If you know which of your rooms to target, you know where best to send your deep cleaning team, and maximise use of your bleach, ethanol and wipes, Mr Calkins says.

The virus can also be carried in the air, on water droplets or fine dust particles, say researchers. So what about air conditioning systems?

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Office owners will be working hard to make their buildings attractive

The UK government says the risk of air conditioning spreading coronavirus in the workplace is ""extremely low"".

Nevertheless, ""we're advising organisations to look at their air conditioning system,"" says Dr Mark Parrish, Northern European medical director from International SOS, which advises companies about medical risks.

Filters with extremely narrow openings - like high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) and the more powerful ultra-low particulate air (ULPA) ones - can remove coronavirus from circulating in the air, according to UK air filter manufacturer SPCB.

The problem is such ventilation systems will normally need stronger fans to push air through these narrower filters, it says.

Upgrading air conditioning could be one of many options used by office owners to keep their tenants happy.

Maciej Markowski of spaceOS says simple convenience might be the winning factor.

""It's ridiculous that you're in a building and it's easier to order food from across town than the restaurant downstairs. Or with three taps on your phone you can tell Amazon a package is broken, but there's no way to tell your building there's a huge spill in front of your office.""",2020-07-14,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-53056585
Helier Cheung,Coronavirus: Why attitudes to masks have changed around the world,"Image copyright Reuters/Andrew Parsons Media Image caption Donald Trump and Boris Johnson both wore masks in public recently

In the past few days, both US President Donald Trump and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson have been seen wearing masks in public for the first time.

It's a dramatic turnaround - Mr Trump previously mocked others for wearing masks, and suggested some might wear such personal protective equipment to show their disapproval of him, even after the US Centers for Disease Control recommended face coverings.

Meanwhile, the UK government was initially reluctant to advise the general public to wear face coverings, even as other countries in Europe did.

It introduced rules requiring people to wear face coverings on public transport in June, and now says people in England must wear face coverings in shops or face a fine.

Globally, many authorities - including the World Health Organization (WHO) - initially suggested that masks were not effective in preventing the spread of the coronavirus. However, they are now recommending face coverings in indoor spaces, and many governments have even made them mandatory.

What's changed - and why?

The number of governments recommending face coverings has gone up significantly over the past six months.

As of mid-March, about 10 countries had policies recommending face coverings - now more than 130 countries and 20 US states do, says Masks4All, an activist group of researchers that advocates the use of homemade masks during the pandemic.

Some studies also suggest that people's attitudes have changed.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Coronavirus: How to wear a face covering

""Countries with no previous history of wearing face masks and coverings amongst the general public rapidly adopted usage such as in Italy (83.4%), the United States (65.8%) and Spain (63.8%),"" says a report by the Royal Society - one of the leading science bodies in the UK.

The changes appear to be partly due to a better understanding of how Covid-19 spreads.

Initially, the WHO said masks should only be worn by medical workers, or people who had symptoms like coughing and sneezing.

However, in recent months, there's been increased evidence that many people with the virus do not have symptoms - but can still be contagious - and masks can stop them from passing it on to others. The WHO changed its guidance in June.

Meanwhile, there is more awareness that the risk of transmission is higher in poorly ventilated indoor spaces - and evidence to suggest that the virus could be spread by tiny particles suspended in the air.

This means that if everyone wears face coverings it will ""protect against the most common mode of transmission - droplets - and to some extent maybe aerosol droplets,"" says Kim Lavoie, chair of behavioural medicine at the University of Quebec at Montreal's psychology department.

Prof Lavoie adds that ""there has been increased research"" into face coverings, including observational studies which indicate ""countries with high mask wearing seem to have lower infection rates"".

Furthermore, a number of scientists now say there is ""some evidence"" that masks can protect the wearer as well as those around them.

There is also growing acceptance that the pandemic could continue for a long time - and, if so, face coverings could be seen as something necessary to help people adapt, and reduce risks as businesses and schools re-open.

""Covid's not going anywhere - we'll probably have a vaccine in years, not months,"" says Prof Lavoie, who has been leading the iCARE Study, an international survey into Covid-19 related behaviours. ""So all these principles need to be integrated and adapted to the new normal life.""

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Cases spike as nightlife returns in Arizona

Why do countries have such different attitudes?

Even as government policies have changed - there's a big gap in how willing people are to wear masks.

About 83% of people in Italy, and 59% in the US, say they would always wear a face mask outside their home - but only 19% of people in the UK say the same, according to the Covid-19 Behaviour Tracker - a project run by the Institute of Global Health Innovation at Imperial College London with polling company YouGov.

""The US, UK and Canada have been relatively slow to accelerate mask wearing versus, for example, Spain, France and Italy,"" says Sarah P Jones, a health behaviour researcher at Imperial College London, and one of the creators of the tracker.

She says mask wearing can vary based on how vulnerable people feel about an illness, whether they believe the costs outweigh the benefits, and how readily available masks are.

In countries with steep rises in mask wearing, people may have experienced ""rapid increases in perceptions of severity and vulnerability"", ""rapid policy changes mandating use of face masks"", and a sense that ""I see lots of other people doing it, so it must not be a big deal to wear a mask"".

Prof Lavoie agreed that places that ""got hit quickly and hard"", like Italy, may have adopted mask wearing more readily.

Finally, people in countries that experienced the 2003 Sars pandemic - or other respiratory outbreaks - were readier to start wearing masks.

""In East Asia, there's plenty of recent memory of respiratory pandemics, and a cultural awareness that masks are a good idea,"" says Jeremy Howard, a research scientist at the University of San Francisco, and one of the Masks4All founders.

By contrast, ""there's just no recent history of respiratory pandemics in the West"" and many Western and international institutions have ""almost entirely ignored East Asian scientists"", he argues.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Many populations in East Asia were quick to start wearing masks

Many countries were particularly cautious over recommending face masks because of a lack of clinical trials proving their effectiveness, says the Royal Society's report.

However, ""there have been no clinical trials of coughing into your elbow, social distancing and quarantine, yet these measures are seen as effective and have been widely adopted,"" it adds.

Why are some still reluctant to wear masks?

A majority of countries now recommend or require face coverings in some situations.

However, most people still appear much more willing to use hand sanitiser, social distance or wash their hands regularly, than wear face masks, according to data from both the Covid-19 Behaviour Tracker, and iCARES.

People feel that hand washing and social distancing are things they can easily control, says Prof Lavoie.

By contrast, ""mask wearing is a little more complex - you have to find and purchase a mask, put it on and dispose of it a certain way, and they're uncomfortable to wear.""

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption President Trump: ""I've never been against masks but I do believe they have a time and a place""

And the changing guidance from the WHO and many governments could have caused difficulties.

Many experts believe that governments were reluctant to recommend face coverings because they feared there would be a shortage of PPE equipment for medical workers - but by suggesting that they were ineffective at preventing transmissions, they now sound inconsistent.

""Mixed messaging, not being transparent about data, or how the government makes certain policy decisions, can undermine trust"" and make it harder to convince people to wear face coverings now, Prof Lavoie says.

Mr Howard believes that many governments in the West were slow to act on masks until they were badly affected by the pandemic.

Nonetheless, he thinks that Boris Johnson and Donald Trump can have a positive impact now by wearing masks publicly.

""Role models are absolutely real,"" he says, and ever since Mr Trump wore a mask, ""a lot of folks who were previously anti-mask are now saying that was a patriotic thing for him to do.""

This is especially important now that the US is experiencing a new wave of infections, he adds.",2020-07-14,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-53394525
Pablo Uchoa,Coronavirus: Will women have to work harder after the pandemic?,"Image copyright THB Brazil Image caption Simone Ramos says women are trying to work ""double shifts""

Like many successful career women, Simone Ramos feels she's had to work harder than any man to get to the top.

A high-flying executive and risk manager for global insurance group THB in Sao Paulo, Ms Ramos says being a female leader in a male-dominated industry has forced her “to be stronger and rise above myself every day"".

“Very early on in my career I realised I needed to leave the office later, I needed to study more, I needed to prove myself three times more than any man,” she says.

Ms Ramos is also an adviser for the Brazilian association of women in the insurance market and has an upcoming book on the subject planned for October. She tells younger women they can reach the top with “focus, determination and clear goals”.

But like other experts, she is concerned about the extra pressures being put on women’s careers during the pandemic - and whether this can end up pushing them back.

‘Second shift’

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Observers say the pandemic is leaving working mothers feeling particularly fraught

The situation is particularly difficult in families where parents are trying to work from home while home schooling their children or caring for other relatives.

According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), it is still women who shoulder three-quarters of all unpaid care work.

“It's no secret that mothers still carry most of the burden of childcare and domestic work in most families,” says Justine Roberts, the founder and chief executive of Mumsnet, the UK’s biggest online network for parents.

Ms Roberts says this reality is “piling the pressure” on women and leaving mothers particularly “fraught”.

“Mothers are worried that they're putting themselves at risk of redundancy, or getting into trouble at work because they haven't been able to perform as well as they usually do.""

Image copyright Vicki Couchman Image caption Justine Roberts says the reality of the pandemic is ""piling the pressure"" on women

“Even if women feel their jobs or incomes are relatively safe, many are saying they just can't carry on like this for much longer.”

Ms Ramos points out that women have traditionally carried out a “second shift” at home once their work day had finished.

Now most women she knows “are trying to work the two shifts at the same time” - and the mental health toll is driving some to consider quitting, or effectively quitting their jobs during the pandemic.

‘The workplace is outdated’

“We really have to get on the ball about the reality of how women are experiencing the workplace,” says Allyson Zimmermann, a director for Catalyst, a global NGO which works with corporations to improve the workplace for women.

“The system is outdated. And when you look at it, it’s in the interest of corporations to find a new normal in the workplace after Covid.""

Catalyst has spent years tracking the careers of 10,000 MBA graduates, both male and female, from 26 leading business schools in Asia, Canada, Europe and the US.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Catalyst says there are implicit biases which slow down progress for women at all career levels

In its research, the organisation has observed how the lack of flexible work options impacts women’s motivation as they enter motherhood.

But there are also implicit biases that act strongly to slow down progress for women, irrespective of their experience or whether or not they have children.

For example, women in the Catalyst studies were more likely than men to start at a lower level in their first post-MBA job. And when men worked long hours, this strategy seemed to help their careers, but not women’s.

Male graduates were rewarded with pay rises as soon as they switched between firms, but women’s salaries seemed to increase only after they proved themselves to their managers first.

“Women have to constantly improve performance, whereas men are promoted based on potential,” Ms Zimmermann says.

“There's this perception out there that if women were doing exactly the same thing men were doing, that they would advance. And the truth is, no. Women are often held to a much higher standard than men. It's a very unconscious bias.”

Economic crisis makes it harder

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A US study has found shareholders of companies in trouble were less receptive to appointing female directors

A new US study by academics at different universities suggests those biases can re-emerge strongly during economic crises.

The upcoming paper has found women trying to join the very top bodies in firms - the board of directors - have a much tougher time when companies are struggling.

After analysing 50,000 board elections in 1,100 publicly listed companies between 2003 and 2015, the researchers found shareholders were normally happy to support female directors when everything was going well.

However, if the company got into trouble or if there was a crisis, they were much more likely to withdraw their support for the female candidate.

Those women were held to much higher standards than their peers, and were more likely to leave the company in subsequent years.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Studies suggest diversity gives companies an edge to compete in the market

One of the study's co-authors, Corinne Post, from Lehigh University in the US state of Pennsylvania, says: “It’s hard to find another explanation, other than those biases around women’s commitments or whether they are really working as hard as they should.”

Another co-author, Arjun Mitra, from California State University, adds that companies were undermining their female talent “at a time when they could benefit the most from female leadership qualities”.

“It sends a very strong signal that the firms are not that supportive of having women in leadership roles.”

Lower-paid women are also being impacted

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The coronavirus pandemic is already affecting women in lower-paid occupations

The world has made huge improvements towards gender equality in the past 50 years, but it will be at least another century before men and women close the gaps in the workplace, according to the World Economic Forum (WEF).

And Covid-19 is already having an impact on women in lower income brackets.

The economic crisis has destroyed women’s jobs more than men’s, because it is hitting economic sectors where women are overrepresented in the workforce, like accommodation, food, retail and manufacturing.

In Central America, for example, 59% of women are employed in those sectors, while in South East Asia it’s 49% and in South America 45%.

In the US, female unemployment is higher than male.

“Previous crises have shown that when women lose their jobs, their engagement in unpaid care work increases, and that when jobs are scarce, women are often denied job opportunities available to men,” the International Labour Organization (ILO) warns.

'One step back and two forward'

Image copyright M Square Image caption Luciana Barros says women in the post-Covid world will need to make sure the companies they want to work for truly value merit

But whatever the impact, the pandemic will eventually pass, and Simone Ramos believes it will give way to a ""new reality"" to which businesses have already started to adapt.

She believes firms are beginning to take a more ""compassionate look"" and will offer more flexible work options to suit employees' personal circumstances as standard.

“I think we’ll take one step back and two steps forward,"" says Luciana Barreto, the chief executive of M Square, an asset management company with a global portfolio worth $1bn.

Ms Barreto says women are increasingly aware of the importance of their careers “to free and fulfil” them, so “the struggle for gender equality doesn't end here”.

But she believes in the post-pandemic job market it will be even more crucial for women to “take ownership” of their careers, and question whether the companies they want to work for truly value merit.

Allyson Zimmermann agrees, and says she usually tells female business students to look at what’s happening at the top of firms before they apply for jobs there.

“When you're looking for your employer, you’re not looking for perfection, but progress. If you do not see yourself represented in the leadership, or if you don’t see that they’re actively working towards that… then I would look elsewhere,” she says.",2020-07-14,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-53363253
Suzanne Bearne,The perfume makers that can't smell a thing,"Image copyright Givauden Image caption The Carto system can store 1,500 ingredients

Do you need a human to create a beautiful scent? That's the question being asked as artificial intelligence (AI) starts to infiltrate the perfume industry.

Companies are increasingly turning to technology in order to create more bestselling, unique fragrances that can be produced in just minutes.

Last year, Swiss-based fragrance developer Givaudan Fragrances launched Carto, an artificial Intelligence-powered tool to help perfumers.

Through machine learning (a way computers improve outcomes automatically by learning from past results) Carto can suggest combinations of ingredients.

Using a touch screen, the perfumer can pull together different scents using data from the brand's vast library of fragrance formulas - a much more efficient process than using spreadsheets. A small robot immediately processes the fragrances into perfumes, making it easier for perfumers to test their new scents.

""It's about finding a way to give more time to the perfumer,"" says Calice Becker, vice president perfumer and director of the Givaudan Perfumery School.

""The perfumers can choose from 1,500 ingredients and put it in a bottle without touching the ingredients. It helps to make sure you don't lose time and have to look at your notebooks.""

Image copyright Givauden Image caption The Carto systems can create fragrances very quickly

Ms Becker says the process of perfumery has evolved over the years and this is just the next step.

""Up until about 40 years ago, perfumers worked with all the ingredients in front of them and they'd grab the ingredients and write down the amounts and names of ingredients on a piece of paper.""

The 1980s saw the introduction of computers and perfumers would create their concoctions through a system that looked like an Excel spreadsheet, she says.

One benefit of Carto is that samples are created instantly, giving them a competitive advantage. ""We can adjust the perfume almost live with the customer,"" says Ms Becker.

""It is a big plus not just because we gain time but there's more intimacy when we connect in front of the tool.""

What has been their customer's reaction? ""We have some early adopters but some say they will never use it,"" she says. ""I think that's totally normal. But it's created a lot of buzz from customers interested to see how they can see creations with it.""

Image copyright Symrise Image caption AI is not designed to replace perfumers

German fragrance house Symrise has gone one step further and teamed up with IBM Research to create an AI called Philyra, named after the Greek goddess of perfume, that actually studies the aromatic formulas and customer data to produce new fragrances.

Philyra was taught in a similar way to an apprentice perfumer, who can study for 10 years before making good new scents.

Like Carto, Philyra can't actually sniff anything.

Instead, families of smells, including florals, orientals and chypre, were coded along with the different requirements of products like shampoos, deodorants and skin lotions.

The AI was also taught about how much of each ingredient would be appropriate.

Claire Viola, vice president of digital strategy fragrance at Symrise, is the first to agree it hasn't been without flaws.

""It's machine-learning and sometimes the results have been wrong,"" she says. ""It's still a project, the more we test, the more it continues to improve. It constantly needs training. You have to qualify every new material, so it understands the difference between different florals and oriental scents, for example.""

Image copyright Symrise Image caption Philyra: It ""never forgets"" but still needs training, says Claire Viola

But, she says, the more they invest in training, the more accurate it becomes.

""We taught it to be like a perfumer... the machine never forgets [compared to humans]. The good thing is that the machine comes up with a selection of scents and interesting combinations that you wouldn't have thought of.""

Given that the machine has a database of close to two million aroma formulas - the potential for a wider range of scents and combinations is huge. In 2019 Brazilian cosmetics company O Boticário worked with Symrise to launch the first fragrance using artificial intelligence.

More Technology of Business

One company is shaking up the sector by giving consumers the opportunity to play with the technology directly.

In Breda in the Netherlands, ScenTronix allows customers to create their own personalised scent based on a questionnaire they answer when they walk into its Algorithmic Perfumery shop.

After answering questions such as how do you see your role in life and what kind of environment did you go grow up in, the algorithm analyses the data to create unique perfumes for the customer within seven minutes. Customers can buy five samples for €30 ($33; £26).

Image copyright Scentronix Image caption Frederik Duerinck wants to move customers away from brand names

ScenTronix co-founder Frederik Duerinck says he wanted people to be able to wear a perfume that was a reflection of themselves in that current moment.

""The perfume industry is a lot about branding and adapting your identity to it,"" he explains. ""I thought it would be a good idea to completely change the dynamic and and so the perfume becomes about who you are and not about the brand.""

Mr Duerinck agrees there is a major physiological barrier to overcome as people aren't used to paying for a fragrance they're unable to test until it's been produced.

However, he says they try to overcome that hurdle by having someone on site to help customers. ""Although I'd say 75% of the time it is spot on, we always have a professional there [to help],"" he says.

Margaux Caron, global beauty analyst for colour cosmetics and fragrance at Mintel, believes artificial intelligence is a powerful tool to create fragrances that are original.

""Not only do they [AI tools] identify olfactory white spaces but they also dramatically optimise the speed of fragrance creation for perfumers.

""Technology and science are sometimes pictured and perceived as cold and rational, but the fragrance category is displaying a warm, emotional, human approach to it. The partnership between AI and perfumers is anchored in this philosophy.""

So does the introduction of technology spell the end of the perfumer? Not according to those I spoke to.

""It will never stop the role of the perfumer,"" says Ms Becker. ""The computer will never come up with beautiful ideas. But it can help bring them alive.""

Ms Viola agrees, adding that it's complementary support to their work, allowing them to experiment much more.

""It's not replacing the perfumer,"" she says. ""It's helping them to be better faster and creative and freeing them from boring tasks. It still starts and ends with the perfumer. They're the ones with the intuition, emotion and feeling and guiding the machine to better results.""

For now at least, as Ms Viola says, ""It's a man-machine collaboration.""",2020-07-14,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-53189292

Yet its public health system is severely strained, and experts believe it is likely to reach a breaking point as Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government continues to ease a nationwide lockdown.

Initially, the country took some of the strictest measures anywhere to slow the spread of the coronavirus, including placing all 1.3 billion citizens under a nationwide lockdown. But the measures were brutally hard on the poorest Indians. Some of the restrictions were lifted in early May to help revive the economy, including allowing construction and plantation work to resume and many shops to reopen.

When Mr. Modi announced the lockdown, hundreds of thousands of migrant workers were initially stranded in cities without a way to reach their home villages. Some started long journeys on foot. Most headed back to the countryside because they couldn't afford the rent or food without work in the cities, and that just spread the virus across the larger swaths of the country.

How Cases Are Growing

India’s lockdown was largely considered effective, and it was widely obeyed. But with the measures largely lifted, anxiety is rising as the caseload surges, and more people have complained that they have been unable to find hospital beds.

India’s total caseload, which is over 767,000 now, has become the world’s third-largest. So far, a large chunk of India’s Covid-19 cases have come from five states: Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, counting for almost 60 percent of caseload, followed by Delhi, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh.

Public health experts have warned that the country’s testing figures were still far too restricted. But capacity has been rising: On July 9, more than 267,000 samples were tested in 24 hours, taking the total number of samples tested so to 10,740,832.

Erica L. Green,DeVos Abandons a Lifetime of Local Advocacy to Demand Schools Reopen,"WASHINGTON — As the nation’s public schools plunged into crisis at the outset of the coronavirus outbreak, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos stuck to the message of decades of conservative education advocacy.

She championed her trademark policies of local and parental control, freeing states of federal mandates, loosening rules and funding opportunities that she said would help schools “rethink education” outside their brick-and-mortar buildings.

But now, as President Trump pushes public schools to reopen this fall, Ms. DeVos is demanding they do as Washington says, a stance diametrically opposite to how she has led the department. Already a partisan lightning rod, she has become the face of the Trump administration’s efforts to pry open the schoolhouse doors through force and threats. Her presence, as arguably the most recognizable and divisive member of the administration next to Mr. Trump himself, has inflamed a debate that is roiling communities in every corner of the country.

“We have so politicized the situation we don’t know who we can trust, and it’s become very clear that we can’t trust her,” said Keri Rodrigues, the president of the National Parents Union, a collection of 200 advocacy organizations across 50 states representing parents from communities of color. “It’s as if the Trump administration gave her one sentence that she was supposed to stick to: Open the economy by any means necessary. Our lives are not valuable to them at all. We are a means to an end.”",2020-07-13,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/politics/betsy-devos-schools-coronavirus.html
Jeneen Interlandi,Why We’re Losing the Battle With Covid-19,"As 2020 wears on, Shah and others are grappling with a new and bitter reality: Because of the economic crisis, which was triggered by the current pandemic, which was worsened by a lack of public-health investment, public-health agencies will probably suffer more budget cuts in the coming years. “It’s not like the environmental movement or even the health care reform movement, where you have activists and lobbyists and advocates fighting to change the status quo or to secure their piece of the pie,” Hearne told me. “It’s a lot of isolated departments across the country, saying, ‘Oh, we’ll just keep doing God’s work over here, and if our budget gets cut again, we’ll just make do somehow.’”

To change this, Shah, Hearne and others say, the public-health community will need to muster more political will than it has in the past. In the years preceding the coronavirus outbreak, the United States faced a host of public-health disasters: a resurgence of measles and syphilis; an uptick in food-borne illness; and a continuing lead-contaminated-water crisis. None of those issues captured even a fraction of the attention that universal health care did. In fact, while the health care system was discussed relentlessly in 2019, as it tends to be almost every election season, public health was barely mentioned at all. “No one is going to vote for you or name a hospital wing after you because you kept them from getting something that they didn’t think they were susceptible to in the first place,” Frieden says. “The people who cure diseases are glorified, not the people who prevent them.”

In late June, Abbott reversed course again and ordered the state’s bars to close and restaurants to reduce their capacity to 50 percent (they had been at 75 percent for several days). He also issued an executive order requiring all Texans in counties with more than 20 active Covid-19 cases to wear a mask in public. Scientists worried that it was too little too late, and by early July, the numbers seemed to prove them right. On July 8, the state hit a record 9,952 new coronavirus cases reported in a single day. The state’s positivity rate — the portion of all tests done that come out positive — also rose to 15.6 percent, from 7.9 percent just three weeks earlier.

Hospital beds were filling up, hospital floors reconfigured and surge units readied. Doctors and nurses, in Harris County and elsewhere, have begun a worrying and familiar census-taking of ventilators and personal protective equipment. And the same stories that played out in Wuhan and Lombardy and Seattle and New York were beginning anew. And not only in Texas. In more than 35 states, including some that had previously brought their outbreaks under control, daily case counts are rising, positivity rates are rising and new grim records are being set — and then quickly surpassed. People in Texas, Florida, California and New Jersey are bracing for a second wave of outbreaks in the fall, even as the first wave has yet to fully recede. The root of this catastrophe, doctors, scientists and health historians say, is our failure to fully incorporate public health into our understanding of what it means to be a functioning society. Until we do that, we will be unable to effectively respond to crises like this one — let alone prevent them.

In Harris County, Hidalgo and her advisers have created a numerical and color-coded warning system so that residents know how dire the threat level is and exactly how cautious they need to be. “We needed something that was clear and concise, because the back and forth with all the orders was confusing people and causing them to tune out,” she told me. “I went with colors and numbers because some people like one and some people like the other, and I really just want this to stick.” Right now, Harris County is at the highest threat level: one (or red), meaning that the outbreak there is severe and uncontrolled and that people should leave home only to meet essential needs. As with all things coronavirus-related, it will take a while to see if people hear the message and heed it.

In the meantime, the political and cultural battles over how to respond to the coronavirus crisis have continued unabated. The Texas Education Agency said they would withhold funding for schools that don’t enable students to attend full-time, in-person, this fall. On July 8, the mayor of Houston, Sylvester Turner, prevailed on the city’s convention center to cancel the state Republican convention that was scheduled for mid-July. The state party has challenged the move in court.",2020-07-14,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/magazine/covid-19-public-health-texas.html
Peter Eavis,Want More Diversity? Some Experts Say Reward C.E.O.s for It,"Founders like Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Sergey Brin and Larry Page of Alphabet do not receive cash bonuses or stock-based compensation. But they control so much of their companies’ voting stock that they could pretty much single-handedly approve the inclusion of diversity targets in executive compensation. Facebook, for example, valued the 2019 compensation of its chief operating officer, Sheryl K. Sandberg, at $27 million.

Facebook said it had made “bold goals to build a more diverse and inclusive workplace,” adding that leaders were evaluated on inclusion and recruitment in their performance reviews. Google declined to comment.

That said, some tech companies have linked pay and diversity.

Achieving diversity goals helps determine one-sixth of the cash bonus of Microsoft’s chief executive, Satya Nadella, a bonus that last year totaled $10.8 million. “This is an important demonstration of executive commitment to creating an inclusive workplace, and we find this helps ensure there is shared accountability to make progress,” the company said in a statement.

Uber, which in the past was criticized for a cutthroat work culture, perhaps goes further than any other company. Diversity targets are embedded in the stock compensation of its chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, accounting for a fourth of his performance-based stock awards. Uber valued his performance award for last year at $6.25 million. The goals include achieving growth in the percentage of workers who are from underrepresented ethnic groups at the senior analyst level and above over a three-year period that has not ended.

Bo Young Lee, Uber’s chief diversity and inclusion officer, said the policy had “really crystallized what we’re trying to achieve, and gave something for us to pivot off of, and explore other aspects of our diversity and inclusion strategy.”

But diversity-related goals may end up having less bite than advertised because they might be relatively easy to achieve, which can be hard to evaluate when companies do not disclose details about their goals. In addition, even companies that use this approach do not let it determine a sizable portion of overall pay.",2020-07-14,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/business/economy/corporate-diversity-pay-compensation.html
Paul Krugman,Opinion | America Drank Away Its Children’s Future,"And the experience of the Northeast, the first major epicenter of the U.S. pandemic, shows that we could have achieved something similar here. Death rates are way down, although still higher than in Europe; on Saturday, for the first time since March, New York City reported zero Covid-19 deaths.

Would a longer lockdown have been economically sustainable? Yes.

It’s true that strong social distancing requirements led to high unemployment and hurt many businesses. But even America, with its ramshackle social safety net, was able to provide enough disaster relief — don’t call it stimulus! — to protect most of its citizens from severe hardship.

Thanks largely to expanded unemployment benefits, poverty didn’t soar during the lockdown. By some measures it may even have gone down.

True, there were holes in that safety net, and many people did suffer. But we could have patched those holes. Yes, emergency relief costs a lot of money, but we can afford it: The federal government has been borrowing huge sums, but interest rates have remained near historical lows.

Put it this way: At its most severe, the lockdown seems to have reduced G.D.P. by a little over 10 percent. During World War II, America spent more than 30 percent of G.D.P. on defense, for more than three years. Why couldn’t we absorb a much smaller cost for a few months?",2020-07-13,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/opinion/coronavirus-schools-bars.html
Ross Douthat,Opinion | 10 Theses About Cancel Culture,"Cancel culture is destroying liberalism. No, cancel culture doesn’t exist. No, it has always existed; remember when Brutus and Cassius canceled Julius Caesar? No, it exists but it’s just a bunch of rich entitled celebrities complaining that people can finally talk back to them on Twitter. No, it doesn’t exist except when it’s good and the canceled deserve it. Actually, it does exist, but — well, look, I can’t explain it to you until you’ve read at least four open letters on the subject.

These are just a few of the answers that you’ll get to a simple question — “What is this cancel culture thing, anyway?” — if you’re foolish enough to toss it, like chum, into the seething waters of the internet. They’re contradictory because the phenomenon is complicated — but not complicated enough to deter me from making 10 sweeping claims about the subject.

So here goes:

1. Cancellation, properly understood, refers to an attack on someone’s employment and reputation by a determined collective of critics, based on an opinion or an action that is alleged to be disgraceful and disqualifying.

“Reputation” and “employment” are key terms here. You are not being canceled if you are merely being heckled or insulted — if somebody describes you as a moron or a fascist or some profane alternative to “Douthat” on the internet — no matter how vivid and threatening the heckling becomes. You are decidedly at risk of cancellation, however, if your critics are calling for you to be de-platformed or fired or put out of business, and especially if the call is coming from inside the house — from within your professional community, from co-workers or employees or potential customers or colleagues, on a professional message board or Slack or some interest-specific slice of social media.

2. All cultures cancel; the question is for what, how widely and through what means.

There is no human society where you can say or do anything you like and expect to keep your reputation and your job. Reputational cancellation hung over the heads of Edith Wharton’s heroines; professional cancellation shadowed 20th-century figures like Lenny Bruce. Today, almost all critics of cancel culture have some line they draw, some figure — usually a racist or anti-Semite — that they would cancel, too. And social conservatives who criticize cancel culture, especially, have to acknowledge that we’re partly just disagreeing with today’s list of cancellation-worthy sins.",2020-07-14,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/opinion/cancel-culture-.html
Julia Horowitz,California's new lockdown could be brutal for the economy,"A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business' Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here

London (CNN Business) The state of California is shutting down again — a huge blow to the fragile recovery logged in recent months.

The latest: As Covid-19 cases surge, Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered the closure of all indoor restaurants, wineries, movie theaters, zoos, museums and bars. Los Angeles and San Diego said their kids would start the new school year online only.

On its own, California is the fifth largest economy in the world, according to World Bank data. That means fresh lockdown measures in the state are a huge blow to the economic outlook, both in the United States and globally.

The governor's announcement weighed on stocks Monday. The S&P 500 at one point was up 1.6% and briefly turned positive for 2020, but sank about 0.9% by market's close.

Still, the decline seems muted when considering California's heft. US stocks ticked up again in premarket trading, and the S&P 500 remains 41% above its March low.

Not just California: Restrictions are also being tightened in other US states, including Oregon and New Mexico. And they're returning in Hong Kong, where Disneyland is closing again as the government tightens social-distancing measures.

In the United Kingdom, GDP data for May disappointed, with growth remaining extremely depressed. Economic output rose just 1.8% following a record contraction of more than 20% month-over-month in April.

Kallum Pickering of Berenberg Bank notes that there's no need to panic yet — large parts of the UK economy remained locked down in May, as the country's reopening lagged behind Europe. But the data is a warning that policymakers need to ""remain aggressive in their efforts to stimulate demand,"" he said.

Banks brace for a wave of bad loans

Before the pandemic, America's banks were raking in record profits , aided by President Donald Trump's tax cuts and a growing economy. Now, in the face of the worst downturn since the Great Depression, widespread corporate bankruptcies and near-zero interest rates, their fortunes have changed dramatically.

Citigroup C What's happening: JPMorgan Chase andare expected to reveal their second-quarter profits crashed by 50% or more when they report earnings for the April to June quarter on Tuesday, my CNN Business colleague Matt Egan reports. Wells Fargo is likely to slash its coveted dividend and announce the bank's first quarterly loss since the 2008 financial crisis.

""2020 has been a disaster,"" said Jim Shanahan, who covers banks at Edward Jones. ""It wasn't the banks' fault. It was like we had an alien invasion in the second quarter.""

JPMorgan Chase JPM Wells Fargo WFC Bank stocks reflect this grim reality. The KBW Bank Index, which tracks the largest US lenders, has slid nearly 35% this year while the broader market is flirting with gains. Shares of, the country's biggest bank, have dropped 30%, while stock in, which was already battling fallout from a string of scandals, is off nearly 53%.

As banks reveal their results, investors will be hyper-attuned not only to commentary on the economic and market outlook, but also on how banks are preparing for the wave of bad loans.

See here: S&P Global Ratings warned in a recent report that banks around the world could suffer credit losses of about $2.1 trillion in 2020 and 2021, in part due to a spike in toxic loans in China. The agency thinks losses could hit $1.3 trillion this year alone, more than double the level breached in 2019.

Bad loans will eat up a substantial portion of earnings at banks, S&P said. That could limit their ability to cover losses in other parts of the business, the agency cautioned.

Remember: The Federal Reserve is requiring all large US banks to suspend share buybacks in the third quarter and will cap shareholder dividends to the amount paid in the second quarter to preserve capital.

But regulators have made clear that the US banking system is in much better shape than it was during the 2008 financial crisis, and should have enough money on hand to keep lending to customers to support the economic recovery.

A bright spot: Investment banking looks solid as companies rush to tap resurgent capital markets.

Keefe, Bruyette & Woods forecasts that investment banking revenues for JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley will increase by 40% year-over-year following the second-best quarter for equity issuance since 2000.

Huawei under fire: The UK prepares to reverse course on 5G

The United Kingdom is expected to announce Tuesday that Huawei will be banned from participating in building the country's 5G network — a major about-face and a stinging loss for Huawei, my CNN Business colleague Hadas Gold reports.

The backstory: In January, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that Huawei would have a limited role in building the country's next-generation wireless networks. Now, the UK could require operators to strip Huawei equipment from their 5G networks within a few years, according to reports.

Such a decision would be a big win for the Trump administration, which has been pushing allies to exclude Huawei from their 5G systems. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared last month that ""the tide is turning against Huawei as citizens around the world are waking up to the danger of the Chinese Communist Party's surveillance state.""

New problems: The US campaign against Huawei was having mixed success until a new round of sanctions in May further reduced the company's ability to manufacture and obtain semiconductor chips using American-made technology.

European countries and mobile carriers are now worried that Huawei won't be able to provide 5G infrastructure as promised. But any action risks endangering their relationships with China at a tough moment. That's especially true for Britain, which is hunting for new trade opportunities around the world after Brexit.

Matt Egan,JPMorgan's profit plunges as credit costs spike on economic uncertainty,"New York (CNN Business) JPMorgan Chase, the nation's largest bank, reported a 51% plunge in second-quarter profits as provisions for credit losses spiked and the shape of the recovery became increasingly uncertain.

Matt Egan,"Verizon's alternative to layoffs: Retraining 20,000 workers","New York (CNN Business) Verizon hasn't laid off any of its 135,000 employees during the pandemic. Instead, the company has retrained around 20,000 workers for new careers.

It's part ofresponsible business plan announced Tuesday. Dubbed Citizen Verizon, the plan includes a pledge to prepare 500,000 mostly lower-wage people for jobs of the future by 2030 through skills training and job advancement tools.

While it's an expensive endeavor as other companies cut costs — millions of Americans are now collecting unemployment because of the unprecedented health crisis chose to focus on retraining workers, CEO Hans Vestberg told CNN Business in an exclusive interview.

""Verizon, as a large corporation, needs to take actions and be responsible here,"" said Vestberg, who became CEO two years ago , later adding, ""Large corporations have far bigger impacts than governments even, sometimes. We feel that responsibility as a corporation.""

The retraining programs will aim to teach vulnerable populations — especially those whose jobs are threatened by automation — digital skills and provide the mentorship needed to thrive in the modern economy. Verizon said the focus will be on lower-wage workers, including those who work in factories, restaurants and as drivers. There will be an emphasis on young, Black and Hispanic workers who have not gone to college.

As part of Citizen Verizon, the company is creating an education platform designed to support hybrid learning models being used in school districts across the United States. Verizon said the platform will provide digital literacy training for parents, remote learning resources for teachers and tech guidance for school districts. The program aims to provide 10 million children with digital access and skills training by 2030.

Biden calls for end of 'shareholder capitalism.' Verizon says it's already there

In May, Verizon ranked No. 1 in a Forbes and JUST Capital list of the responses to the pandemic among America's top publicly traded employers.

""Many of the decisions you're taking in a crisis like this, they will follow you for years because this is when people, customers, employees will remember how we acted,"" Vestberg said.

Verizon said it spent nearly $216 million last year in learning and development programs its employees.

The comments come amid a broader debate over the role of Corporate America. Last year, the Business Roundtable said corporations are responsible for improving society by serving all stakeholders — not just shareholders

Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, declared in a major speech last week that he will end the era of ""shareholder capitalism.""

Ericsson ERIC Vestberg, a former senior executive at Swedish telecom giant, said that's ""how we act"" every day: ""We want a positive outcome for all of our stakeholders because ultimately, to have a successful and growing company, the only way is actually to manage your customers, your shareholders, your employees and society.""

But Vestberg stresses that doesn't mean Verizon isn't still focused on making money.

""We should grow because ultimately that gives us the liberty to actually act on all the stakeholders,"" he said.

Corporate America is 'not doing enough' to fix inequality

But the recent protests around racial inequality suggest that far too many Americans have been left behind in the modern economy.

The median net worth of white households is about 10 times the median net worth of Black households , according to the Federal Reserve. The median income for Black households less than 60% of that of white households.

""It's clear they're not doing enough,"" Vestberg said of efforts by large companies to narrow those gaps. ""Every corporation, every organization needs to do this better in order to create more equality, both here in the US but also in the rest of the world.""",2020-07-14,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/14/business/verizon-jobs-ceo-hans-vestberg/index.html
Matt Egan,"Wells Fargo lost $2.4 billion last quarter, setting the stage for its first dividend cut since the Great Recession","New York (CNN Business) Wells Fargo swung to its first quarterly loss since the Great Recession, forcing the struggling bank to warn it will likely slash its coveted dividend by 80%.

The poor results were driven by soaring expenses linked to Wells Fargo's scandals and surging credit costs caused by the bank's darkening economic view.

Wells Fargo WFC suffered a loss of $2.4 billion during the second quarter, a sharp reversal from the $6.2 billion the lender earned a year ago. The bank lost 66 cents per share, more than three times as much as feared. It's Wells Fargo's first loss since late 2008 during the height of the financial crisis.

Revenue dropped by a steeper-than-expected 18% to $17.8 billion.

Wells Fargo said it expects to cut its dividend to just 10 cents a share, subject to board approval. That would make Wells Fargo the first major bank to do so, underscoring the fragile state the company entered the crisis. This marks a reversal from the Great Recession, when Wells Fargo, in 2009, was among the last of the big banks to cut its dividend because of its relative strength.

Julia Hollingsworth,Korean Air matriarch receives suspended jail sentence for abusing domestic staff,"(CNN Business) The matriarch of the Korean Air dynasty has been given a suspended jail sentence for assaulting her domestic staff, including physically hurting her chauffeur and throwing metal shears at her gardener.

However, the sentence has been suspended for three years, meaning that if she doesn't commit another crime in that time, she won't go to prison.

Lee Myung-hee, wife of the late Korean Air President Cho Yang-ho, center, arrives at the Seoul Central District Court in Seoul, May 2, 2019.

The accusations against Lee rocked South Korea and prompted a nationwide debate on abuse of staff, particularly in family-run conglomerates known as chaebols, which dominate the country's economy

Her suspended jail sentence is likely to be a blow to labor rights activists, who hoped that Lee's case could be a reckoning for chaebols , which have been linked with numerous accusations relating to the mistreatment of staff.

According to prosecutors, Lee's charges included using profane language, shouting and physically hurting employees including her chauffeur, and physically assaulting her gardener by throwing plants and metal shears at him. The offenses occurred between 2011 and 2018, prosecutors said.

Korean Air said it would not comment on Lee's sentence.

Scandal-plagued family

Lee is the third prominent member of the Korean Air dynasty to be accused of abusing staff.

In 2014, Lee's daughter, Heather Cho — who was vice president of Korean Air at the time — demanded that a plane she was on return to its gate so a flight attendant who served her macadamia nuts in a bag instead of a porcelain bowl could be removed.

She served five months of a one-year prison sentence after a South Korean court found her guilty of violating aviation law. After the flight attendant Park Chang-jin testified against Cho, he was demoted. In 2018, a court ruled that the demotion was legal, but awarded him $18,000 in damages for coercion and assault.

Cho's sister, Emily, also drew public anger in 2018 over reports that she insulted an advertising executive and threw water in his face.

She apologized, saying what she did was ""foolish."" Both sisters were fired from Korean Air by their father after the scandals.

The family have also faced accusations beyond abusing staff. Last year, both Heather Cho and Lee were given suspended jail sentences for smuggling luxury items via Korean Air planes, according to a report from national news wire Yonhap.

Cho Yang-ho's son succeeded him as chairman of the South Korean carrier last year.

Wider problem

Lee and her daughters are not the only elite family accused of abusing their staff.

According to Kim Eun-jung, an economy and labor specialist with the People's Solidarity for Participatory Democracy civic group, some chaebol owners run these major conglomerates as their own personal domains, with few external limits on their powers.

Kim said that past governments have enabled this pattern of abuse.

South Korean President Moon Jae-in has repeatedly promised to tackle problems with the chaebol system and root out gapjil — a Korean word for those in power who lord over their underlings — which he has described as a ""leading workplace evil.""

Last year, a new law came into effect meaning that bosses who unfairly fire workers that complain of office bullying now face up to three years in prison, or a 30 million won ($25,464) fine.

In 2017, a survey by the National Human Rights Commission of Korea found that over 73% of respondents had experienced harassment in the past year, while a quarter experienced harassment more than once a week.

Preston has one more movie coming out posthumously. In 2019, she filmed “Off the Rails” with Judi Dench. The film is about four friends in their 50's who spend five days traveling across Europe.

KELLY PRESTON'S DEATH IS LATEST HEARTBREAK FOR JOHN TRAVOLTA, FAMILY

In April 2019, Preston posted a photo of the cast and gushed about her opportunity to work with Dench, 85.

""Dream come true today shooting with Dame Judi Dench in London for @offtherailsfilms [sic] 🎉🎉#judidench,” she wrote on Instagram.

Preston also starred alongside Travolta, 66, in 2018 for the movie “Gotti.” The pair portrayed John and Victoria Gotti.

""We have the friendship and we have the rapport, so you can see the intimacy,"" Preston told Entertainment Tonight about starring alongside her husband. ""I looked at him and the way he looked at me was so completely ... I felt like I was in John Gotti's arms. It sent chills.""

She reportedly did her last red carpet appearance for the New York City premiere of “Gotti.”

Preston also cheered on her daughter Ella, 20, for her 2019 acting role alongside Travolta in the film “The Poison Rose.”

“Still in absolute awe of my stunning daughter @ella.travolta I just re-watched all of her interviews from this past week doing press for #thepoisonrose and she has jumped into ‘the family business’ as an absolute natural,” the mom gushed on Instagram.

She continued: “It floored me how poised, confident, elegant, sweet, gorgeous (I don’t think there are actually enough adjectives in the English language for me to properly articulate how perfectly she held her own)... I am beyond proud of her and all of her accomplishments, but most of all I am proud and honored to have her as my daughter. I love you and congratulations @ella.travolta.”

Preston revealed in an interview with “Good Morning America” in 2018 that her daughter is the one who got her to join Instagram. “She’s like ‘It’s about time! You have to join the century,’” she shared.

Through Instagram, the “Jerry McGuire” star shared a lot of loving posts about her family.

In May, she posted a photo of her and Ella and another one of Ben captioned, “My beautiful babies... I love you with all of my heart. Xxx.”

The doting mother also shared sweet messages for her late son Jett who died at age 16 in 2009 following a seizure.

“Happy Birthday to our sweetest Jetty, we love you!!” Preston captioned a photo in April of her hugging Jett.

That same month, the “Mischief” star shared a sweet tribute to those living with autism and special needs.

“I have a special place in my heart for those with autism and special needs. Sending love to some of my favorite people in the world,” Preston wrote. “My son Jetty was one of the most playful and wonderful souls you’ve ever met. Love to all of you with autism and special needs around the world.”

Preston also posted a lot about her love for Travolta. Her last Instagram post is dedicated to her husband for Father’s Day.

Leo Kelion,Huawei 5G kit must be removed from UK by 2027,"The UK's mobile providers are being banned from buying new Huawei 5G equipment after 31 December, and they must also remove all the Chinese firm's 5G kit from their networks by 2027.

Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden told the House of Commons of the decision.

It follows sanctions imposed by Washington, which claims the firm poses a national security threat - something Huawei denies.

Mr Dowden said the move would delay the country's 5G rollout by a year.

He added that the cumulative cost of this, and earlier restrictions announced against Huawei earlier in the year, would be up to £2bn.

""This has not been an easy decision, but it is the right one for the UK telecoms networks, for our national security and our economy, both now and indeed in the long run,"" he said.

Because the US sanctions only affect future equipment, the government does not believe there is a security justification for removing 2G, 3G and 4G equipment supplied by Huawei.

Huawei said the move was: ""bad news for anyone in the UK with a mobile phone"" and threatened to ""move Britain into the digital slow lane, push up bills and deepen the digital divide"".

New restrictions are also being applied to use of the company's broadband kit.

The government wants operators to ""transition away"" from purchasing new Huawei equipment for use in the full-fibre network.

Mr Dowden said he expected this to happen within two years.

He explained that additional time was being provided for broadband to avoid the UK becoming dependent on Nokia as the single supplier of some equipment.

Chip concerns

The UK last reviewed Huawei's role in its telecoms infrastructure in January, when it was decided to let the firm remain a supplier but introduced a cap on its market share.

But in May the US introduced new sanctions designed to disrupt Huawei's ability to get its own chips manufactured.

This led security officials to conclude they could no longer assure the security of its products if the company had to start sourcing chips from third-parties for use in its equipment.

Image copyright Parliament TV Image caption Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden said the moves were designed to ensure the long-term security of the UK's telecoms networks

The minister cited a review carried out by GCHQ's National Cyber Security Centre as being the motivation for the changes.

""Huawei claims to have stockpiles of parts that they can use, but this obviously affects what the NCSC can say about their products going forward,"" blogged Dr Ian Levy, the agency's technical director.

""We think that Huawei products that are adapted to cope with the [sanctions] are likely to suffer more security and reliability problems because of the massive engineering challenge ahead of them, and it will be harder for us to be confident in their use within our mitigation strategy.""

But other political considerations are also likely to have also come into play including the UK's desire to strike a trade deal with the US, and growing tensions with China over its handling of the coronavirus outbreak and its treatment of Hong Kong.

Some backbench Tory MPs had pressed for a shorter time-span for its removal, in particular there had been calls for the 5G ban to come into effect before the next election in May 2024.

However, Mr Dowden said that ""the shorter we make the timetable for removal, the greater the risk of actual disruption to mobile phone networks"".

BT and Vodafone had warned that customers could face mobile blackouts if they were forced to remove all of Huawei's 5G kit in less time.

Chairman resigns

Huawei says it employs about 1,600 people in the UK and claims to be one of Britain's largest sources of investment from China.

The firm - whose shares are not publicly traded - does not provide a regional breakdown of its earnings. But on Monday, it announced a 13% rise in sales for the first half of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019, totalling 454bn yuan ($64.8bn; £51.3bn).

The UK will have accounted for a fraction of that. The firm's UK chief recently noted that Huawei had only deployed a total of 20,000 base stations in the UK so far, but by contrast expects to deliver a total of 500,000 globally this year.

Even so, what the firm fears and Washington hopes is that other countries will now follow Westminster's lead with bans of their own.

Despite there seeming little chance of a U-turn, Huawei said it was still urging UK ministers to reconsider.

""We will conduct a detailed review of what today's announcement means for our business here and will work with the UK government to explain how we can continue to contribute to a better connected Britain,"" spokesman Ed Brewster said.

Shortly before the announcement Sky News revealed that Lord Browne, Huawei's UK chairman and the ex-chief executive of BP, would be leaving the Chinese company before his term had expired. It said he had given his notice a few days ago and would formally step down in September.

Image caption Lord Browne is stepping down six months before his time at Huawei was due to end

Lord Browne had led efforts to improve the company's image in the UK and had tried to prevent a ban.

""He has been central to our commitment here dating back 20 years, and we thank him for his valuable contribution,"" said Huawei, confirming the report.

Industry reaction

BT is set to be the telecoms operator most affected by the decision given it runs both the EE mobile network and Openreach, which provides fixed-line infrastructure to individual internet providers.

""We need to further analyse the details and implications of this decision before taking a view of potential costs and impacts,"" it said.

The move should, however, benefit Nokia and Ericsson, which are the two other main 5G kit vendors.

""We have the capacity and expertise to replace all of the Huawei equipment in the UK's networks at scale and speed... with minimal impact on the people using our customers' networks,"" said Nokia.

Ericsson added: ""Today's decision removes the uncertainty that was slowing down investment decisions around the deployment of 5G in the UK... and we stand ready to work with the UK operators to meet their timetable.""

However, both firms manufacture some of their 5G equipment in China, which has also caused concern in Washington.

In June, the US Department of Defense published a list of 20 companies it claimed had close ties to the Chinese military.

It included Panda Electronics - the firm with which Ericsson jointly runs a manufacturing facility in the Chinese city of Nanjing.

""A lot of companies assemble equipment or have some type of manufacturing in China,"" Ericsson's head of corporate communications Peter Olofsson told the BBC, when asked about this.

""Our trade compliance people have looked at this [list] and they concluded that it's not something that has an impact on Ericsson or our operations.""

Huawei's UK research bases

One consequence of shunning Huawei is that it might lead the company to rethink its research and development investments in the country.

The firm has sponsored work at several universities including Imperial College, London, Southampton and Surrey.

In addition, it operates research centres of its own employing a total of 400 people in:

Edinburgh

Bristol

Cambridge

Ipswich

The company also recently gained planning permission to build a new £1bn research centre at Sawston - a large village to the south of Cambridge. It has said the development would create hundreds of further jobs.

But one expert said the new restrictions might not mean the project will be abandoned.

""The research centre in Cambridge has been many years in the planning, and may well be its future sourcing of important technologies within the global supply chain, so Huawei might want to keep it if it is allowed,"" said Emily Taylor from the Chatham House think tank.

Where is Huawei's kit used in UK?

Mobile networks can be divided into two parts: the core and the radio access network (Ran).

The core is likened to the brain and carries out the most sensitive operations, including authenticating users' identities and making sure calls get sent to the right radio tower to connect to another person's phone.

The Ran includes the base stations and antennas used to provide a link between individual mobile devices and the core. Insiders sometimes describe this as the ""innovative but dumb"" part of the network.

BT's EE mobile network features Huawei in the core of its 4G and 5G networks, but the firm is in the process of replacing it with Ericsson's products, and has promised to do so by the end of 2023.

Otherwise, the UK's main mobile providers only use Huawei in the Ran, and then always as part of a mix with at least one other vendor:

EE to provide 2G, 4G and 5G

Vodafone to provide 2G, 3G, 4G and 5G

Three to provide 4G and 5G

O2 to provide 5G at a relatively small number of sites in London, where it tested the equipment before opting to go with other suppliers elsewhere

Huawei also provides broadband equipment to BT's Openreach division, which owns the infrastructure used by other internet service providers (ISP), including Plusnet, Sky and TalkTalk.

These days, the focus is on rolling out fibre-to-the-premises (FTTP) connections, which offer the fastest speeds and are key to delivering the government's ""gigabit for all"" 2025 pledge.

In this case, Openreach uses Huawei's kit at what it calls the ""headend"" - a gateway at local telephone exchanges that converts electrical signals to and from light-based ones, and makes sure each customer's data is sent to the appropriate ISP.

Many people still get their internet via slower connections, which are routed via intermediary street cabinets.

About 70,000 of these cabinets contain Huawei's kit, and the data also passes through more of the Chinese firm's products at local exchanges.

Openreach does not, however, use Huawei's equipment in its core.

Elsewhere, CityFibre - which runs its own smaller full-fibre networks - uses some Huawei gear as a legacy of an acquisition, but intends to strip it out by mid-2021.

Virgin Media does not use Huawei's equipment within its broadband network.

But it does use it to provide telephone services, both for internet-based landline calls as well as to provide mobile phone subscriptions.

Other mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) - including Sky Mobile and GiffGaff - also use Huawei's gear.

It effectively sits between each MVNO and the mobile network whose infrastructure is used, and helps calculate customer bills, among other IT services.",2020-07-14,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-53403793
Stacy Cowley,Stocks Fall as Earnings Season Begins: Live Updates,"Live Updated July 14, 2020, 9:33 a.m. ET July 14, 2020, 9:33 a.m. ET Stocks Fall as Earnings Season Begins: Live Updates

Wells Fargo reports first quarterly loss in more than a decade. Credit... Zack Wittman for The New York Times Wells Fargo on Tuesday reported its first quarterly loss since 2008, losing $2.4 billion as the pandemic’s economic shocks ravaged nearly every line of its business. In a sign of more trouble ahead, the bank added $8.4 billion to its reserve for loan losses, more than twice what it set aside last quarter. It said it would, for the first time since the Great Recession, cut its dividend this quarter, dropping its payments to investors to 10 cents a share, down from the 51 cents it has paid for the last few quarters. Charles W. Scharf, the bank’s chief executive, said he was “extremely disappointed” with the bank’s performance. “While the negative impact of the pandemic is unprecedented and many of our business drivers were negatively impacted, our franchise should perform better,” he said in a statement. “We will make changes to improve our performance regardless of the operating environment.” The bank’s revenue for its second quarter, which ended June 30, dropped to $17.8 billion, down nearly 18 percent from a year ago. Last year, it earned $6.2 billion during the quarter. Wells Fargo is bracing for coming losses on its commercial loans, especially in real estate, where it set aside $6.4 billion. Consumer loans, especially mortgages, are also flashing warning lights; the bank added $2 billion to cover anticipated losses there.

Delta’s revenue plummets by 88 percent. Delta Air Lines planes in Birmingham, Ala., in March. Credit... Elijah Nouvelage/Reuters Revenue at Delta Air Lines declined by 88 percent in the second quarter compared to a year earlier, reflecting what its chief executive described as the “truly staggering” toll the coronavirus pandemic has had on the aviation industry. That decline contributed to a $5.7 billion quarterly loss, compared to last year’s $1.4 billion profit. “Given the combined effects of the pandemic and associated financial impact on the global economy, we continue to believe that it will be more than two years before we see a sustainable recovery,” Ed Bastian, Delta’s chief executive officer, said in a statement. Delta said it ended the quarter with $15.7 billion in cash on hand and cut its daily cash losses to $27 million per day, down from $100 million per day during the depths of the crisis. The company hopes to stop that daily bleeding by year’s end. The company’s quarterly losses were driven by a 93 percent decline in passengers, though they included a more than $2 billion write-down associated with investments in a trio of troubled foreign carriers: Latam Airlines Group, Grupo Aeroméxico and Virgin Atlantic. More than 45,000 employees have taken temporary voluntary unpaid leave. Last week, United Airlines said it could furlough as many as 36,000 workers when federal stimulus funding for payroll runs out at the end of September. Delta has not yet detailed what impact the expiration of funds may have, though it did warn nearly 2,600 pilots last week that they could be furloughed.

Pandemic preparations cut JPMorgan’s second quarter earnings in half. Credit... Amr Alfiky for The New York Times JPMorgan Chase on Tuesday revealed that it had earned $4.7 billion during the months of April, May and June, just under half of what it earned during the same period a year ago, as it diverted billions of dollars to a reserve fund in order to prepare for a potential economic shock. Despite the drop in earnings, another number suggested a boom time. While businesses and many regular services in vast swaths of the United States were closed to try to stem the coronavirus pandemic, JPMorgan brought in the largest quarterly revenue haul in its history: nearly $34 billion, compared to just over $29 billion in the second quarter of 2019. The increase was driven by a surge in its Wall Street businesses, including trading in stocks, bonds and other financial market instruments, where a record haul of $16 billion in JPMorgan’s Corporate & Investment Bank division represented a 66 percent increase from last year. The bank added nearly $11 billion to the pool of money it keeps ready to cover any losses, $9 billion more than last year. Of that, almost $6 billion was designated to handle losses on loans to consumers, including credit cards.

Citigroup reports a 73 percent dip in quarterly profit. Citibank in Brooklyn, New York. Credit... John Taggart for The New York Times Citigroup said Tuesday that its quarterly profit fell 73 percent as it set aside $5.6 billion to cover loan losses triggered by the widespread unemployment caused by the pandemic. As the third largest credit issuer in the United States, Citigroup is particularly vulnerable to increases in credit card delinquencies, which tend to dovetail with rises in unemployment. The bank said it has offered forbearance on 2 million credit card accounts representing six percent of balances so far. Net income fell to $1.3 billion in the second quarter of 2020 from $4.8 billion a year ago. Revenue rose 5 percent to $19.77 billion as the pace of trading activity rose.

Britain’s economic recovery disappointed in May as businesses started to reopen. Handing off an order to a customer outside a bookshop in London, last month. The economic outlook for the rest of this year in Britain remains bleak. Credit... Alberto Pezzali/Associated Press May was supposed to be the first month of Britain’s economic recovery, when some restrictions on business activity were eased after the near-total lockdown of April. Some economists predicted the economy would grow by 5.5 percent after contracting by nearly 7 percent in March and a further 20 percent in April. But the data announced Tuesday was greeted as a disappointment, showing just a 1.8 percent increase from the month before. The British government allowed some manufacturing and construction activity to resume in mid-May, and output in both sectors rose by more than 8 percent. However, the larger services sector remained lackluster, growing by less than 1 percent from April, as about 16 percent of businesses reported having no revenue in the month. The outlook for the rest of this year remains bleak. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility laid out three scenarios for the trajectory of the British economy, all of which foresee an unprecedented increase in public borrowing to try to offset the economic shock of the pandemic. “The U.K. is on track to record the largest decline in annual G.D.P. for 300 years, with output falling by more than 10 percent in 2020 in all three scenarios,” the OBR said in a report published Tuesday. In its central scenario, the office said economic output would return to its pre-pandemic peak by the end of 2022, and the unemployment rate would rise to 10.1 percent next year.

Wall Street is unsteady as global markets tumble. A Covid-19 testing site in Los Angeles last week. Credit... Jenna Schoenefeld for The New York Times Stocks fell on Tuesday amid a re-tightening of restrictions on businesses and fresh data showing slower-than-expected economic activity. The S&P 500 fell about half a percent in early trading. European markets were broadly lower, most by more than 1 percent and stocks in Asia also fell. On Wall Street, the decline added to a sell-off that began late on Monday as concern about the continued spread of the coronavirus overwhelmed an early rally. The S&P 500 dropped more than 2 percent from its highest point on Monday, to end the day with a nearly 1 percent decline. Stock trading has become more turbulent lately amid rising concerns that large states would have to pull back on their reopening plans. In California, the governor announced a sweeping rollback on Monday, ordering the closure of indoor operations statewide for restaurants, wineries, movie theaters and zoos. Bars would also be forced to close all operations. Similar actions were predicted in Texas. Adding to the uncertainty is earnings season, which offers investors their first chance to hear from businesses about how the pandemic has hurt profits. On Tuesday, JPMorgan reported that its earnings had halved in the second quarter, while Wells Fargo had its first quarterly loss since 2008, and Delta Air Lines said revenue plunged by 88 percent. In Britain, there were hopes that the government’s economic data for May, when some restrictions on businesses eased following April’s near-total lockdown, would show a strong upswing from the month before. But the data released Tuesday reported that the economy grew by only 1.8 percent in May, far less than the 5.5 percent widely predicted. The government’s independent budget review office said Britain was on track for “the largest decline in annual G.D.P. for 300 years.”

As Europe’s economies reopen, consumers go on a spending spree. Credit... Andrea Chronopoulos Consumers in Europe are going on a shopping spree as their economies reopen, offering hope that a fragile recovery from a deep pandemic-induced recession may be taking hold. Retail sales in the eurozone, which plunged to record lows while millions were confined, surged 17.8 percent in May compared with the month before, as people fanned out to buy furniture, electronics, clothing and computer equipment, Europe’s statistics agency reported this week. The biggest gains are in France and Germany, where spending has rebounded to near pre-confinement levels. The current binge has doused some worries that Europeans might feel too shaken to spend again, as happened in China, where many chose to curtail expenditures after losing their jobs or having their pay slashed. “Consumers are driving the rebound across much of Europe more than expected,” said Holger Schmieding, chief economist of Berenberg Bank. “There is a relief that lockdowns are over.” But whether people will keep opening their wallets remains to be seen. Spending is still around 7 percent lower than where it was before the pandemic hit. For now, at least, patrons have not stopped flocking to socially distanced sidewalk tables at cafes and bistros in France. Dutch flower and plant suppliers are reporting record demand as shoppers crowd do-it-yourself stores around Europe to beautify their homes. In Germany, families are heading to malls to buy new appliances after the government lowered the value-added tax to stimulate sales.

Ad Council In March, the Advertising Council, a nonprofit organization that creates public service announcements about social issues, was days away from introducing a campaign with the White House about work force training when the economy locked down. The ads finally debuted on Tuesday, retooled to address the pandemic’s devastating effect on jobs. With more than 18 million workers receiving jobless benefits in late June, the effort focuses on education and certification resources that can be found online. The campaign, created with partners like Apple and IBM, was originally called “Choose Something New,” meant as an inspirational message to people looking to change career paths. It became “Find Something New,” focusing on those struggling to find work during a national emergency. “The tone of the campaign really needed to shift to be more urgent and actionable,” said Michelle Hillman, the chief campaign development officer at Ad Council. “We needed to really understand the landscape of what was happening.” More companies are cautiously venturing back into marketing as states try to reopen. After several months focusing on health-related messaging, Ad Council recently revisited the work force campaign, which now includes rewritten copy and workers filmed at a distance using iPhones. The campaign will run in space donated by television networks like Fox and NBC, digital platforms like Facebook and Snap and in print publications and on billboards. Viewers will be directed to resources at FindSomethingNew.org.

‘I can’t keep doing this’: Small-business owners are giving up. Gabriel Gordon shuttered his popular barbecue restaurant in California after the state saw a resurgence of coronavirus cases and imposed new restrictions. Credit... Horatio Baltz for The New York Times It was harrowing enough for small businesses — the bars, dental care practices, small law firms, day care centers and other storefronts that dot the streets of every American town and city — to have to shut down after state officials imposed lockdowns in March to contain the pandemic. But the resurgence of the virus, especially in states such as California, Florida and Texas that had begun to reopen, has introduced a far darker reality for many small businesses: Their temporary closures might become permanent. Nearly 66,000 businesses have folded since March 1, according to data from Yelp, which provides a platform for local businesses to advertise their services and has been tracking announcements of closings posted on its site. Small businesses account for 44 percent of all U.S. economic activity, according to the Small Business Administration, and closures on such an immense scale could devastate the country’s economic growth. On the last Friday of June, after Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas said that bars across the state would have to shut down a second time because coronavirus cases were skyrocketing, Mick Larkin decided he had enough. He and his partner decided to close their club, Krank It Karaoke in Wichita Falls, Texas, for good. “We did everything we were supposed to do,” Mr. Larkin said. “When he shut us down again, and after I put out all that money to meet their rules, I just said, ‘I can’t keep doing this.’”",2020-07-14,https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/07/14/business/stock-market-updates-coronavirus
Adam Satariano,"U.K. Bans Huawei From 5G Network, Raising Tensions With China","LONDON — Britain announced on Tuesday that it would ban equipment from the Chinese technology giant Huawei from the country’s high-speed wireless network, a victory for the Trump administration and a reversal of an earlier decision that underscores how technology has taken center stage in the deepening divide between Western powers and China.

In January Britain said that Huawei equipment could be used in its new 5G network on a limited basis. But since then Prime Minister Boris Johnson has faced growing political pressure domestically to take a harder line against Beijing, and in May the United States imposed new restrictions to disrupt Huawei’s access to important components.

Britain’s about-face signals a new willingness among Western countries to confront China, a determination that has grown firmer since Beijing last month adopted a sweeping new law to tighten its grip on Hong Kong, the semiautonomous city that was a British colony until 1997. On Tuesday, Robert O’Brien, President Trump’s national security adviser, was in Paris for meetings about China with counterparts from Britain, France, Germany and Italy.

Huawei’s critics say its close ties to the Chinese government mean Beijing could use the equipment for espionage or to disrupt telecommunications — a point the company strongly disputes.",2020-07-14,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/business/huawei-uk-5g.html
